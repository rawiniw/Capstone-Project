from time to time, the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, for the terms and conditions of the Offer and the subsequent merger of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such
merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Kroger (such merger, the &#147;Merger&#148;). In addition, concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, Kroger and Purchaser entered into Tender and Support Agreements with each of the
Supporting Stockholders (as defined below in Section&nbsp;11 &#150; &#147;The Merger Agreement; Other Agreements &#150; Tender and Support Agreements&#148;), which provide that each Supporting Stockholder will tender into the Offer, and, subject to
certain exceptions, not withdraw, all outstanding Shares such Supporting Stockholder owns of record or beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act). </P>

and the Offer is consummated, in exchange for your Shares in the Merger, will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, provided that you hold your Shares as capital assets, you will recognize capital gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the Offer Price and (ii)&nbsp;your adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the Offer or exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain
or loss if you have held the Shares for more than one year as of the date of your sale or exchange of the Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger. See Section&nbsp;5 &#150; &#147;Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Offer&#148; for

by such stockholder and accepted for payment by Purchaser and with respect to any and all other Shares or other securities or rights issued or issuable in respect of such Shares. All such powers of attorney and proxies will be considered irrevocable
and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares. Such appointment will be effective when, and only to the extent that, we accept for payment Shares tendered by such stockholder as provided herein. Upon such appointment, all prior powers of
attorney, proxies and consents given by such stockholder with respect to such Shares or other securities or rights will, without further action, be revoked and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations may be given by such
stockholder (and, if given, will not be deemed effective). The designees of Purchaser will thereby be empowered to exercise all voting and other rights with respect to such Shares and other securities or rights, including, without limitation, in

exemption should complete and return the IRS Form W-9 included in the Letter of Transmittal, certifying that such stockholder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that such stockholder is not subject to
backup withholding. Any foreign stockholder should submit an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or other applicable IRS Form W-8), attesting to such stockholder&#146;s exempt foreign status in order to qualify for an exemption from
information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund from the IRS or a credit against a stockholder&#146;s U.S. federal income
tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="oprom757650_7"></A>4. Withdrawal Rights. </B></P>

whose Shares are tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer or whose Shares are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger. The summary is for general information only and does not purport to consider all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that might be relevant to stockholders of the Company. The summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), existing, proposed and temporary regulations
thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this Offer, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS
or any opinion of counsel with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed herein, or that a court will not sustain any challenge
by the IRS in the event of litigation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The summary applies only to stockholders of the Company in whose hands Shares are capital assets

purposes of this summary, the term &#147;U.S. Holder&#148; means a beneficial owner of Shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is: (i)&nbsp;an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii)&nbsp;a corporation, or an entity
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii)&nbsp;an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax

such laws. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exchange of Shares for cash pursuant to the Offer or the Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S.&nbsp;Holders for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder who sells Shares pursuant to the Offer or receives cash in exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to
the difference, if any, between (i)&nbsp;the amount of cash received (determined before the deduction of any withholding tax) and (ii)&nbsp;the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the Shares sold pursuant to the Offer or exchanged for cash
pursuant to the Merger. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each block of Shares (that is, Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) tendered pursuant to the Offer or exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. Such gain or
loss will be long-term capital gain or loss, provided that a U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period for such block of Shares is more than one year at the time of consummation of the Offer or the Merger, as the case may be. Capital gains recognized by an
individual upon a disposition of a Share that has been held for more than one year generally will be subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20%. In addition, certain non-corporate stockholders may be subject to an additional 3.8% tax
on all or a portion of their &#147;net investment income,&#148; which may include all or a portion of the gain recognized in connection with the Offer or the Merger. In the case of a Share that has been held for one year or less, such capital gains
generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates. Certain limitations apply to the use of a U.S. Holder&#146;s capital losses. </P>

Continuing Director(s); and provided further, that the remaining Continuing Director will fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten business days; and further provided, that if no such Continuing Director is appointed
in such time period, Kroger will designate such Continuing Director; provided further, that if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors will designate two persons who will not be affiliates, consultants, representatives or employees
of Kroger or any of its subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such persons will be deemed to be Continuing Directors. </P>

Stockholder&#148;). Excluding Shares underlying options, restricted stock units and warrants, as of June&nbsp;27, 2014, the Supporting Stockholders collectively beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 8,935,440 Shares (or approximately 26.2% of all
Shares outstanding as of June&nbsp;27, 2014). Including Shares which may be issued under options and warrants which are exercisable for or may become vested and settled for Shares, the Supporting Stockholders collectively beneficially owned, in the
aggregate, 11,796,327 Shares as of June&nbsp;27, 2014 (or approximately 32.0% of the total of all Shares that are outstanding and all additional Shares that are deemed outstanding for purposes of calculating the Supporting Stockholders&#146;
percentage ownership in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act as of June&nbsp;27, 2014). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Tender and Support
Agreements provide that, no later than five business days after the commencement of the Offer, each Supporting Stockholder will tender into the Offer, and, subject to certain exceptions, will not withdraw, all outstanding Shares such Supporting
Stockholder owns of record or beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) as of the date of the Tender and Support Agreements, along with any additional outstanding Shares of which such Supporting Stockholder acquires
record ownership or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) during the Support Period (as defined below) (collectively, the &#147;Subject Shares&#148;). Such Supporting Stockholder will tender into the Offer
additional Shares acquired after the date of the Tender and Support Agreements within three business days after acquiring ownership of such additional Shares. The Tender and Support Agreements provide that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Supporting Stockholders will not be required to exercise any options or other equity awards thereunder or to purchase any Shares pursuant to any warrants or otherwise. The Tender and Support Agreements also provide that, during the period from the
date of the Tender and Support Agreements until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date the Merger Agreement is validly terminated (such period, the &#147;Support Period&#148;), the Supporting Stockholders will vote their Subject
Shares against certain alternative corporate transactions (as more fully described in the Tender and Support Agreements). The Tender and Support Agreements provide that Kroger is appointed as the attorney-in-fact and proxy of the Supporting

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Purpose of the Offer. </I>The purpose of the Offer is for Kroger, through Purchaser, to acquire control of, and the entire equity interest
in, the Company. The Offer is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all outstanding Shares. The purpose of the Merger is to acquire all outstanding Shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is consummated, Purchaser
intends to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company Board has approved the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Offer and the Merger. If the Offer is consummated, we do not anticipate seeking the approval of the Company&#146;s remaining stockholders before effecting the Merger. Section&nbsp;251(h) of the DGCL
provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation, and subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the constituent corporation that
would otherwise be required to approve a merger for the constituent corporation, and the other stockholders receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the acquirer can effect a merger without the
action of the other stockholders of the constituent corporation. Accordingly, if we consummate the Offer, we intend to complete the Merger without a vote of the Company&#146;s stockholders in accordance with Section&nbsp;251(h) of the DGCL. If we
are prohibited from effecting the Merger in accordance with Section&nbsp;251(h) of the DGCL, we reserve the right to effect the Merger in another manner that complies with the requirements of the DGCL. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with Kroger&#146;s consideration of the Offer, Kroger has developed a plan, on the basis of available information, for the
combination of the business of the Company with that of Kroger. Kroger plans to integrate the Company&#146;s business into Kroger. Kroger will continue to evaluate and refine the plan and may make changes to it as additional information is obtained.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Except as set forth in this Offer to Purchase and the Merger Agreement, Kroger and Purchaser have no present plans or proposals that
would relate to or result in (i)&nbsp;any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (such as a merger, reorganization, liquidation, relocation of any operations or sale or other transfer of a material
amount of assets), (ii)&nbsp;any sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii)&nbsp;any material change in the Company&#146;s capitalization or dividend policy or (iv)&nbsp;any other material change

Immediately following the Merger, all of the outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s common stock will be held by Kroger. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Market
for the Shares.</I> The purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of holders of Shares and the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining
Shares. We cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of Shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for, or marketability of, the Shares or whether such reduction would cause
future market prices to be greater or less than the Offer Price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock Quotation</I>. Depending upon the number of Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer, the Shares may no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Market if, among other things, the Company does not meet the requirements for the number of publicly held Shares, the aggregate market
value of the publicly held Shares or the number of market makers for the Shares. Kroger will seek to cause the listing of Shares on the NASDAQ Global Market to be discontinued as soon after the consummation of the Offer as the requirements for
termination of the listing are satisfied. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the NASDAQ Global Market were to delist the Shares, it is possible that the Shares would
continue to trade on other securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market and that price or other quotations of the Shares would be reported by other sources. The extent of the public market for such Shares and the availability of such
quotations would depend, however, upon such factors as the number of stockholders and the aggregate market value of such securities remaining at such time, the interest in maintaining a market in the Shares on the part of securities firms, the
possible termination of registration under the Exchange Act, and other factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Margin Regulations.</I> The Shares are currently
&#147;margin securities&#148; under the Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;), which has the effect, among other things, of allowing brokers to extend credit based on the use of
Shares as collateral. Depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding the market for the Shares and stock quotations, it is possible that, following the Offer, the Shares would no longer constitute &#147;margin securities&#148; for
the purposes of the margin regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and, therefore, could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Exchange Act Registration.</I> The Shares are currently registered under the Exchange Act. Such registration may be terminated upon
application of the Company to the SEC if the Shares are neither listed on a national securities exchange nor held by 300 or more holders of record. Termination of registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act would substantially reduce the
information required to be furnished by the Company to its stockholders and to the SEC and would make certain provisions of the Exchange Act no longer applicable to the Company, such as the short-swing profit recovery provisions of
Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act, the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to Section&nbsp;14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with stockholders&#146; meetings and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to
stockholders and the requirements of Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to &#147;going private&#148; transactions. Furthermore, the ability of &#147;affiliates&#148; of the Company and persons holding &#147;restricted securities&#148; of
the Company to dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be impaired or eliminated. If registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act were terminated, the Shares would no longer be
&#147;margin securities&#148; or be eligible for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market. We intend to cause the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ Global Market and the termination of the registration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as soon
after completion of the Merger as the requirements for such delisting and termination of registration are satisfied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="oprom757650_17"></A>14.

the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Acceptance Time, except as approved by Kroger (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company will not declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, shares or property or any combination thereof) in respect of any shares of capital stock, or make any other actual, constructive or deemed distribution in respect of the shares of capital stock, except for cash
dividends made by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to the Company or one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="oprom757650_18">

event that such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken, adverse consequences might not result to the Company&#146;s business or that certain parts of the Company&#146;s business might not have to be disposed of or held
separate, any of which may give us the right to terminate the Offer at any Expiration Date without accepting for payment any Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer. Our obligation under the Offer to accept for payment and
pay for Shares is subject to the conditions to the Offer, including, among other conditions, the Antitrust Condition. See Section&nbsp;15 &#150; &#147;Conditions of the Offer.&#148; </P>

&#147;FTC&#148;)), certain acquisition transactions, including Purchaser&#146;s purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, may not be consummated until certain information and documentary material has been furnished for review by the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the &#147;Antitrust Division&#148;) and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Pursuant to the HSR Act, on July&nbsp;16, 2014, Kroger and the Company filed their respective
Premerger Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the HSR Act, Purchaser&#146;s purchase of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to an initial waiting period that will expire at 11:59 pm, EDT on July&nbsp;31, 2014. However, the initial waiting period may be terminated prior to such date and time by the FTC and the Antitrust Division, or
we may receive a request (a &#147;Second Request&#148;) for additional information or documentary material from either the FTC or the Antitrust Division prior to such expiration. If the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a Second Request, the
waiting period with respect to the Offer will be extended for an additional period of 10 calendar days, which will begin on the date on which we have substantially complied with the Second Request. Complying with a Second Request can take a
significant period of time. If either the 15-day or 10-day waiting period expires on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, then such waiting period will be extended until 11:59 p.m. of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday.
Only one extension of the waiting period pursuant to a Second Request is authorized by the HSR Act. After that time, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with our consent. The FTC or the Antitrust Division may terminate the
additional 10-day waiting period before its expiration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FTC and the Antitrust Division frequently scrutinize the legality under the
U.S. antitrust laws of transactions like the Offer and the Merger. At any time, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take any action under the antitrust laws that it considers necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking
(i)&nbsp;to enjoin the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;to enjoin the Merger, (iii)&nbsp;to require Purchaser (or, after completion of the Merger, Kroger) to divest the Shares, or (iv)&nbsp;to require us or the Company to divest
substantial assets. Private parties, as well as state attorneys general, also may bring legal actions under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. See Section&nbsp;15 &#150; &#147;Conditions of the Offer.&#148; </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based upon an examination of publicly available information and other information relating to the
businesses in which the Company is engaged, we and the Company believe that neither the purchase of Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer nor the consummation of the Merger should violate applicable antitrust laws. Nevertheless, neither we nor
the Company can be certain that a challenge to the Offer or the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made, or, if such challenge is made, what the result will be. See Section&nbsp;15 &#150; &#147;Conditions of the Offer.&#148; </P>

Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. In general, Section&nbsp;203 of the DGCL prevents a Delaware corporation from engaging in a &#147;business combination&#148; (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with
an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; (including a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation&#146;s outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years following the date such person became an &#147;interested
stockholder&#148; unless, among other things, the &#147;business combination&#148; is approved by the board of directors of such corporation before such person became an &#147;interested stockholder.&#148; The Company Board approved the Merger
Agreement on July&nbsp;1, 2014, and, therefore, Section&nbsp;203 of the DGCL is inapplicable to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of states have adopted laws and regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated, or
have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business, or whose business operations otherwise have substantial economic effects, in such states. In 1982, in <I>Edgar v. MITE Corp.</I>, the Supreme Court
of the United States invalidated on constitutional grounds the Illinois Business Takeover Statute which, as a matter of state securities law, made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult. However, in 1987, in <I>CTS
Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America</I>, the Supreme Court held that the State of Indiana could, as a matter of corporate law, constitutionally disqualify a potential acquirer from voting shares of a target corporation without the prior approval of
the remaining stockholders where, among other things, the corporation is incorporated, and has a substantial number of stockholders, in the state. Subsequently, in <I>TLX Acquisition Corp. v. Telex Corp.</I>, a U.S. federal district court in
Oklahoma ruled that the Oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Oklahoma in that they would subject such corporations to inconsistent regulations. Similarly, in <I>Tyson Foods, Inc. v. McReynolds</I>,
a U.S. federal district court in Tennessee ruled that four Tennessee takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside Tennessee. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. In December 1988, a U.S. federal district court in Florida held in <I>Grand Metropolitan PLC v. Butterworth</I> that the provisions of the Florida Affiliated Transactions Act and the Florida Control Share Acquisition Act were
unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside of Florida. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company, directly or through subsidiaries, conducts
business in a number of states throughout the United States, some of which have enacted takeover laws. We do not know whether any of these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger and have not attempted to comply with any such
laws. Should any person seek to apply any state takeover law, we will take such action as then appears desirable, which may include challenging the validity or applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings. In the event any
person asserts that the takeover laws of any state are applicable to the Offer or the Merger, and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the Offer or the Merger, we may be required to file certain
information with, or receive approvals from, the relevant state authorities. In addition, if enjoined, we may be unable to accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, or be delayed in continuing or consummating the Offer and the
Merger. In such case, we may not be obligated to accept for payment any Shares tendered in the Offer. See Section&nbsp;15 &#150; &#147;Conditions of the Offer.&#148; </P>

behalf of purported stockholders of the Company against the Company, its directors, Kroger and Purchaser. The actions are captioned <I>John Ernst v. Vitacost.com, Inc., et al.</I>,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-CA-008318,</FONT></FONT> which was filed on July&nbsp;7, 2014 in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit In and For Palm Beach County, Florida (the &#147;<I>Ernst</I>
Action&#148;), and <I>Marcel Heim v. Vitacost.com, Inc., et al.</I>, C.A. No.&nbsp;9883-VCP, which was filed on July&nbsp;15, 2014 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (together with the <I>Ernst</I> Action, the &#147;Stockholder
Actions&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of the Stockholder Actions alleges that the Company&#146;s directors breached their fiduciary duties to the
Company&#146;s stockholders in connection with their consideration and approval of the Merger Agreement by, among other things, agreeing to an inadequate tender price through an inadequate sales process. The Stockholder Actions also allege that the
Company, Kroger and Purchaser aided and abetted the Company&#146;s directors&#146; alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Stockholder

rights will be available in connection with the Merger as further described below, but, although the availability of appraisal rights depends on the Merger being completed, stockholders who wish to exercise such appraisal rights must do so no later
than the time of the consummation of the Offer, even though the Merger will not have been completed as of such time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Merger is
completed, the holders of Shares who (i)&nbsp;did not tender their Shares in the Offer; (ii)&nbsp;follow the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL; and (iii)&nbsp;do not thereafter lose their appraisal rights (by withdrawal, failure
to perfect or otherwise), in each case in accordance with the DGCL, will be entitled to have their Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and receive payment of the &#147;fair value&#148; of such Shares, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of interest, as determined by such court. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
&#147;fair value&#148; of any Shares could be based upon considerations other than, or in addition to, the price paid in the Offer and the market value of such Shares. Moreover, the &#147;fair value&#148; so determined could be higher or lower than,
or the same as, the Offer Price. Moreover, we may argue in an appraisal proceeding that, for purposes of such proceeding, the fair value of such Shares is less than the Offer Price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL provides that, if a merger was approved pursuant to Section&nbsp;251(h), either a constituent corporation before

which the undersigned hereby acknowledges the undersigned has received (the &#147;Offer to Purchase,&#148; which, together with this Letter of Transmittal, as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively constitute the
&#147;Offer&#148;). The Offer expires on the Expiration Date. &#147;Expiration Date&#148; means 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August&nbsp;15, 2014, unless we, in accordance with the Offer, extend the period during which the Offer is open, in
which event the term &#147;Expiration Date&#148; means the latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended, expires. The undersigned hereby acknowledges that Purchaser reserves the right to transfer or assign, from time to time, in whole or
in part, to one or more of its affiliates, without the consent of Vitacost, the right to purchase the Shares tendered herewith. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), subject to, and effective upon, acceptance for payment for the Shares validly tendered herewith and not

in their sole discretion, may deem proper at any annual, special, adjourned or postponed meeting of Vitacost&#146;s stockholders, by written consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise as such designee, in its, his or her sole discretion, deems
proper with respect to all Shares and any Distributions. This proxy and power of attorney shall be irrevocable and coupled with an interest in the tendered Shares and any Distributions. Such appointment is effective when, and only to the extent
that, Purchaser accepts the Shares tendered with this Letter of Transmittal for payment pursuant to the Offer. Upon the effectiveness of such appointment, without further action, all prior powers of attorney, proxies and consents given by the
undersigned with respect to such Shares and any associated Distributions (other than prior powers of attorney, proxies or consent given by the undersigned to Purchaser or Kroger) will be revoked, and no subsequent powers of attorney, proxies,
consents or revocations (other than powers of attorney, proxies, consents or revocations given to Purchaser or Kroger) may be given (and, if given, will not be deemed effective). Purchaser reserves the right to require that, in order for Shares to

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. <B>Backup Withholding.</B> Under U.S. federal income tax laws, the Depositary will be required to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made to
certain stockholders pursuant to the Offer, as applicable. In order to avoid such backup withholding, each tendering stockholder or payee that is a United States person (for U.S. federal income tax purposes), must provide the Depositary with such
stockholder&#146;s or payee&#146;s correct taxpayer identification number (&#147;TIN&#148;) and certify that such stockholder or payee is not subject to such backup withholding by completing the attached IRS Form W-9. If a tendering U.S. stockholder
has been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that such stockholder is subject to backup withholding, such stockholder must cross out item 2 in Part II of the IRS Form W-9, unless such stockholder has since been notified by the Internal Revenue
Service that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding. Failure to provide the information on the IRS Form W-9 may subject the tendering stockholder to federal income tax withholding on the payment of the Offer Price for all Shares
purchased from such stockholder. If the tendering U.S. stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for one or intends to apply for one in the near future, such stockholder should write &#147;Applied For&#148; in Part I of the IRS Form W-9,
and sign and date the IRS Form W-9. If the tendering stockholder wrote &#147;Applied For&#148; in Part I and the Depositary is not provided with a TIN by the time of payment, the Depositary will withhold a portion of all payments of the Offer Price
to such stockholder until a TIN is provided to the Depositary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain stockholders or payees (including, among others, corporations, and certain
non-resident alien individuals and foreign entities) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting requirements. A tendering stockholder who is a foreign individual or a foreign entity should complete, sign, and submit to the Depositary
the appropriate IRS Form W-8. The appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be downloaded from the Internal Revenue Service&#146;s website at the following address: <I>http://www.irs.gov.</I> Failure to complete the IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate IRS Form W-8
will not, by itself, cause Shares to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may require the Depositary to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made of the Offer Price pursuant to the Offer. </P>

federal income tax law, a stockholder that is a non-exempt United States person (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) whose tendered Shares are accepted for payment, is required by law to provide the Depositary (as payer) with such
stockholder&#146;s correct TIN on the IRS Form W-9 below. If such stockholder is an individual, the TIN is such stockholder&#146;s social security number. If the Depositary is not provided with the correct TIN, the stockholder may be subject to
penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) and payments that are made to such stockholder with respect to Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer may be subject to backup withholding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If backup withholding applies, the Depositary is required to withhold 28% of any payments of the Offer Price made to the stockholder. Backup withholding is
not an additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may be obtained from the IRS provided that
the required information is furnished to the IRS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>IRS Form W-9 </B></P>

required to notify the Depositary of such stockholder&#146;s correct TIN by completing the IRS Form W-9 below, certifying, under penalties of perjury, (i)&nbsp;that the TIN provided on the IRS Form W-9 is correct (or that such stockholder is
awaiting a TIN), (ii)&nbsp;that such stockholder is not subject to backup withholding because (a)&nbsp;such stockholder has not been notified by the IRS that such stockholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all
interest or dividends, (b)&nbsp;the IRS has notified such stockholder that such stockholder is no longer subject to backup withholding or (c)&nbsp;such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding, and (iii)&nbsp;that such stockholder is a U.S.
person. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>What Number to Give the Depositary </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each
United States stockholder is generally required to give the Depositary its TIN (generally the stockholder&#146;s social security number or employer identification number). If the tendering stockholder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a
number or intends to apply for a number in the near future, the stockholder should write &#147;Applied For&#148; in Part I, and sign and date the IRS Form W-9 below. Notwithstanding that &#147;Applied For&#148; is written in Part I, the Depositary
will withhold 28% of all payments of the Offer Price to such stockholder until a TIN is provided to the Depositary. Such amounts will be refunded to such surrendering stockholder if a TIN is provided to the Depositary within 60 days. </P>

Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners&#146; share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain
cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a
partnership conducting a trade or business in the United&nbsp;States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.

<P STYLE="margin-top:2pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.</B> Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate
U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a &#147;saving clause.&#148; Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after
the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception

<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien. </P>

Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United&nbsp;States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to
the U.S.-China treaty (dated April&nbsp;30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under
paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that

in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding. </P>

information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA,
Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and state
agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally
withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information. </P>

stockholders for the purpose of receiving payments from Kroger and Purchaser and transmitting such payments to tendering stockholders whose Shares have been accepted for payment. If Purchaser extends the Offer, is delayed in its acceptance for
payment of Shares or is unable to accept Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer for any reason, then, without prejudice to Kroger&#146;s or Purchaser&#146;s rights under the Offer, the Depositary may retain tendered Shares on Purchaser&#146;s
