 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Response: Following is a proposed disclosure that responds to the comment: </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;The components of our executive compensation programs are equity incentive compensation, consisting solely of awards of equity
compensation (performance-based RSUs with a time-vesting component), base salary, a discretionary cash-bonus program, and other benefits (primarily consisting of health plans, a 401(k) plan and a deferred compensation plan). The Committee believes
that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the Company&#146;s long-standing approach to executive compensation, which has been to make performance-based equity awards the dominant form of compensation. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">RSU&#146;s &#151; RSU grants represent the largest component of compensation, based on their fair value at the time they are granted. The
Committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation above others helps to align the interests of employee-grantees with those of shareholders, both in the short term (with the performance conditions) and in the longer term (with
time-vesting of up to five years). To a lesser extent, the Committee also takes into account that longer-term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Base salary &#151; Base salary is the second largest compensation component. Payment of this level of fixed cash compensation is consistent with the need for executive officers to have a predictable
baseline of cash compensation, which has been subject generally to modest annual adjustments (with the exception of Messrs. Sinegal and Brotman, whose salaries have remained at the same level since 1999). </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Cash bonus &#151; Discretionary cash bonuses have formed a relatively small component of compensation. They address short-term incentives,
and are linked to performance during the fiscal year. Historically, at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year. The Committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with
preferring long-term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the Company and its shareholders. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Other elements
and perquisites &#151; Consistent with its position as a low-overhead operator, the Company has traditionally sought to have modest perquisites and &#147;other

compensation.&#148; A significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs (through the 401(k) and deferred compensation programs), recognizing

bonuses: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;The Named Executive Officers (other than Messrs. Brotman and Sinegal) received discretionary cash bonuses
ranging from approximately $24,000 to approximately $40,000, reduced from the prior year. Bonus criteria were approved by the Committee near the beginning of the fiscal year, based upon the recommendation of Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal. <I>After the close of
the fiscal year, Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal submits recommended bonus amounts to the Compensation Committee for consideration. The Committee maintains the discretion to vary from Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal&#146;s recommendation but historically has deferred to it.</I>
Roughly 50% of the bonus potential for fiscal year 2009 was determined with reference to an internal net income goal, which was not achieved. <I>Although Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal had the discretion to recommend some amount of income-related bonus despite
the failure to achieve the goal he chose not to do so. </I>Eligibility for the remaining portion of the bonus was determined with reference to performance measures relevant to the executive officer&#146;s area of responsibility: for those whose
responsibilities are operational, the goals related to sales, controllable expenses, inventory shrinkage, and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility; for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying, the goals related to sales, gross
