<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Under ASC 740-30-25-17, Costco Wholesale may overcome the presumption in ASC 740-30-25-3 that all undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will
be transferred to the parent entity and such undistributed earnings included in consolidated income generally shall be accounted for as a temporary difference and therefore will not have to accrue United States (U.S.) income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its subsidiary <U>if</U> sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely <U>or</U> that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation. This
includes a situation where repatriation of earnings would result in no recognition of a U.S. deferred tax liability. Although we have historically asserted that foreign undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, we may repatriate
undistributed earnings to the extent we can do so without adverse tax consequence. Repatriation of undistributed earnings without adverse tax consequence is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company evaluates our
positions regarding permanent reinvestment on at least a quarterly basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The Company has operated foreign subsidiaries for decades and
has generally taken the position that its undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates were permanently reinvested. The primary factor supporting the determination of permanent reinvestment, as previously discussed in our response to the Staff dated
April&nbsp;15, 2016, is the ability of the Company&#146;s U.S. operations to not only meet but significantly exceed its cash requirements without accessing foreign undistributed earnings. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">During the relevant periods, the Company consistently generated cash flow in the U.S. more
than sufficient to support the ongoing U.S. operations and expansion. At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company held cash and cash equivalents in the U.S. of nearly $2.7 billion and short-term investments of over $1 billion. In fiscal 2014 the U.S.
operations generated excess cash. At the end of fiscal 2014, the Company held cash and cash equivalents in the U.S. of over $2.7 billion and short-term investments of over $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2015 the U.S. operations generated excess cash. At
the end of fiscal 2015, notwithstanding having paid a special cash dividend of $2.2 billion (less than half of which was financed by external borrowing) the Company held cash and cash equivalents in the U.S. of over $2.8 billion and short-term
investments of over $1.4 billion. Expectations at the end of fiscal 2015 were that in fiscal 2016 the U.S. operations would continue to generate excess cash. In addition, through these periods, the Company maintained a balance sheet with the
capacity to borrow amounts well beyond existing borrowings while still maintaining a high credit rating. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In addition to the cash needs in
the U.S. not requiring repatriation of foreign earnings, with particular reference to Canada, the Company has earned higher returns for invested cash as compared to the U.S. (with comparable risk profiles). For fiscal years 2013-2015, the yields on
cash invested in Canada were three to five times those of the U.S. In light of the lack of need for cash in the U.S., the investment plans to seek superior returns for Canadian investments further buttressed the position that Canadian earnings were
permanently reinvested. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Of even greater significance, as indicated in our prior letter, is the projected need for investments in certain
of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries other than Canada which the Company has planned to fund with excess cash that may be generated in Canada. Nascent operations in France, Iceland, and Spain and more developed operations in Australia and
Japan are projected to be net users of cash in the coming years. The investment plans for these countries generally involve acquisition of real estate for and construction of buildings for new membership warehouse locations. In addition, the Company
is continually reviewing prospects for opening membership warehouses in other countries. In 2013 and 2014 the Company took steps to establish a foreign corporate vehicle to, at the appropriate time if desired, take ownership of our Canadian
subsidiaries to facilitate the receipt of cash from Canada to invest in other foreign operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The two repatriations in fiscal 2014
and fiscal 2015 from Canada to the U.S. were fully consistent with ASC 740-30-25-17 because, due to fluctuations in exchange rates and other factors, these repatriations were accomplished without adverse tax consequences and provided the Company
with greater financial flexibility. Neither event represented a change in the Company&#146;s position on permanent reinvestment. The amounts of the repatriations were $904 million in fiscal 2015 and $685 million in fiscal 2016; both amounts went to
the Company&#146;s U.S. </P>

operations. At the times of these repatriations the U.S. operations had, consistent with historical positions, a surplus of cash and did not require or need this cash for its own use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Neither event implies that there has been or should be a change in the Company&#146;s position concerning the $371 million of earnings
remaining in Canada at the end of fiscal 2015 or for future Canadian earnings. This balance of $371 million was necessary to meet the operating cash needs in Canada during fiscal 2016 when the actual cash balances have been as low as $105 million.
The Company&#146;s intention continues to be that unremitted earnings will be utilized for short-term cash needs in Canada (working capital and the opening of new membership warehouse locations) or for other foreign operations. In any case, the
Company does not project to need any undistributed Canadian earnings to meet cash needs in the U.S. Should the opportunity arise to repatriate some of these or future earnings without adverse tax consequences, as occurred during 2014 and 2015 (as
explained), the Company may again choose to do that which is consistent with the principles of ASC 740-30-25-17. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Please contact me if you
