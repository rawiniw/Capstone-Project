expense net is related to foreign currency gains table of tax provision or benefit from income for interim is determined an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in for which we may not realize related tax benefit primarily due to of foreign reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have valuation against the deferred tax assets associated with for which we may not realize related tax benefit our effective tax rate may also be adversely impacted by the amount of our income or loss relative to our income tax expense and in tax law such as the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of our tax benefit for the nine ended was million which included discrete tax expense primarily attributable to audit related in the nine ended we an income tax benefit of million which included discrete tax primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of

those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating the increase or decrease in resulting from in exchange from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating table of financial for use of non financial and other sec define and prescribe the for use of certain non financial information our of free cash flow operating with and without stock based compensation and the effect of foreign exchange on our consolidated of meet the definition of non financial free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with in accordance with and free cash flow should not be upon to the exclusion of financial free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development which are included in cash flow from we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash flow from since of property and equipment internal use and development are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of debt property and equipment acquired under capital and other for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash the following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure net cash provided by used in operating for the trailing twelve ended and in millions twelve net cash provided by used in operating of property and equipment internal use and development free cash flow net cash provided by used in net cash provided by used in operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our when stock based compensation and value such accordingly in addition unlike other
