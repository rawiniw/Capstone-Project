and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit related foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be affected by the adverse impact of state income and in certain foreign for which we may not realize related tax benefit partially offset by the favorable effect of the federal research and development credit we expect decline in the proportion of for which we may not realize related tax benefit in these are primarily due to of foreign which reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we record valuation against the deferred tax assets associated with for which we may not realize

variability in our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit related foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be affected by the adverse impact of state income tax and in certain foreign for which we may not realize related tax benefit partially offset by the favorable effect of the federal research and development credit we expect decline in the proportion of for which we may not realize related tax benefit in these are primarily due to of foreign which reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we record valuation against the deferred tax
