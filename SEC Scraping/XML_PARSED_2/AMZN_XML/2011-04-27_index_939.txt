will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language to the extent permitted by law in regard to calling special meeting that apply only to but not to management and or the board special allow to vote on important such as that can arise between annual if can not call special management may become insulated and investor may suffer input on the timing of is especially important during major unfold quickly and may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal does not impact our current power to call special meeting this proposal topic won more than support at sprint and the merit of this special meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for additional improvement in our corporate governance status and who together were of our executive pay committee each had more then director concern also our audit committee in addition and our highest negative the next highest negative were for ryder our lead director who is also of our audit committee all our other received far less negative our board was the only major corporate directorship for and this could indicate significant lack of current transferable director experience we had no shareholder right to proxy access cumulative voting shareholder written consent or an independent board chairman please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal to initiate the corporate governance and financial performance that we deserve special on end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by recommendation of the board of on item the board of that you vote against this proposal first while the board that it is important for to have the ability to call special shareholder our certificate of incorporation and already provide for this right and establish an ownership threshold for calling special meeting at of the to vote also with even minimal can present at annual and suggest director to the and corporate governance committee in light of these shareholder the board that lowering the ownership threshold for calling special shareholder is not necessary second special shareholder involve expense and take up the time and energy of the board and management and low ownership threshold for calling special shareholder us to greater likelihood of being subjected to unnecessary expense and disruption third low ownership threshold could expose to the risk of special being by few on narrow or short term rather than the long term best of and generally for example event driven hedge funds could use special to disrupt our business or to facilitate self serving financial by setting the ownership threshold for calling special meeting at no single shareholder can call special meeting due to dispersion of ownership finally the vast majority of that

potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas over the coming that could offset the growth of global or reduce below current whereas the stern review on the economics of climate change led by the former chief economist at the world bank that if we dont act the overall and of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least of global each year now and forever yet investment of global each year is enough for appropriate mitigation whereas in risk management firm that climate related will be felt throughout business model with for its raw supply essential assets and and its and the in which it is whereas increasingly believe that there is an intersection between climate change and corporate financial performance in may we find that while many acknowledge the climate change there are significant in the extent to which are taking action in the effectiveness of response across create to lose or establish competitive advantage which we believe will prove increasingly important to investment performance whereas the carbon disclosure project institutional with assets of more than trillion under management to disclose their greenhouse gas and climate related in currently does not respond to the questionnaire whereas and global have to the apple and target corp the publicly as being among the and global with market capitalization that do not respond to the climate change survey whereas such as apple disclose information regarding the environmental footprint greenhouse gas of major electronic currently no such information regarding the kindle self by the company as its best

compensation compensation discussion and analysis our approach to compensating our executive is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price executive are our chief executive officer chief financial officer and other three most highly executive based on sec our executive are employed on an at will basis and executive officer compensation generally of stock based compensation base hire cash and other compensation and consistent with this approach we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or single trigger change in control for our executive stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis in the executive other than each received over of their total compensation in the form of equity due to substantial stock ownership approximately he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe

compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance and to our future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus the value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment received restricted stock unit award for in making
