board further that the leadership development and compensation committee which is made up of independent should maintain the ability to develop executive compensation and as it fit the board that it is appropriate for the leadership development and compensation committee to determine the performance against which are measured the executive compensation program currently in place as by the leadership development and compensation committee the long term of in how it our compensation program strong long term to our with our consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value the primary component of each executive total compensation is stock based as result we believe that the success of our substantial is already included in the long term view of shareholder value through our stock price and is already part of our executive compensation incentive structure and the board that making an explicit executive compensation performance measure is not necessary the board that you vote against this proposal regarding as an executive compensation performance measure item shareholder proposal regarding vote counting for shareholder investor voice queen avenue suite acting on behalf of beneficial owner of of common stock of the company notified us that it to present the following resolution at the annual meeting the board vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice resolved ask the board to take or initiate to amend company governing to provide that all non binding by shall be decided by simple majority of the cast for and against an item this policy would apply to all such unless have higher or applicable or stock exchange dictate otherwise supporting statement this proposal greater transparency clarity and understanding around how informed vote on shareholder in voting the meaning of abstain is defined by the dictionary as to formally decline to vote either for or against proposal or motion simple majority formula therefore cast for and against but not it the most democratic clear and accurate picture of the intent of who are both informed and decided while not in the formula the of who by definition have declined to express an opinion when choose to mark abstain whether they are confused disinterested or lack time to become fully informed it is apparent that their should be as neither for nor against an item in contrast unilaterally abstain as if against every shareholder proposal is it reasonable for to assert it the will of undecided and to artificially construe in favor of management often imply they have no choice but to use the default standard which however this nominal standard is not it is what to that do not choose simple majority voting research that the so default standard systematically bit ly voting research corporate secretary how it does this by depressing the appearance of support for shareholder the math is simple when elect to not express an opinion but then are as if they against proposal the tally is and management because they routinely oppose stockholder vote historically these have to describe numerous majority on shareholder as instead communication annual meeting offer the sole opportunity for most to communicate with counting as de against shareholder management how are and how the public support for shareholder in contrast to how shareholder are we see that director election where management from the appearance of strong support does not count thus management and shareholder do not receive equal treatment though the company complete discretion to cure such in its voting to avert like these the council of institutional declared should be only for of quorum therefore support accuracy fairness and good governance at by voting for simple majority vote counting on shareholder end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice recommendation of the board of on item the board of that you vote against this proposal the board regularly the corporate governance the for how are cast the board several to improve the governance proxy access and majority voting for the board does not however believe that the by the proposal represent necessary change to the governance our vote counting are consistent with law the vote counting methodology is consistent with law which to the company by virtue of its incorporation in that state section of the general corporation law as default that in all other than the election of the affirmative vote of the majority of present in person or by proxy at the meeting and to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the because that vote to abstain are present and to vote under this law standard any present at the meeting that abstain from voting are essentially as against the matter our vote counting are fair and consistent with of peer the vote counting methodology used by the company does not inherently favor by the board over by as the vote counting standard for any proposal other than for the election of is identical thus the company the same vote counting standard to its own advisory on executive compensation for example as it does to shareholder proposal in addition the vote counting methodology used by the company is the standard applied by majority of our incorporated in and according to study by by majority of our vote counting would not be in the best of the company all present in person or by proxy at our annual meeting are to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement the board that it is the responsibility of any person proposal forward for to of whether the company or shareholder persuade majority of the that vote to support the proposal reflect the fact that shareholder and proposal but not been persuaded to support the proposal further are clearly told the effect of an vote as opposed to who abstain as the proposal would do we believe it appropriate to count as present at the annual meeting and to vote and thus as relevant in whether majority of the present have in favor of proposal the effect of the vote counting methodology to completely remove from the of vote would be to disenfranchise those who chose to abstain from voting it would remove one of the three as vote to abstain itself is position taken by shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the board our vote counting is not necessary the manner in which are in shareholder would not have been determinative in any of the on by the since the company went public in over that time if the vote counting methodology had been used it would never have the voting for proposal by more than and would never have in different outcome in of whether proposal or to pass the vote counting methodology is both consistent with law and fair to the board that it is important to recognize the of all those who choose to abstain from voting on particular proposal therefore the board does not believe that the vote counting methodology is in the best of the company the board that you vote against this proposal regarding vote counting for shareholder beneficial ownership of the following table forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of except as otherwise by each person or entity known by us to beneficially own more than of our common stock each director each executive officer for whom compensation information is given in the summary compensation table in this proxy statement and all and executive as group except as otherwise and subject to any of the spouse we believe that the beneficial of common stock listed below based on information furnished by such have sole voting and investment power with respect to such as of we had of common stock outstanding name and address of beneficial owner amount terry avenue north wa the vanguard group vanguard pa seely brown ryder all and executive as group less than as of based on information provided in schedule the vanguard group sole voting power with respect to of the voting power with respect to of the sole investment power with respect to of the and investment power with respect to of the by charitable trust of which is trustee and as to which he voting and investment power beneficial ownership of such as to which or may be to share voting and investment power beneficial ownership of such as to which or may be to share voting and investment power beneficial ownership of such beneficially by other executive not individually listed in the table executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the letter to we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as result we may make and weigh differently than some for example under our compensation philosophy we have stock based compensation that over an extended period of time in addition we believe stock based compensation to at all across the company in customer centric people who think and act like because they are our compensation philosophy for our executive in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our and is by the following first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program strong long term to our with our third our compensation program performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as basis for compensation as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program and our core customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like and thinking long term high bar and frugality for our executive who are employed on an at will basis we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or change in control for our executive additionally except as noted below for rule we do not provide cash or equity tied to performance criteria which could cause to focus solely on short term at the expense of long term growth and innovation we believe that in the creation of long term value without the use of performance or specific indices is optimal for particularly at the executive level and for we believe that the best measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term to help our with long term value creation we compensate our with restricted stock unit that have long vesting over time will have multiple restricted stock unit that vest over many and thus provide greater amount of potential compensation in later than the current year this to seek out develop and pursue that focus on serving our and reflect long term view for thinking about our holistically and to across the company as company that relentlessly invention across wide range of we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize few discrete or short term financial or operational performance that may narrowly focus our on the success of only isolated instead of on the long term success of the company as whole for example in we could have adopted performance appropriate for an bookseller but those performance may have our from their time and energy into that later kindle and other of long term focus include the development of our third party seller business which was by the learned from our unsuccessful to build an and when we experimented with other than fast shipping to our prime membership program performance goal some level of success by measure but to have culture that relentlessly invention we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition we do not know in advance whether it will work in addition given the unique nature of and our many standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to serve as relevant for performance for example if we had tied compensation to our performance relative to retail index we might never have our business since would have been for making the early in cloud technology and infrastructure that similarly if we tied compensation to our performance relative to technology index we might not have built our own our own and or shipping and delivery index in business profile at point in time and may deter from considering or that do not fit into that mold thus we think the best stock market comparison we can make is measuring our own success can we continue to grow our share value over the long term as result we believe the best performance measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term therefore when we set our target compensation we assume fixed annual increase in the stock price currently so that our will be directly impacted if our stock price is flat or this approach worked well over the past three as our stock price approximately between and base consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base for executive are designed to provide minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those to senior leadership at similarly situated base ranged from for to for messrs and due to substantial ownership in again not to receive additional compensation in and never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over period of executive may not necessarily receive stock based every year for example because annual total compensation as in the summary compensation table below the entire fair value as of the grant date of stock award in that year without regard to the fact that the grant over number of executive total compensation as will be higher in in which he or she grant to in which he or she does not receive grant due to substantial stock ownership he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock the long term of executive and and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock restricted stock unit grant and vesting for executive whether for hire or subsequent are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the senior vice president of human and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit generally vest over period of five or six vesting does not accelerate as result of termination of employment or upon change in control unless the leadership development and compensation committee that the company will not be assuming or substituting the for hire and made in connection with internal the senior vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of past compensation from the executive former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior at the executive level of responsibility and to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology for periodic the senior vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance our core and to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the senior vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price appreciation taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the senior vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment as received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill as chief financial officer his performance in the year preceding the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in the business development his sustained

the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in consumer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future in setting these the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of equity as well as information from third party compensation data for retail technology and media alphabet apple best buy cisco general electric oracle target mart and the walt company the leadership development and compensation committee discretion in executive compensation and does not require that compensation be set at specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data in addition messrs and each received an additional restricted stock unit award for which vest in in in and in in connection with being web and consumer respectively these were designed to encourage long term retention and were given in recognition of their level of responsibility and contribution to our future success over the long term the total number of restricted stock to our executive during only of the total number of restricted stock to all during and of the weighted average number of outstanding for the total number of restricted stock to our executive during the three year period from to only of the total number of restricted stock to all during the same three year period and of the weighted average number of outstanding for the same three year period at the time of grant we impose additional vesting on certain stock based to executive so that the may qualify as tax deductible compensation under section of the internal revenue code however the company or the leadership development and compensation committee may grant that do not qualify for tax under section and there is no guarantee that intended to qualify for tax under section will ultimately be as so by the internal revenue service hire cash none of the executive received hire cash bonus in other compensation and executive receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical relocation and other generally available to all of our we provide security for security in addition to that provided at business and during business related travel we believe that all company security are reasonable and necessary and for the benefit and that the amount of the security is especially reasonable in light of low salary and the fact that he never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically the amount and nature of security
