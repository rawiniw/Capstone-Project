was million and million during and the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreign currency gains on intercompany income our tax provision or benefit from income for interim is determined an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in in foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax

accordance with and free cash flow should not be upon to the exclusion of financial free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash since of property and equipment internal use and development are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of debt related to capital and for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash table of contents the following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure net cash provided by used in operating for the trailing twelve ended march and in millions net cash provided by used in operating of property and equipment internal use and development free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating
