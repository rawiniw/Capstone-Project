proper way this transparency the electorate to make informed and give proper weight to different and in transparency and accountability expose to and business that could threaten long term shareholder value political spending statement on its that some aggregate spent on government but we believe it is too unspecific and to be meaningful publicly available data does not provide complete picture of

corporate accountability and disclosure which the in the scoring just out of this proposal simply the company to disclose its political spending to trade and other tax exempt used for political this would bring in line with growing number of leading and that both support political disclosure and accountability and present the information on their board and its need comprehensive disclosure to be

political to and by the pac are to be disclosed these are publicly available on the at disclosure we do not believe that an additional ad report as in the proposal would be an effective and prudent use of our time and the board that you vote against this proposal regarding report concerning corporate political beneficial ownership of the following table forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of except as otherwise by each person or entity known by us to beneficially own more than of our common stock each director each executive officer for whom compensation information is given in the summary compensation table in this proxy statement and all and executive as group except as otherwise and subject to any of the spouse we believe that the beneficial of common stock listed below based on information furnished by such have sole voting and investment power with respect to such as of we had of common stock outstanding name and address of beneficial owner amount terry avenue north wa capital world south hope street ca seely brown ryder all and executive as group less than as of based on information provided in schedule capital world sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the and no voting or investment power with respect to the for of the of the exchange act of capital world is to be the beneficial owner of such however it expressly that it is in fact the beneficial owner of such by charitable trust of which is trustee and as to which he voting and investment power beneficial ownership of the of common stock by the charitable trust issuable under stock based award that as to which or may be to share voting and investment power beneficially by other executive not individually listed in the table and as to which one of the other executive may be to share voting and investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis our approach to compensating our executive is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price executive are our chief executive officer chief financial officer and other three most highly executive based on sec our executive are employed on an at will basis and executive officer compensation generally of stock based compensation base hire cash and other compensation and consistent with this approach we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or single trigger change in control for our executive stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over period of executive may not necessarily receive stock based every year depending on stock price performance as result executive officer total compensation as in our proxy statement may vary significantly from year to year due to substantial stock ownership approximately he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock the long term of executive and and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock restricted stock unit grant and vesting for executive whether for hire or subsequent are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the vice president of human and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit generally vest over period of six for hire the vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of past compensation from the executive former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be upon joining the compensation of similarly situated senior at the executive level of responsibility and to our future success and the market compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology for periodic the vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance and to our future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill as chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in web and cloud his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in international consumer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in north consumer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future in setting these the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of equity as well as information from third party compensation data for retail and technology apple best buy cisco dell intuit oracle target and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee discretion in executive compensation and does not require that compensation be set at specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data we have additional vesting designed to qualify stock based in previous to executive as tax deductible compensation under section of the internal revenue code however the company or the leadership development and compensation committee may grant that do not qualify for tax under section and there is no guarantee that intended to qualify for tax under section will ultimately be as so by the internal revenue service base consistent with our belief that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base for executive are designed to provide minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those by similarly situated base ranged from for to for due to substantial ownership in again not to receive additional compensation in and never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount hire cash hire cash generally are in monthly to executive officer these are also determined by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the chief executive officer and the vice president of human in the amount of hire cash the leadership development and compensation committee the same as above with respect to hire restricted stock unit the hire cash are for set amount determined at hire and are generally designed to provide appropriate total compensation until stock based begin to vest at which time total compensation becomes variable and largely tied to long term shareholder value none of the executive received hire cash in other compensation and executive receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical relocation and other generally available to all of our we provide security for security in addition to that provided at business and during business related travel we believe that all company security are reasonable and necessary and for the benefit and we believe that the amount of the security is especially reasonable in light of low salary and the fact that he never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically the amount and nature of security reportable security along with expatriation cost of living and housing allowance are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other or other personal to our executive shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation at our annual meeting of our on an advisory basis the compensation of our executive as disclosed in our proxy statement and frequency of

executive compensation program the leadership development and compensation committee did not implement to our executive compensation program as result of the shareholder advisory vote based on the underlying the recommendation regarding the frequency of future advisory executive compensation and the vote of on the matter adopted triennial shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and accordingly the next such shareholder advisory vote will occur at our annual meeting of leadership development and compensation committee report the leadership development and compensation committee
