your comment is set forth below by our response to consolidated financial description of business and accounting and content page we have your response to comment you state of our relentless focus on innovation we do not believe that separate disclosure of the associated with of the type set forth in would be material to an understanding of the business you also state believe that providing metric that is narrowly defined by the set forth in and not used by management because it is considered to be incomplete would fail to meet the objective of being useful information in the context of our please address the following whether research and development as defined in are quantitatively material and if so why research and development are not material from qualitative perspective given that have some future benefit not characteristic of typical expense whether you are able to reasonably identify or estimate research and development if you are unable to identify or estimate research and development please explain in detail the for your inability whether you are able to separately quantify technology from content and whether technology or content the majority of type research and development and if not the for your answer in this regard please supplementally provide description of the of technology and content please tailor your description for the uninitiated page whether you are able to discuss the in each of the research and development other technology and content of technology and content in discussion and analysis of of lastly if we believe that you should clearly disclose that you are unable to capture research and development as set forth in the for your inability response we continuously seek to invent on behalf of our and to improve their experience through to our to and and development of product and service through web or these innovation are largely directed at the customer experience what we refer to as to delight the customer as such they are designed not only to provide for rewarding experience when interact with us currently but also to enhance customer loyalty and generate future in addition these innovation encompass of at any one point in time as we noted in prior comment response the volume and diversity of these is best in the section of our quarterly earnings which are attached as to our item form in these we list many of our that were during the quarter typically multiple product and service and customer because our business model the simultaneous research design development and maintenance of both and and any dividing line between those in and would be imprecise and inconsistent with our approach to innovation moreover we believe that disclosure of only those of set forth in would underrepresent the level of we are making on behalf of our this is because our routinely work concurrently on multiple that could be defined as research and development in nature and also on more routine ongoing to refine enrich or otherwise improve our and after we introduce product or service we routinely work to further develop and enhance that product or service often doubling down spending more time and in response to our to refine enhance and expand that particular product or service this approach to our innovation is frequently and routinely repeated across our from our and prime service to our functionality to our content and other for example our are constantly working to build and simultaneously refining and enriching to comprehend and implement voice and these fall on continuum of those in and whatever we spent to formulate test and design would be less than the effort and cost we have devoted and are to devote to refine enrich and otherwise improve on nevertheless as result of these is clearly different offering than it was when it was first in this and countless other the between and do not meaningfully reflect the nature and range of that we undertake to invent for our the foregoing have led us to conclude that the narrowly defined by are not material because they would not provide with information that would consider important to an investment decision or change the total mix of information in this conclusion for example in our fourth quarter earnings release our chief executive officer stated that based on the success of the company to double down on it see exhibit to our form on page in response to your comment we with our investor department whether traditional research and development within the scope of would be meaningful or useful for and we also our earnings call for the past three to see whether ask about research and development within the scope of these and review that such are not material for two first as above because of the range of innovation we undertake to support the of millions of different and that we offer aggregate research and development cost data would not indicate any particular area of activity and would not reveal with regard to development that are material to an understanding of our business second we believe that distinguishing between attributable to of the type in and those attributable to in would be and misleading to as the resulting would not fairly present the we make in order to offer wide variety of and to our these are by the fact that during the past three we received only one question regarding research and development during our earnings notably on that one occasion the question reflected an incorrect assumption that research and development would trail off and eventually lead to higher operating thus this question does not accurately reflect the fact that we continue to make significant in and that go beyond what would be as research and development under finally as we have previously we also do not manage our personnel or in manner that between that would fall within versus so the distinction also would not provide with into how we view our we have disclosed in our annual report on form for the year ending and in prior the principal of technology and content specifically the of the included in technology and content primarily include payroll and related associated with technical responsible for expanding our and and to introduce and and infrastructure which depreciation of equipment necessary to support and our innovation other are immaterial and include overhead type insurance professional we also have material in the of our technology and content for example in the discussion and analysis section of our annual report on form for the year ending we state that the increase in technology and content in absolute in and to the comparable prior year is primarily due to payroll and related associated with technical responsible for expanding our and and to introduce and service and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure there are currently no identifiable within the other of our technology and content that would be material to an understanding of our innovation for the foregoing we believe that trying to separate innovation that fall on continuum of those in and is not useful exercise for our in considering the level of spending we have made or will make on behalf of our we also believe specifically the only analyst question regarding during the past three arose with respect to our first quarter when an analyst second question on as you look at like are they still growing significantly in other is there room for significant expansion at some point in the future when is don know three five or ten its current or do you expect to scale up at the same rate as page any methodology to identify and allocate associated with our innovation among these discrete of would require such subjective that the resulting information would lack relevance and in our view the resulting disclosure of only those associated with would be misleading and to we similarly believe that it would not be useful to provide an explanation in our filings as to why we do not disclose that could be as since such are not material we respectfully believe as well that it is not common and therefore could confuse to provide disclosure on why immaterial information is not in filings if you have any or further please contact me by at or by phone at very truly yours president accounting branch of corporation staff of
