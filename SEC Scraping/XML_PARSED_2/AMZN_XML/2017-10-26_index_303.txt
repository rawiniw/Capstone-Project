inherently unpredictable subject to significant and could be material to our operating and cash for particular period in addition for disclosed above that do not which loss is probable or reasonably possible an estimate of the amount of loss or range of such an not is immaterial and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of that could potentially result from the application of non monetary for each of the disclosed as loss contingency in our either we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss or the high end of the range was not material in each case in excess of if any as reflected in our most of the loss we disclose involve patent among the affecting our assessment of these are that the are in early and the often lack specificity for the non patent affecting our assessment include that the involve novel of liability and the may claim to represent class of indeterminate while many of the we disclose are at early we reassess our loss exposure at least quarterly and in the event we conclude loss is both probable and estimable we accrue such amount at such we also assess whether we can estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of any while we have that we are not able to estimate such for the above or that any estimable in excess of are not material we will in the future disclose such amount if estimable and material
