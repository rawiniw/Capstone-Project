two year time more than half our have more than ten one is split between four rather than independent we need dependent on and accountable to the who elect them proxy access in the united the sec rule at found proxy access the potential to enhance board performance and raise overall us market capitalization by between billion and billion none of the event indicate that proxy access reform will hinder board performance proxy access would serve as useful tool for in the united and would ultimately benefit both the and corporate the council of institutional whose have trillion the following

proposal and statement of support by recommendation of the board of on item over the past six the board and will continue to monitor on proxy access in addition the company will continue to discuss proxy access with its as part of its regular shareholder engagement program over the coming year however at this time the board of that this proposal is not in the best of and that you vote against this proposal for the following the and corporate governance committee an active board refreshment program to nominate independent who are responsive to are free of with our and possess the right industry and leadership to represent all and guide our continued success the company adopted numerous corporate governance to reinforce the accountability to the board the specific of this proposal as problematic and out of line with proxy access and while the board and will continue to study proxy access proxy access remains rare among the with which the company for board talent and never actually been used and the board the most immediate effect of proxy access would be to discourage qualified from agreeing to serve on the board the and corporate governance committee an active board refreshment program the board actively and its membership over the last seven the board had an average of eight independent and added five and had three depart the fully independent and corporate governance committee annually both the board and each individual director and in making on the composition the tenure performance experience skill set and commitment of each director in addition our annually evaluate both their own and one performance through formal board committee and individual director evaluation we discuss under director on page the process that the and corporate governance committee goes through in the and of candidate for the board these include commitment to the long term of the customer experience savvy leadership ability personal and professional ethics and business and professional experience in such as technology finance accounting product development intellectual property law entertainment and marketing other that affect the and corporate governance selection of director are the absence of through with significant or with the wide range of against which we compete as result of these have been added to the board as the have and diversified while we have also with deep understanding of the rapid growth and past by all of these the and corporate governance committee board of highly successful innovative and independent who effectively oversee management and and have our company to the long term success and benefit of our the long term consistently the composite higher in the past three five and ten year additionally year to date is substantially the our corporate governance reinforce the alignment with and accountability to in to recommend that you vote against this proxy access proposal the board also took into account the following corporate governance at the company that already serve to promote responsiveness to all are annually in uncontested are only if they receive majority of the cast and are subject to our resignation policy under sec and state law already have the power to directly nominate and solicit for their own director at shareholder without to navigate any additional ownership or satisfy year holding period see page the independent elect an independent lead director for two year term our annually evaluate both their own and one performance through formal board committee and individual director evaluation to enhance their alignment with the of our long term our independent compensation solely of periodic stock unit that vest over three year period and the th percentile of director compensation of peer group our executive are primarily through stock based compensation that over an extended period of time and our chief executive officer minimal annual compensation and no equity compensation in light of his substantial ownership in may call special at which they can nominate director or propose other business may submit of potential director directly to the board for consideration see page and in addition to our annual shareholder engagement process are able to communicate with the board in the manner in our on significant corporate governance because we maintain an open director nomination process accessible to all as above and historically our have consistently our nominated by our board and not advanced opposing we do not believe that proxy access as an additional director nomination mechanism is warranted in addition to these governance which promote responsiveness to shareholder the board strong record of being active and engaged and building long term shareholder value the board is fully open to considering shareholder and potential and the company regularly the of its major on governance proxy access and will continue to do so the already have an effective voice in director selection election and accountability and have consistently and overwhelmingly our director the specific of this proposal are problematic the process in the proposal significant break from the traditional director election process under which director nominated by who hold fiduciary to all are included in the proxy proxy of the type by the proposal would be highly disruptive and could deter qualified from board service as result in addition to believing that proxy access generally is designed to address that do not exist at our company the board that this proposal is problematic because it prescriptive that are out of line with proxy access and many of the protective that were in the proxy access rule rule for example the proposal does not provide that proxy access will not be subject to abuse by seeking to take control of the board although seeking to use the rule would have been to certify that they were not holding any of with the purpose or with the effect of control of the registrant that rule was struck down and this proposal instead that proxy access be made available to the extent by law thus this proposal significantly from other proxy access shareholder that specifically require to certify that they are not seeking to effect change in control of the company proxy access is intended to give an opportunity to have their for election included in the proxy it should not be mechanism for change in control of the company unlike the rule the proposal the company to list all alphabetically by the presentation in its proxy of selected by the board through the exercise of their fiduciary would be with who may have specific agenda on behalf of one or few thereby needless confusion for regarding the distinction between the proposal is as nomination process and would require the company to include any in the proxy statement regardless of whether the intend to file their own proxy statement and run proxy contest in contrast rule shareholder to elect to utilize the proxy access process and did not require company to include the in the proxy statement if the otherwise were soliciting for election of their the proposal does not require shareholder to be independent or to satisfy applicable law and in particular to require that shareholder have no with competitor rule provided that proxy access should be limited to that meet objective independence and satisfy all applicable legal the burden of engaging in proxy contest against director candidate who if could cause the company to be out of compliance with applicable independence and to violate the law could ultimately harm the proposal does not require to have and retain voting and investment power of the used to establish eligibility to nominate director under the proposal shareholder could have net short position in the stock and still be to make nomination rule provided that proxy access would only be available to that possessed ultimate ownership over the the proposal does not require to retain ownership of their through the meeting shareholder could sell all of its prior to the meeting date which would the of the shareholder and company rule shareholder to hold the through the meeting date in addition the proposal does not cap the number of group for of the threshold which could allow of special interest to act together and administratively burden the company and also does not require the to assume liability stemming from any legal or regulatory violation out of their nomination of director or their in support of their director the board that the failure of the proposal to provide the foregoing against abuse of the proxy access process the proposal out of line with proxy access and could result in proxy access being or in manner that would be harmful to our implementation of proxy access on these also could increase pressure on the board and management to take short term perspective to company and that would not be in the long term of our proxy access is rare and could discourage qualified from agreeing to serve on the board the board that any decision to implement proxy access should be made in careful and deliberative manner only after that it will enhance shareholder value among with which for director talent proxy access remains rarity moreover many of the that have proxy access to date have been with governance or operational consistent with that focus recent initiative by one large institutional investor to promote adoption of proxy access been directed at where there is lack of board diversity or other governance or operational given the absence of these of at the company the strong corporate governance engagement with and track record of building significant long term value the board that with respect to the company proxy access is not necessary even among those few public that provide for proxy access to date no director candidate ever been nominated by pursuant to proxy access process thus the board that proxy access is neither appropriate nor at the company the and corporate governance committee which significant amount of time searching for and director that the most immediate impact of proxy access would be to discourage talented and innovative from agreeing to serve on the board the board that the ability to elect is one of most fundamental the corporate

beneficially own more than of our common stock each director each executive officer for whom compensation information is given in the summary compensation table in this proxy statement and all and executive as group except as otherwise and subject to any of the spouse we believe that the beneficial of common stock listed below based on information furnished by such have sole voting and investment power with respect to such as of we had of common stock outstanding name and address of beneficial owner amount terry avenue north wa capital world south hope street ca seely brown ryder all and executive as group less than as of based on information provided in schedule capital world division of capital research and management company sole voting and investment power with respect to

be to share voting and investment power beneficial ownership of such beneficially by other executive not individually listed in the table and as to which one of the other executive may be to share voting and investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the letter to we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as result we may make and weigh differently than some for example under our compensation philosophy we have stock based compensation that over an extended period of time in addition we believe stock based compensation to at all across the company in customer centric people who think and act like because they are our compensation philosophy for our executive in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our and is by the following first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program strong long term to our with our third our compensation program performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as basis for compensation as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program and our core customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like and thinking long term high bar and frugality for our executive who are employed on an at will basis we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or change in control for our executive except as noted below we do not provide cash or equity tied to performance criteria which could cause to focus solely on short term at the expense of long term growth and innovation base consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base for executive are designed to provide minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those to senior leadership at similarly situated base ranged from for to for due to substantial ownership in again not to receive additional compensation in and never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over period of executive may not necessarily receive stock based every year for example because annual total compensation the entire fair value as of the grant date of stock award in that year without regard to the fact that the grant over number of executive total compensation will be higher in in which he or she grant to in which he or she does not receive grant due to substantial stock ownership he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock the long term of executive and and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock restricted stock unit grant and vesting for executive whether for hire or subsequent are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the vice president of human and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit generally vest over period of six vesting

leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of past compensation from the executive former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior at the executive level of responsibility and to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology for periodic the vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance our core and to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price appreciation taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment received restricted stock unit award for in after the leadership development and compensation committee had made this grant his
