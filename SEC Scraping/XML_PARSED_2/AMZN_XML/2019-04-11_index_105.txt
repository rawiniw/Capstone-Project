that it is important for to have the ability to call special shareholder too low of threshold could expose to the risk of special being by few on narrow or short term rather than the long term best of the company and generally for example event driven hedge funds could use special to disrupt our business or to facilitate self serving short term financial even if they are ultimately not able to obtain support from majority of those who might seek to call special meeting could subject us to considerable expense distract management and the board from important business or seek self interested in exchange for special meeting perhaps this is the reason why as of majority of the fortune by net that allow to call special shareholder have set threshold higher than that by the proponent by

perspective in addition the board flexibility in board leadership structure is more suitable for us than rigid and prescriptive approach instead this proposal if would require the board to immediately

adequate for to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female across race and base bonus and equity compensation end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of on item we believe that people should receive equal pay for equal work regardless of gender or race and are to compensating our fairly and equitably since at least on key providing information on its gender pay gap on an annual basis the gender pay statistics demonstrate that its comparably when the work of people the same when compensation in the our data that for every dollar that men the same and for every dollar that white the same we also are strongly to increasing gender and racial diversity among our leadership as disclosed on our diversity we are to invest in our to bring more and into leadership at have an executive recruiting team on more diverse talent participate in and with and have several to develop diverse into more senior an unadjusted global median wage gap statistic annually would not advance our deep commitment to equal pay for equal work an unadjusted global median pay statistic does not account for in pay across such as cost of living job function level labor force participation country currency geography and other that impact in compensation on global basis we believe that the global pay gap information that we review and disclose publicly each year which these more accurate picture of our global pay and as reflected by our pay information we are to fairly and equitably compensating our our compensation and are designed to ensure that are in accordance with their and level without regard to gender or race we ensure that our and are consistently in accordance with the law by annually employee compensation along with providing equitable compensation we are deeply to an environment where all can be successful and thrive here too the demonstrate that to make progress year over year with more than we have the percentage of and racial ethnic across our tech and non tech corporate over the past three our commitment to diversity and inclusion is further by our ten

independently on the human corporate equality index the equity inclusion and empowerment index the disability equality index and by the foundation for the blind achievement award more information about diversity and inclusion and employee is publicly available at diversity given our attention on equal pay through its and as reflected by its pay statistics the board that vote against this proposal the board that you vote against this proposal to the gender pay item shareholder proposal report on certain metrics into executive compensation beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support whereas suggest that that integrate environmental social and governance into business strategy reduce legal and regulatory and improve long term performance leading group of metrics into executive pay incentive among them and guidance from the un for responsible investment that in executive incentive can help protect long term shareholder value diversity inclusion and equity are key of business and success research that in the for gender and racial ethnic diversity were more likely to have above average financial diversity company in catalyst report diversity was positively associated with more revenue and greater relative yet technology have not this opportunity people of color hold just percent of technical in the sector hold percent of entry level tech and just percent of suite in the workplace the tech diversity crisis for talent acquisition and retention product development and customer service these human capital are out at in the rev that board is still all white it does not represent talent and opportunity that among the major tech struggling with diversity and inclusion is one of the bigger rare chance to get more diverse fast taken to address diversity however are mounting as remains predominantly white and male especially in leadership among in according to the most recent report made available just percent were and only one executive was an person of color according to the above report the people who report directly to chief executive officer jeff all are white and only one is woman seek clarity regarding how improvement and how that strategy is by executive accountability clearly disclosed comprehensive links among diversity and executive compensation would enhance approach such as and have already set diversity and begun linking of compensation to such should consider to keep pace with and to strengthen human capital management resolved request the board compensation committee prepare report the feasibility of metrics metrics regarding diversity among senior into performance or vesting that may apply to senior under the compensation or for the of this proposal is defined as how environmental and social and related financial are into long term corporate strategy and diversity to gender racial and ethnic diversity end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of on item we believe strongly in environmental social and governance into our business strategy and have many as on our at for example we have an extensive project over the past several to develop an advanced scientific model to carefully map our carbon footprint to provide our business with detailed information helping them identify ways to reduce carbon use in their an additional example of our commitment to is our project shipment zero which is our vision to make all net zero carbon with of all net zero by to track our progress on this journey and as part of an overall commitment to our we plan to share company wide carbon footprint along with related and later in as part of shipment zero we will continue to use our scale and the feedback share with us to enable and encourage up and down our supply chain to reduce their own environmental impact just as weve done with like ship in own container and frustration free similarly we take seriously our commitment to diversity and respect for diverse gender race religion sexual orientation disability and other of diversity which are enduring for us as reflected in number of our as on our diversity at at diversity we believe that the pursuit of and diversity can enhance long term shareholder value see shipment zero vision for net zero carbon see an icon we likewise have established our executive compensation program to support long term shareholder value and therefore believe that we already are effectively the of this proposal the primary component of senior total compensation at is stock based compensation while it would be possible to integrate performance metrics metrics into the vesting that apply to under our compensation we believe that our executive compensation tightly senior executive compensation with long term success as result we are not in favor of performance in general and we note that our have consistently our executive compensation program the lack of performance in prior with over in favor because we believe that and diversity also support long term value we believe our executive compensation already address the of this proposal for the foregoing the board therefore that vote against this proposal the board that you vote against this proposal report on certain metrics into executive compensation item shareholder proposal regarding vote counting for shareholder beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support unequal voting at whereas many employ poor governance practice that unwarranted power to disregard investor this as formula more than shareholder that winning or greater simple majority vote to instead be as failing the key is how abstain are for example plum creek timber proposal on political spending simple majority vote of percent however the use of formula swapping the vote by percent and the outcome to failing percent formula swapping abstain into the formula against shareholder voter intent formula swapping mathematically every abstention into an against vote reducing the percentage cast in favor these distorted are then by the press and often become in company sec filings in this kind of formula swapping favorable simple majority vote counting formula for board but more repressive formula to count on shareholder the inconsistent treatment of these management versus shareholder disproportionately board vote while depressing the tally on shareholder this poor swapping at disadvantage and the faulty logic that company can judge voter intent how did this come to be under rule the sec use of fair simple majority standard for divided by for against to determine resubmission are barred from this sec formula other than this state law typically and the sec can not direct how count historically competition for corporate in race to the in which permitted to adopt inconsistent and discriminatory voting that continue to disadvantage to this day policy of the council of institutional the voice of corporate governance that should be only for of quorum emphasis added accordingly please vote for this common sense proposal that the systemic of instead level field where does not count its board proposal more leniently than shareholder resolved ask the board of to take to amend company governing to provide that all non binding by shall be decided by simple majority of the cast for and against an item this policy would apply to all such unless have higher or applicable or stock exchange dictate otherwise end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of on item the board regularly our corporate governance the for how are cast the board several to improve our governance proxy access and majority voting for the board does not however believe that the by the proposal represent necessary change to our governance this vote counting proposal at our annual meeting of with approximately of the present at the meeting did not support such proposal and our annual meeting of with approximately of the present at the meeting did not support such proposal use of the vote counting methodology would not have such our vote counting methodology is consistent with law which to by virtue of its incorporation in that state section of the general corporation law as default that in all other than the election of the affirmative vote of the majority of present in person or by proxy at the meeting and to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the because that vote to abstain are present and to vote under this law standard any present at the meeting that abstain from voting are essentially as against the matter our vote counting are fair and consistent with of peer the vote counting methodology we use does not inherently favor by the board over by as the vote counting standard for any proposal other than for the election of is identical thus we apply the same vote counting standard to our own advisory on executive compensation for example as we do to shareholder proposal in addition the vote counting methodology we use is the standard applied by majority of our incorporated in and according to study by by majority of the board that our vote counting would not be in the best of our all present in person or by proxy at our annual meeting are to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement the board that it is the responsibility of anyone proposal forward for to of whether or shareholder persuade majority of the that vote to support the proposal reflect the fact that shareholder and proposal but not been persuaded to support the proposal further are clearly told the effect of an vote as opposed to who abstain we believe it appropriate to count as present at the annual meeting and to vote and thus as relevant in whether majority of the present have in favor of proposal the effect of our vote counting methodology to completely remove from the of vote would be to disenfranchise those who chose to abstain from voting it would remove one of the three as vote to abstain itself is position taken by shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the board the manner in which are in shareholder would not have been determinative in any of the on by our since we went public in over that time if the vote counting methodology had been used it would never have the voting for proposal by more than and would never have in different outcome in of whether proposal or our vote counting methodology is both consistent with law and fair to the board that it is important to recognize the of all those who choose to abstain from voting on particular proposal therefore the board that vote against this proposal the board that you vote against this proposal regarding vote counting for shareholder beneficial ownership of the following table forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of except as otherwise by each person or entity known by us to

individually listed in the table executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the letter to we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as result we may make and weigh differently than some for example under our compensation philosophy we have stock based compensation that over an extended period of time in addition we believe stock based compensation to in customer centric people who think and act like because they are our compensation philosophy for our executive in the summary compensation table below is generally the same as for all of our who receive equity compensation and is by the following first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program strong long term to our with our third our compensation program performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as basis for compensation as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program and our core customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like and thinking long term high bar and frugality for our executive who are employed on an at will basis we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or change in control for our executive additionally except as noted below in certain we do not provide cash or equity tied to performance criteria which could cause to focus solely on short term at the expense of long term growth and innovation we believe that in the creation of long term value without the use of performance or specific indices is optimal for particularly at the executive level and for we believe that the best measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term to help our with long term value creation we compensate them with restricted stock unit that have long vesting over time will have multiple restricted stock unit that vest over many and thus provide greater amount of potential compensation in later than the current year this them to seek out develop and pursue that focus on serving our and reflect long term view for thinking about our holistically and to across the company because of our low the absence of an annual bonus program and reliance on restricted stock with long vesting we believe that our compensation is tightly with our long term and therefore that performance on our stock are neither necessary nor given the nature of our business appropriate as company that relentlessly invention across wide range of we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize few discrete or short term financial or operational performance that may narrowly focus our on the success of only isolated instead of on the long term success of the company as whole for example in we could have adopted performance appropriate for an bookseller but those performance may have our from their time and energy into that later kindle and other of long term focus include the development of our third party seller business which was by the learned from our unsuccessful to build an and when we experimented with other than fast shipping to our prime membership program performance goal some level of success by measure but to have culture that relentlessly invention we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition we do not know in advance whether it will work in addition given the unique nature of and our many standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to serve as relevant for performance for example if we had tied compensation to our performance relative to retail index we might never have our business since would have been for making the early in cloud technology and infrastructure that similarly if we tied compensation to our performance relative to technology index we might not have built our own our own and or shipping and delivery index in business profile at point in time and may deter from considering or that do not fit into that mold thus we think the best stock market comparison we can make is measuring our own success can we continue to grow our share value over the long term as result we believe the best performance measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term therefore when we set our target compensation we assume fixed annual increase in the stock price so that our compensation will be negatively impacted if our stock price is flat or and is favorably impacted if the stock beyond the initial stock price assumption this approach our and well over the past three as our stock price approximately between and base consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base for executive are designed to provide minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those to senior leadership at similarly situated base ranged from for to for messrs and due to substantial ownership in not to receive additional compensation and never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over period of executive may not necessarily receive stock based every year for example because annual total compensation as in the summary compensation table below the entire fair value as of the grant date of stock award in that year without regard to the fact that the grant over number of executive total compensation as will be higher in in which he or she grant to in which he or she does not receive grant due to substantial stock ownership he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock the long term of executive and and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock restricted stock unit grant and vesting for executive whether for hire or subsequent are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the senior vice president of human and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit generally vest over period of five or six vesting does not accelerate as result of termination of employment or upon change in control unless the leadership development and compensation committee that the company will not be assuming or substituting the for hire and made in connection with internal the senior vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of past compensation from the executive former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior at the executive level of responsibility and to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology for periodic the senior vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance our core and to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the senior vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price appreciation taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the senior vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may and messrs and received restricted stock unit with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment as received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill as chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above

the grant and his future received restricted stock unit award for in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the above with respect to periodic experience and skill in consumer his sustained performance over time in preceding the grant and his future in setting these the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of equity as well as information from third party compensation data for retail technology and media alphabet apple best buy cisco general electric oracle target and the walt company the leadership development and compensation committee discretion in executive compensation and does not require that compensation be set at specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data in addition messrs and each received an additional restricted stock unit award for which vest in in in and in these were given in recognition of these level of responsibility and contribution to our future success over the long term the total number of restricted stock to our executive during the three year period from to only of the total number of restricted stock to all during the same three year period and of the weighted average number of outstanding for the same three year period we impose additional vesting on certain stock based to executive for equity prior to tax law these were intended to qualify the stock based as tax deductible compensation under section of the internal revenue code however there is no guarantee that these will ultimately be as so by the internal revenue service as result of to the tax we expect that equity or other compensation provided under into or materially on or after generally will not be deductible to the extent they result in compensation to certain of our executive for or after that million in any one year for any such officer hire cash none of the executive received hire cash bonus in other compensation and executive receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical relocation and other generally available to all of our at we may provide security for and certain other executive security in addition to that provided at business and during business related travel we believe that all company security are reasonable and necessary and for the benefit the leadership development and compensation committee periodically the
