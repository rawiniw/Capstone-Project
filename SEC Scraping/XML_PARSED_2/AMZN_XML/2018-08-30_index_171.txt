exchange of corporation finance street re form for the fiscal year ended form for the quarterly period ended june and file no dear on behalf of this to your letter of august regarding our annual report on form for the year ended the and our quarterly report on form for the quarter ended june the each of your is set forth below by our response form for the fiscal year ended item discussion and analysis of financial condition and of page we note from in your current report on form on that you have million prime globally and that you shipped more than five billion in with prime in future periodic please disclose the percentage of net attributable to to prime versus to non prime response we respectfully do not believe that net attributable to prime versus to non prime is meaningful or useful information as an example growth or decline in net those attributable to prime may reflect customer of from third party since the same product sold through our for the same price can produce different and percent of net depending on whether it is sold by or by third party seller prime membership is primarily service designed to enhance overall customer experience and convenience promote customer loyalty and provide access to the many and that are available through our mobile and our physical which are all part of our distribution system as with our kindle and other and prime is only one element that our focus on selling wide range of and as august page result whether are associated with prime membership does not reflect on or provide useful information about the nature of our net and does not reflect how management the business there are number of additional that limit the significance or usefulness of information on the extent to which net are attributable to prime first in the percentage of net attributable to prime could reflect many disconnected from and unrelated to the prime program as an example this percentage would be impacted by net from and other net that are not associated with our prime program in addition utilization of prime member is not necessarily associated with activity in account for example prime member may purchase an item that is not prime eligible for which prime shipping are not available or may utilize prime benefit that does not result in us recording revenue such as free access to certain digital content or ad free on twitch in other the correlation between prime membership and our net may be difficult to assess such as when we provide prime early access to certain finally the ability of account to shift into and out of prime status also both the ability to define and the relevance of prime member net for example we provide monthly prime as well as promotional and trial and an account holder can choose whether to become prime member at any time and likewise can cancel membership on several days notice or allow prime membership to lapse during the year for the foregoing management does not track the percentage of net that are attributable to prime and therefore prime membership status is not tied into our financial as we further develop our distribution system it may become more difficult to associate net with prime membership accordingly we believe that the net information on our of similar and we now voluntarily report on quarterly basis the most useful insight into the nature and of our net in this disclosure our subscription category largely to prime we note that in as result of customer usage partially offset by we further note from your current report on form on that active by more than spurred by the broad adoption of to the extent in net are attributable to the adoption of such as please disclose as much in future periodic please refer to item of regulation letter to furnished as an exhibit to our current report on form stated that the number of active of machine learning not the total number of active of all by machine learning are just one of many innovative and by to its all of which we believe help attract and increase usage by however we did not identify material increase in net attributable to utilization of we hereby confirm to the staff that we will disclose in discussion and analysis any material in net attributable to or consistent with the of item form for the quarterly period ended june revenue page we note your disclosure on page that from certain digital media content is on net basis we also note your disclosure on page that digital media content is on gross basis please provide us with your analysis of how you determined whether you are acting as principal or as an agent in these please also revise your as appropriate reference through and august page of our digital media content are gross as the principal or net as the agent depending on whether our promise to the customer is to provide digital content or to facilitate sale by third party the nature of our promise on whether we control the content prior to transferring it as in and of the basis for to revenue from with principal versus agent when we control the content our promise is to provide access to it and revenue is gross when we do not control the content our promise is to facilitate the sale and revenue is net to distinguish promise to provide digital content from promise to facilitate the sale of digital content we consider the guidance about control in and the in we consider this guidance in conjunction with the in our with both digital content and for example when we promise access to library of digital content such as video or music we must have supplier in place that allow us to control distribution of the digital content in order to be able to fulfill our promise to make the digital content available to the customer often it is clear that we control the content because it is in our possession and we are able to set the of our promise to the customer for these we present revenue on gross basis conversely if we do not have possession of the digital content and are unable to set the of the promise to the customer our role is to facilitate the sale between the supplier and customer and we present revenue on net basis in some it is less clear as to whether we control the digital content or the of the customer promise in these we focus on the in when whether to record the revenue on gross or net basis in these we find that the which party is responsible for the promise and customer are often the as to which party the promise to the customer and we base our gross versus net decision on this assessment our reference to digital media content on page to our adoption of the revenue recognition standard on that page we that it was useful to qualitatively discuss some of the that impacted comparability which included limited number of digital media content where we net decision under and previously had revenue on gross basis digital media content that we record on net basis is included in third party seller in our net table as commission these have not been material and have not warranted specific reference in our on going disclosure we note your disclosure that revenue related to your third party seller and advertising is as the are please tell us and revise to clarify if revenue from these is over time or at point in time please also clarify your used to measure progress if applicable and why the reflect faithful depiction of the transfer of the reference and related to our third party seller our and advertising are either at point in time or over time depending on the nature of the contract with our customer revenue related to at point in time are when the related are provided for example to seller for sale to customer are when the sale is complete revenue related to provided over time are primarily output such as consumption or lapse of time which is the most representative measure of the value of the whether the entity the specific good or service before it is transferred to the customer is the basis for the nature of the promise august page transferred to the customer as in of the basis for of update for example related to storage are based on the quantity of storage over period of time our disclosure was intended to holistically address point in time and over time when we made reference to as the are however we appreciate the comment and will revise the disclosure as third party seller we offer that enable to sell their on our and their own branded and fulfill through us we are not the seller of record in these the and any related fulfillment and shipping we earn from these are are our include global of compute storage and other service revenue is to the provided based on stand alone selling and is when the are that are over time are measured primarily based on consumption or the lapse of time we pay in connection with that exceed one year are and over the contract term other other revenue primarily of advertising that when the are that are over time are
