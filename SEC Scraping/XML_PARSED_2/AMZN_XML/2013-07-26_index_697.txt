our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in in foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit reduce

out fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation us to make based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through to individual to product or and recoverable of each disposition category these about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance at june we would have an additional cost of of approximately million goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is we test goodwill for impairment by first the book value of net assets to the fair value of the if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is second step is to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the cash of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net and operating based primarily on category expansion market segment share and general economic certain of cash involve and with limited financial history and revenue in these could significantly change the amount of impairment if any table of contents during the quarter management the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the no were that an update to our annual impairment test as measure of sensitivity decrease in the fair value of any of our as of would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price are short term swing or longer term trend as measure of sensitivity decrease from our june stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for to vest the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of and the price of our common stock the estimation of stock that will ultimately vest judgment for the amount that will be and to the extent actual or differ from our current such will be as cumulative adjustment in the period are we consider many when employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our forfeiture rate quarterly change to our forfeiture rate would have had an approximately million impact on our operating income our forfeiture at june and were we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for compensation expense for example over of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four is in the first year if early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under straight line method income we are subject to income in the and numerous foreign significant judgment is in and our provision and for these during the ordinary course of business there are many for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than in where we have lower statutory and higher than in where we have higher statutory by in for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by in foreign currency exchange by entry into and and to our by and by in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and or by in the relevant tax accounting and other administrative and with the united many in the union and number of other actively considering in this regard fundamental to the tax applicable to corporate in addition we are subject to audit in various and such may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax are reasonable the final outcome of tax and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax and in an audit litigation or the relevant

related to internal use that are reflected as cash used in payment and related transaction operating and interest on our long term cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise and other generally to our net because primarily use credit to buy from us our receivables from settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve ended june to the comparable prior year

stock pay or repurchase refinance or otherwise our debt for strategic or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt would likely be dilutive to our

estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in in foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax

reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate

are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the
