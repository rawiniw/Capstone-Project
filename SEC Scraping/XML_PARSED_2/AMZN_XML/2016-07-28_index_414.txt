merchandise based on the or sold within our retail business we focus on providing wide selection of page and to our across many this wide and growing selection of and whether sold by us or third party often share combined and fulfillment marketing technology and content infrastructure we are largely neutral as to whether product is sold by us or third party instead we focus on customer selection availability and in our delivery and fulfillment with respect to prime membership we allocate among the we provide in the prime offering such as shipping prime video prime music prime and access to the kindle library similar to third party such are among media and based on the prime provided within those product and service for example revenue to the two day prime shipping benefit is classified in the same category as the product to which the free shipping benefit is applied other and that prime obtain such as prime video prime music prime and the subscription to the kindle library are classified within media accordingly prime membership revenue growth is and reflected within the category to which it is as in our response to comment we view prime as but one of many product and service that are designed to enhance overall customer experience and convenience promote customer loyalty and provide access to the many and that are available through our because of this nature of our product and service and the fact that prime revenue may be variously among media and depending on prime usage we do not consider the growth in prime membership revenue in the similarity of and within media and with respect to our categorization of and revenue within media and we currently offer of millions of unique and we have not considered either growth or in how best to group and into similar growth are not useful distinction for us because we are to grow selection and volume across the large majority of the we offer with regard to we mention on page of the that we are on income from rather than gross profit or gross due to the diversity of our product and for example the same product sold through our for the same price can produce different depending on whether it is sold by or by third party seller since from by are as net amount our presentation of revenue data for the media and with by providing meaningful information about of similar and that reflect the growth and development of our business beyond our initial as an book retailer our media category the of in all that would be from media retailer such as music video and other similar entertainment and educational and our category the expansion of our business beyond media our retail infrastructure to offer wide array of durable and related while our business objective is to grow revenue across the and that are available through our we believe that these two have appropriate and meaningful as in the have in media distinct category of and that can be in both digital and and through either discrete or through subscription streaming as well we believe and also recognize media and as two distinct of similar and page within the meaning of because they allow of our to other that offer media and entertainment and as to media and to other general as to beyond these two we have not any meaningful between the and sold through our given the vast selection of goods and that we aim to make available to our and the fact that no individual product or service more than of net finally consistent with our ongoing mission to maximize selection of and for our our product and service have continued to grow and become ever more we expect that to continue and the outlined in this response concerning across and to increase thus while we have our historical practice of providing data for
