by first the book value of net assets to the fair value of the if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is second step is to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the cash of future cash are based on our best estimate of future net and operating based primarily on category expansion market segment share and general economic we conduct our annual impairment test as of of each year and have determined there to be no impairment for any of the there were no from the date of our assessment through that would require an update to our annual impairment test see note goodwill and acquired intangible

equity marketable restricted for longer than one year the majority of which are attributable to of bank and debt related to our international and intellectual property net of amortization table of contents we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income and rated money market funds such are included in cash and cash or marketable on the consolidated balance classified as available for sale and at fair value with unrealized gains and included in other comprehensive loss equity our investment in are for the equity method of accounting

investment activity net of tax on our consolidated of our share of the net income or loss of our equity method operating and non operating gains and which can have significant impact on our equity method investment activity and the carrying value of those we regularly evaluate these which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment we also consider whether our equity method generate sufficient cash from their operating or to meet their and repay their when they come due we record incremental of in equity method at cost in our ownership percentage of an through dilution are generally valued at fair value with the difference between fair value and our cost reflected as gain or loss in our equity method investment activity in the event we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over an equity method we would discontinue accounting for the investment under the equity method equity without readily determinable fair for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are for the cost method of accounting and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance under the cost method are carried at cost and are only for other than temporary in fair value certain and additional equity that have readily determinable fair are classified as available for sale and are included in marketable in our consolidated balance sheet and are at fair value with unrealized gains and net of tax included in other comprehensive loss we periodically evaluate whether in fair of our below their book value are other than temporary this evaluation of several qualitative and quantitative regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery additionally we assess whether we have to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be to sell any investment before recovery of its cost basis considered include market recent financial and operating from any recent or of credit quality of debt instrument other publicly available information that may affect the value of our duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and for holding the investment long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill are for impairment whenever or in indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be

or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable table of contents for long lived assets used in impairment are only if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probability weighted future cash we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value long lived assets are considered for sale when certain criteria are met when management to plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale

when the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets our recent cumulative earnings experience and of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction the carry forward available to us for tax and other relevant we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on pro rata basis we utilize two step approach to and measuring uncertain income tax tax the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by if the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit resolution of related or litigation the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the amount which is more than likely of being upon ultimate settlement we consider many when and our tax and tax which may

that the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment by first the book value of net assets to the fair value of the if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is second step is to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying

we utilize two step approach to and measuring uncertain income tax tax the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by if the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not

such as for similar assets and in active for identical or similar assets and in that are not active or other that are observable or can be by observable market data level based on unobservable
