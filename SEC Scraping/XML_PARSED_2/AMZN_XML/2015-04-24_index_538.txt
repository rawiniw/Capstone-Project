operating expense income net was and and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets income loss from the above income loss from from we believe that income from is more meaningful

currency gains income tax provision or benefit from income for interim is determined an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit related foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in for which we may not realize related tax benefit primarily due to of foreign reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we record valuation against the

foreign exchange in the period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating the increase or decrease in resulting from in foreign exchange from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating non financial for use of non financial and other sec define and prescribe the for use of certain non financial information our of free cash flow operating with and without stock based compensation and the effect of foreign exchange on our consolidated of meet the definition of non financial we provide multiple of free cash flow and based on them because we believe these provide additional perspective on the impact of property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance free cash cash flow is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development which are included in cash flow from the following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable cash flow measure net cash provided by

of these free cash flow have as they omit certain of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example these of free cash flow do not incorporate the portion of principal of debt or cash for business additionally our mix of property and equipment with cash or other may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow only as complement to our entire consolidated of cash operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our when stock based compensation and value such table of in addition unlike other
