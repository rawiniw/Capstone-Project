for use of non financial and other sec define and prescribe the for use of certain non financial information our measure of free cash flow the definition of non financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with in accordance with and free cash flow should not be upon to the exclusion of financial free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash since of property and equipment internal use and development are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of debt related to capital and for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash for quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable in accordance with see supplemental financial information and business metrics in exhibit to this current report on form return on capital is ratio based on free cash flow and as such is also non financial measure return on capital is trailing twelve free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current excluding the current portion if any of our long term debt over the
