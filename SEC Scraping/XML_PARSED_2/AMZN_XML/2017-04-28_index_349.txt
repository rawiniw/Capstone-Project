network expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment provided by third mix of and sold and our ability to affect customer service per unit by in our and to our customer self service table of because payment and fulfillment associated with seller are based on the gross purchase price of underlying and payment and related transaction and fulfillment are higher as percentage of versus our retail by our have higher fulfillment as percent of net the fulfillment in absolute in to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to variable corresponding with product and service volume and

television advertising and other our marketing are largely variable based on growth in and in to the extent there is or competition for these traffic or to the extent our mix of these we would expect
