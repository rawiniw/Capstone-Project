one of these dont just swipe right get married well to report that been monogamous in this regard after two of risk taking and teamwork and with generous of good fortune all along the way we are now happily wed to what believe are three such life prime and each of these was bold bet at first and sensible people worried often that they could not work but at this point its become pretty clear how special they are and how lucky we are to have them its also clear that there are no in business we know its our job to always nourish and fortify them well approach the job with our usual customer obsession rather than competitor focus heartfelt passion for invention commitment to operational excellence and willingness to think long term with good execution and bit of good luck prime and can be serving and earning financial for many to come early days were not easy first we think seven people came if you count my and into which was basically fixed price version of again no but then we into internally was known as for single detail page the idea was to take our most valuable retail real estate our product detail and let third party compete against our own retail category it was more convenient for and within year it for of today more than of our are sold by more than two million third party ordered more than two billion from in the success of this hybrid model accelerated the flywheel were initially drawn by our fast growing selection of sold at great with great customer experience by then third to offer side by side we more attractive to which drew even more this also added to our of scale which we along by lowering and shipping for these in the we rolled them out as quickly as we could to our other the result was that seamlessly with all of our global we work hard to reduce the for and increase the success of their through our selling coach program we generate steady stream of machine learned more than million in typical week about to avoid going out of stock add selection thats selling and sharpen their to be more competitive these translate to in to to further were now helping in each of our and in where we dont have presence reach out to our in outside their home we from more than different last year and them connect with in almost one fifth of our overall third party now occur outside the home and our cross nearly doubled last year in the eu can open single account manage their business in multiple and make available across our five eu more recently weve cross for and helping them obtain ocean shipping from to and north at preferential bulk is the heart of our fast growing in since all of our selection in is by third party in now more selection than any other commerce site in with more than million from over with our easy ship service we pick up from seller and handle delivery all the way to the end customer building upon easy ship the team recently now service that everyday from local and pop to in two to four convenience for our and increasing for the in the service perhaps most important for weve fulfillment by but ill save that for after we discuss prime prime ten ago we prime originally designed as an all you can eat free and fast shipping program we were told repeatedly that it was risky move and in some ways it was in its first year we gave up many millions of in shipping revenue and there was no simple math to show that it would be worth it our decision to go ahead was built on the positive wed seen when we free super saver shipping and an intuition that would quickly grasp that they were being the best deal in the history of shopping in addition analysis told us that if we scale we would be able to significantly lower the cost of fast shipping our inventory retail business was the foundation of prime in addition to retail to build each of our category specific we have large scale to much of inventory replenishment inventory placement and product the precise delivery date promise of prime operating our fulfillment in way and all of this together is one of the great of our global team our network of fulfillment expanded from in when we prime to this year we are now on our eighth generation of fulfillment design proprietary to manage receipt stowing and shipment which with our acquisition of kiva in now more than to support the stowing and retrieval of at higher density and lower cost than ever before our inventory retail business remains our best customer acquisition vehicle for prime and critical part of building out that attract traffic and third party though fast delivery remains core prime benefit we are finding ways to pump energy into prime two of the most important are digital and in we added prime instant video as benefit now with of of and available for unlimited streaming in the and weve expanding the program into the and as well were significant amount on this content and its important that we monitor its impact we ask ourselves is it worth it is it driving prime among other we watch prime free trial conversion to membership renewal and product purchase by entering through this channel we like what we see so far and plan to keep here while most of our spend is on licensed content were also starting to develop original content the team is off to strong start our show transparent the first from streaming service to win golden globe for best series and tumble leaf won the for best animated series for in addition to the critical acclaim the are promising an advantage of our original is that its first run is on prime it already anywhere else together with the quality of the that first run status to be one of the leading to the attractive we also like the fixed cost nature of original we get to spread that fixed cost across our large membership base finally our business model for original content is unique pretty sure were the first company to have figured out how to make winning golden globe pay off in of power and baby designed and from kindle to fire to echo also pump energy into prime such as prime instant video and prime music and generally drive higher engagement with every element of the ecosystem and theres more to come our device team strong and exciting ahead prime done improving on its original fast and free shipping promise either the recently prime now prime free two hour delivery on of of or one hour delivery for fee lots of early read like this one in the past six my husband and have made an embarrassing number of through prime now its cheap easy and insanely fast weve in and and more are coming soon now id like to talk about fulfillment by is so important because it is glue that inextricably links and prime thanks to and prime are no longer two in fact at this point cant really think about them separately their economics and customer are now happily and deeply is service for when seller to use they stow their inventory in our fulfillment we take on all logistics customer service and product if customer an item and an inventory item we can ship both to the customer in one box huge efficiency gain but even more important when seller their can become prime eligible firm grasp of the obvious is more difficult than one would think it should be but its useful to try if you ask what do want the correct and obvious answer is they want more so what when join and their become prime eligible they get more notice also what from prime point of view every time seller prime get more prime eligible selection the value of membership goes up this is powerful for our flywheel the circle energy into prime and prime energy into in survey of of more than increase in unit after joining in the holiday period shipped grew over the prior year and more than of third party prime grew more than in the last year and is win for and win for web radical idea when it was nine ago web is now big and growing fast were the early on demand pay as you go cloud storage and compute dramatically the speed of starting business like and all used and remain today since then large have been coming on board as well and theyre choosing to use for the same primary reason the did speed and agility lower it cost is attractive and sometimes the absolute cost can be enormous but cost alone could never overcome in performance or functionality are dependent on it its mission critical so the proposition can save you significant amount on your annual it bill and my service is almost as good as what you have now wont get too many what really want in this arena is better and faster and if better and faster can come with side dish of cost terrific but the cost is the gravy not the steak it is so high leverage you dont want to imagine competitor whose it department is more nimble than yours every company list of technology that the business would like to see as soon as possible the painful reality is that tough triage are always made and many never get done even those that get are often late or with incomplete functionality if an it department can figure out how to deliver number of business technology faster theyll be significant and real value for their organization these are the main is growing so quickly it are that when they adopt they get more done they spend less time on low value add like operating system capacity scaling and so on and so on just as important they get access to powerful and that dramatically simplify building scalable secure robust high performance and those and are continuously and seamlessly behind the without customer effort today more than million active as and of all sizes use in every imaginable business segment usage grew by approximately in the fourth quarter of versus the prior year like ge major league baseball and are building on these range from for and to mobile for of trucks other like the financial and the and exchange commission are to analyze and take action on vast of data and many like cond nast and news corp are legacy critical and in some entire to weve our pace of innovation as weve gone along from nearly and in to in and last year there are many that would be interesting to talk about from and to lambda and the container service to the but for of brevity going to limit myself to one our recently aurora we hope aurora will offer normal for very important but also very problematic technology that is critical underpinning of many the relational aurora is compatible engine that the speed and availability of high end commercial with the simplicity and cost effectiveness of open source performance is up to better than typical at one tenth the cost of commercial relational is an arena thats been pain point for and for long time and were very excited about aurora believe is one of those dreamy business that can be serving and earning financial for many into the future why am optimistic for one thing the of the opportunity is big ultimately global spend on infrastructure data and more similar to the way think about retail for all practical believe is market unconstrained second its current leadership position which is significant is strong ongoing advantage we work hard very hard to make as easy to use as possible even so its still necessarily complex set of with rich functionality and non trivial learning curve once youve become proficient at building complex with you do not want to have to learn set of and assuming the set you already understand works for you this is in no way something we can rest on but if we continue to serve our in truly outstanding way they will have rational preference to stick with us in addition also because of our leadership position we now have of what are effectively roaming the world moving from one company to another become our best people we used where used to work and we should consider it here think wed get more done its good sign that proficiency with and its is already something are to their finally optimistic that will have strong on capital this is one we as team examine because is capital intensive the good news is we like what we see when we do these analyses structurally is far less capital intensive than the mode its do it yourself which have low utilization almost always below of across much higher utilization and correspondingly higher capital efficiency further once again our leadership position scale can provide us relative advantage on capital efficiency well continue to watch and shape the business for good on capital is young and it is still growing and we think we can continue to lead if we continue to execute with our needs foremost in mind career choice before want to take moment to update on something were excited about and of three ago we an innovative employee benefit the career choice program where we pay of tuition for to take for in demand such as airplane mechanic or nursing regardless of whether the are relevant to career at the idea was simple enable choice we know that for some of our fulfillment and customer service will be career for might be stepping stone on the way to job somewhere else job that may require if the right training can make the difference we want to help and so far we have been able to help over who have in the program in eight different theres been so much interest that we are now building so college and technical classes can be taught inside our fulfillment making it even easier for to achieve these there are now eight offering classes taught in our purpose built with high end technology and designed with glass to inspire to participate and generate encouragement from we believe career choice is an innovative way to draw great talent to serve in our fulfillment and customer service these can become to great with as we expand around the world or enable the opportunity to follow their passion in other in demand technical like our very first career choice graduate did when she career as nurse in her community would also like to invite you to come join the more than people who have up so far to see the magic that after you click buy on by touring one of our fulfillment in addition to we are now offering at around the world in the and graben in and to expand you can sign up for tour at prime and web are three big were lucky to have them and were determined to improve and nurture them make them even better for you can also count on us to work hard to find fourth weve already got number of in work and as we some twenty ago well continue to make bold with the unfolding in front of us to serve better through invention we assure you we wont stop trying as always attach copy of our original letter our approach remains the same because its still day founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
