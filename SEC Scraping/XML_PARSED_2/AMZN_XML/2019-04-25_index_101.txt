recognition privacy act of that would prohibit commercial of facial recognition technology from and re data for or without their consent in the united legislation that would ban government use of facial recognition technology been recently in the of and and in the city of san the company itself noted the potential materiality of associated with regulatory framework that not yet caught up with such in its discussion of risk in its it is not clear how governing such as property ownership libel data protection and personal privacy apply to the commerce digital content web and artificial

largely unregulated environment as well as local state and federal government may escalate legal to the company to establish around consumer privacy posing the risk of major for regulatory and litigation the supreme court in expanded the potential liability for that sell facial recognition technology under the biometric information privacy act by ruling that only need to prove technical rather than actual injury or damages further clearing the way for potential facial technology should have disclosure from the company about how legal risk halting of to government would allow the board to properly understand and convey to the extent to which these present legal and the plan to mitigate those before it is too late human capital management risk by of to government status as an employer of choice and ability to be consistent with the of its is being by the internal management and potential sale of surveillance the lack of transparency about the nature of its and failure to respond to who do not want to use their time and talent in support of selling surveillance technology to government may be hurting ability to attract hire retain and maintain good with losing talent as in the seek employment from who can match their an report found that of college prefer an employer who positive social atmosphere and that do good over higher salary said it was important their employer demonstrate social responsibility the attempt this past june to sell to ice backlash among of whom an open letter to the company in protest saying we learn from history and we understand how were employed in the to help did not take responsibility then and by the time their role was understood it was too late we will not let that happen again the time to act is now we call on you to stop selling facial recognition to law enforcement in addition to that present these surveillance raised by are mirrored within the company itself in how it its own the company was two recently that would allow it to track its hand through by detailed through artificial intelligence the company can also obtain and record highly private information such as when an employee bathroom break this degree of fourth amendment privacy intrusion to the mix of work culture already for to work long and perform above all else threatening the long term performance and health of the company overall halting of to government is an application of the precautionary principle independently by potential human and other critical prior to of product not only who may be by company but also minimize expensive legal operational and and in turn by supporting this proposal are the precautionary principle adopted globally in as part of the united rio convention on sustainable development the precautionary principle that where there are of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as reason for protective it been by in to phase out the use of toxic and in legislation on environmental and health protection this approach is consistent with prudent risk management for are the precautionary principle by to assess risk technology powerful and potentially irreversible threat to civil and human as consequence it also shareholder value the precautionary approach by halting of facial recognition to government and by and on these and is therefore necessary here to ensure sound stewardship at the company the proposal that the company can and should undertake more high level oversight of these before marketing the technology especially for use by government and police this is especially the case because warn that facial recognition the government the power to violate civil religious and people of color in hyper powered ways in the technology industry overall often seek to gain market advantage by their place as the first mover of product or technology however in the case of the application of the precautionary principle is warranted because the extensive of marketing the technology far outweigh any potential of being first mover of this dangerous technology management and fail to address the of of and an independent assessment is to ensure it will not cause harm policy to mitigate of of are insufficient and ineffectual in its opposition statement that the acceptable use policy against by illegal or harmful use of in the opposition statement that who gain access to deploy must comply with its acceptable use policy which the use of its for any illegal harmful fraudulent or offensive use the violation of related to privacy discrimination and civil and that not received single report of being used in harmful manner as in the proposal recent experience however that the acceptable use policy is no guarantee that the platform will not be used in harmful manner according to multiple media based news site used to openly store million on identification and account the problem was by at an independent security firm which reportedly sent to over many to alert it to the problem reportedly to respond to those itself its stated position that company protect and the company from significant risk for example in the face of the of concern by and civil leading company spokesman as above and in the opposition statement to the proposal tempered the position calling for government regulation and dialogue among it is frankly difficult to understand why the company is opposing the current proposal as the proposal itself to provide the opportunity to fulfill exactly the of own invitation for open honest and earnest dialogue with the are concerned with by government particularly currently the is for face recognition to be exempt from the on people during the exercise of their right to free speech in addition long standing that have the and department of homeland security from the identity of during the exercise of free speech appear to be at risk therefore the acceptable use policy are far from self and as the example of the request for waiver of normal civil the evidence that the acceptable use policy is ineffective at protecting people from the of surveillance technology in the of government insufficient board oversight of related to governance of the significant by is instead of company oversight it that the responsibility to the customer for that the technology is not used in illegal or harmful ways that threaten shareholder value this is too significant of an issue for the company to abdicate its responsibility to protect human the are concerned that the board is not to adequately identify and assess the by the overall lack that would give them the background or to assess the human of machine learning artificial intelligence and the primary behind product like one possible exception is director who in computer science from and an interest in the board also any governance committee with these this is another reason why should be stopped until an independent group of the ability to assess the and advise the board on whether or how it could proceed with of to in governance oversight and management to assess and address the ethical legal and associated with the use of its peer in the technology sector have governance to oversee human and ethics by the sale of three board leadership development and compensation committee an audit committee and and corporate governance committee none of the committee make mention of human or ethics in any manner for company as large as with business with in as many of society as this is an especially egregious omission of purpose alphabet parent of and
