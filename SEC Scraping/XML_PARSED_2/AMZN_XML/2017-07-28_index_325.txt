foreign currency gains tax law in case law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower for we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably
