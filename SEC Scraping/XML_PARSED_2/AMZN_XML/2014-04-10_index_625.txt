intervention under the internal revenue code in any political campaign such as direct and indirect political to political or political independent or on behalf of federal state or local disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and its and critical for compliance with federal ethics moreover the supreme court united decision the importance of political spending disclosure to when it said disclosure and to react to the speech of corporate in proper way this transparency the electorate to make informed in transparency and accountability can expose to and business that threaten long term shareholder value while political spending statement on its that generally some aggregate spent on government find this too broad diffuse and to be meaningful complete picture of the political spending is not available from publicly available data for example to trade that are used for political are undisclosed and some even management does not know how trade use money this is why scored near the of the index of corporate accountability and disclosure which the in the scored just out of possible this proposal is simple it to disclose its political spending to trade and other tax exempt that are used for political doing so would bring in line with large number of leading and support political disclosure and accountability and present this information on their board and need comprehensive disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets therefore please vote for this common sense proposal on sound corporate

corporate funds the are subject to federal regulation detailed public disclosure the pac regular public with the federal election commission and political to and by the pac are to be disclosed these are publicly available on the at disclosure we do not believe that an additional ad report as in the proposal would be an effective and prudent use of our time and the board that you vote against this proposal regarding report concerning corporate political beneficial ownership of the following table forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of except as otherwise by each person or entity known by us to beneficially own more than of our common stock each director each executive officer for whom compensation information is given in the summary compensation table in this proxy statement and all and executive as group except as otherwise and subject to any of the spouse we believe that the beneficial of common stock listed below based on information furnished by such have sole voting and investment power with respect to such as of we had of common stock outstanding name and address of beneficial owner amount terry avenue north wa capital world south hope street ca seely brown ryder all and executive as group less than as of based on information provided in schedule capital world division of capital research and management company sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the and no voting or investment power with respect to the for of the of the exchange act of capital world is to be the beneficial owner of such however it expressly that it is in fact the beneficial owner of such by charitable trust of which is trustee and as to which he voting and investment power beneficial ownership of the of common stock by the charitable trust issuable under stock based award that as to which or may be to share voting and investment power beneficially by other executive not individually listed in the table and as to which one of the other executive may be to share voting and investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the letter to we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as result we may make and weigh differently than some for example under our compensation philosophy we have stock based compensation that over an extended period of time in addition we believe stock based compensation to at all across the company in customer centric people who think and act like because they are our compensation philosophy for our executive in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our and is by the following first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program strong long term to our with our third our compensation program performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as basis for compensation as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program and our core customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like and thinking long term high bar and frugality for our executive who are employed on an at will basis we provide few and generally do not provide cash other than in hire context we do not maintain deferred compensation supplemental executive retirement plan cash severance or change in control for our executive except as noted below we do not provide cash or equity tied to performance criteria which could cause to focus solely on short term at the expense of long term growth and innovation base consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base for executive are designed to provide minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those to senior leadership at similarly situated base ranged from for to for due to substantial ownership in again not to receive additional compensation in and never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of executive total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly executive receive sizeable stock based at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based on periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over period of executive may not necessarily receive stock based every year for example because annual total compensation the entire fair value as of the grant date of stock award in that year without regard to the fact that the grant over number of executive total compensation will be higher in in which he or she grant to in which he or she does not receive grant due to substantial stock ownership he he is appropriately and his are appropriately with never received any stock based compensation from since late we have used restricted stock as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock the long term of executive and and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock restricted stock unit grant and vesting for executive whether for hire or subsequent are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after from the vice president of human and the chief executive officer these restricted stock generally vest over period of six vesting does not accelerate as result of termination of employment or upon change in control unless the company does not assume the for hire the vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of past compensation from the executive former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior at the executive level of responsibility and to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology for periodic the vice president of human the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider variety of the executive level of responsibility past to our performance our core and to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated at other retail and technology generally the leadership development and compensation committee whether to make periodic to executive in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally between and for both hire and periodic restricted stock unit the vice president of human and chief executive officer develop grant by subjectively the above to set total compensation target for each executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit to help meet those total compensation based on stock price appreciation taking into account the executive cash compensation and the value of stock based compensation vesting in subsequent if any in this process the vice president of human and chief executive officer view total compensation for given year as cash compensation to be in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account compensation periodic for smaller number of do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in the executive did not receive any equity in the compensation of our executive in the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of equity as well as information from third party compensation data for retail and technology apple best buy cisco dell oracle target and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee discretion in executive compensation and does not require that compensation be set at specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data at the time
