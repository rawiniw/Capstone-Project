physical gross merchandise sold on by independent third party mostly small and medium sized as opposed to own first party third party have grown from of the total to to put it bluntly third party are kicking our first party butt badly and its high bar too because our first party business grown dramatically over that period from billion in to billion this past year the compound annual growth rate for our first party business in that time period is but in that same time third party have grown from billion to billion compound annual growth rate of to provide an external gross merchandise in that period have grown at compound rate of from billion to billion why did independent do so much better selling on than they did on and why were independent able to grow so much faster than own highly organized first party organization there one answer but we do know one extremely important part of the answer we independent compete against our first party business by in and offering them the very best selling we could imagine and build there are many such that help manage inventory process track create and sell across and were more every year but of great importance are fulfillment by and the prime membership program in combination these two meaningfully the customer experience of from independent with the success of these two now so well established its difficult for most people to fully appreciate today just how radical those two were at the time we them we in both of these at significant financial risk and after much internal debate we had to continue significantly over time as we experimented with different and we could not foresee with certainty what those would eventually look like let alone whether they would succeed but they were forward with intuition and heart and with optimism intuition curiosity and the power of wandering from very early on in life we knew we to create culture of people who are curious they like to invent even when theyre they are fresh with mind they see the way we do as just the way we do now mentality us approach big hard to solve with humble conviction that success can come through iteration invent launch reinvent relaunch start over rinse repeat again and again they know the path to success is anything but straight sometimes often actually in business you do know where going and when you do you can be efficient put in place plan and execute in contrast wandering in business is not efficient but its also not random its by hunch gut intuition curiosity and powered by deep conviction that the prize for is big enough that its worth being little messy and tangential to find our way there wandering is an essential counter balance to efficiency you need to employ both the outsized the non linear are highly likely to require wandering millions of range from to large government to each looking to build better for their end we spend lot of time thinking about what those want and what the people inside them dev chief digital chief information security want much of what we build at is based on listening to its critical to ask what they want listen carefully to their and figure out plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly speed in business no business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession but its also not enough the biggest needle will be that dont know to ask for we must invent on their behalf we have to tap into our own inner imagination about whats possible itself as whole is an example no one for no one turns out the world was in fact ready and hungry for an offering like but didnt know it we had hunch our curiosity took the necessary financial and building and countless as we within that same pattern many for example we highly scalable low latency key value now used by of and on the listening carefully to side we loudly that felt constrained by their commercial and had been unhappy with their for these are expensive proprietary have high lock in and punitive we spent several building our own engine aurora fully and compatible service with the same or better durability and availability as the commercial but at one tenth of the cost we were not when this worked but were also optimistic about specialized for specialized over the past to ran most of their relational the broad familiarity with relational among made this technology the go to even when it wasnt ideal though sub optimal the data set sizes were often small enough and the acceptable query long enough that you could make it work but today many are very large of data and and the for have modern are driving the need for low real time and the ability to process millions of per second its not just key value like but also in memory like time series like and ledger like quantum ledger the right tool for the right job money and your product to market faster were also plunging into helping harness machine learning weve been working on this for long time and as with other important our initial to externalize some of our early internal machine learning were it took of wandering experimentation iteration and refinement as well as valuable from our to enable us to find which just ago the heavy lifting complexity and guesswork from each step of the machine learning process ai today of are building machine learning on of with we continue to enhance the service by reinforcement learning reinforcement learning steep learning curve and many moving which largely put it out of reach of all but the most well funded and technical until now none of this would be possible without culture of curiosity and willingness to try totally on behalf of and are to our customer centric wandering and listening is now billion annual run rate business and growing fast the impossible today remains small player in global retail we represent low single digit percentage of the retail market and there are much in every country where we operate and thats largely because nearly of retail remains in brick and mortar for many we considered how we might serve in physical but felt we first to invent something that would really delight in that environment with go we had clear vision get rid of the worst thing about physical retail no one to wait in line instead we store where you could walk in pick up what you and leave getting there was hard technically hard it the of of smart computer and around the world we had to design and build our own proprietary and and invent computer vision the ability to stitch together imagery from of and we had to do it in way where the technology worked so well that it simply into the invisible the reward been the response from the experience of shopping at go as magical we now have in san and and are excited about the future failure needs to scale too as company everything needs to scale the of your if the of your growing not going to be at that can actually move the needle will be at the right scale for company of our if we occasionally have dollar of course we wont undertake such cavalierly we will work hard to make them good but not all good will ultimately pay out this kind of large scale risk taking is part of the service we as large company can provide to our and to society the good news for is that single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many development of the fire phone and echo was around the same time while the fire phone was failure we were able to take our as well as the and accelerate our building echo and the vision for echo and was inspired by the star trek computer the idea also had in two other where wed been building and wandering for machine learning and the cloud from early days machine learning was an essential part of our product and gave us front row seat to the of the cloud after many of development echo in powered by who in the cloud no customer was for echo this was definitely us wandering market research doesnt help if you had gone to customer in and said would you like black always on cylinder in your kitchen about the of can that you can talk to and ask that also turns on your and music guarantee you have at you strangely and said no thank you since that first generation echo have more than million last year we ability to understand and answer by more than while of to make more knowledgeable than ever doubled the number of to over and spoke to of more in to the number of with built in more than doubled in there are now more than different available with built in from and to and smart home much more to come one last thing before as said in the first shareholder letter more than ago our focus is on and retaining versatile and talented who can think like that in our and as with so many other at we use not just analysis but also intuition and heart to find our way forward last year we raised our minimum wage to an hour for all full time part time temporary and seasonal across the this wage hike more than as well as over seasonal who worked at across the country last holiday we strongly believe that this will benefit our business as we invest in our but that is not what drove the decision we had always competitive wages but we decided it was time to lead to offer wages that went beyond competitive we did it because it like the right thing to do today challenge our retail you know who you are to match our employee and our minimum wage do it better yet go to and throw the gauntlet back at us its kind of competition that will benefit everyone many of the other we have for our came as much from the heart as the head before the career choice program which up to of tuition and towards certificate or diploma in qualified of study leading to in demand for our even if those take them away from more than have now taken advantage of the program which to grow similarly our career program hourly in critical job like resume writing how to communicate effectively and in of last year in continuation of these we the pledge to and we will be through our range of innovative training our are not limited to our current or even to the present to train we have million through our recently future engineer program to support stem and education around the country for elementary high school and university with particular focus on more and to these we also continue to take advantage of the incredible of our we are well on our way to meeting our pledge to hire and military by and through the technical apprenticeship program we are providing on the job training in like cloud huge thank you to our for us to serve you while always us to do even better to our for your support and to all our for your hard work and spirit all across are listening to and wandering on their behalf as always attach copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
