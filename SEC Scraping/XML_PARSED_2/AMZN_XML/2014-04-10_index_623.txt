of the scope of our opportunity and as well the inventive spirit and push for exceptional quality with which theyre should underscore again that this is subset there are many in this letter that are just as promising consequential and interesting as those we have the good fortune of large inventive team and patient customer culture great large and small are happening everyday on behalf of and at all throughout the company this distribution of invention throughout the company not limited to the senior is the only way to get robust high throughput innovation what were doing is and fun we get to work in the future failure comes part and parcel with invention its not optional we understand that and believe in failing early and until we get it right when this process works it our are relatively small in most can start small and when we hit on something that is really working for we double down on it with to turn it into an even bigger success however its not always as clean as that is messy and over time its certain that well fail at some big too id like to close by joy covey joy was in the early days and she left an indelible mark on the company joy was brilliant intense and so fun she lot and her were always wide missing nothing she was substance over optics she was long term thinker she had deep keel joy was bold she had profound impact on all of us on the senior team and on the entire culture part of her will always be here making sure we watch the see the world around us and all have fun feel super lucky to be part of the team as always attach copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
