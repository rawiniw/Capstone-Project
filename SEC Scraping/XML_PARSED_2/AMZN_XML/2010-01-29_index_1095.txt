evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event or change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment by first the book value of net assets

experience and of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction the carry forward available to us for tax and other relevant we allocate our valuation allowance to current and long term deferred tax assets on pro rata basis we utilize two step approach to and measuring uncertain tax tax the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by if the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit resolution of related or litigation the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the amount which is more than
