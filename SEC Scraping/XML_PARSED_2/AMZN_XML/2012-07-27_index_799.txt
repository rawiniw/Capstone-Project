rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant volatility due to several from variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and foreign currency gains in law and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will reflect the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate that primarily relate to our which are in offset by the adverse effect of in other foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit and have therefore valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset such reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate our effective tax rate may also be adversely impacted by the amount of our tax income relative to our income tax expense and in tax law such as the expiration of the us federal research and development credit at the end of taking these into account we estimate our annual effective tax rate to be higher than both the us federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate as to our current estimate of annual tax income we disproportionate amount of during in for which no tax benefit is in addition the tax provision for income tax expense of million related to the discrete tax impact of the

accounting of this form although we believe that our and are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual may differ significantly from these under different or of available

method of disposition such as through to individual to product or and recoverable of each disposition category these about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance at june we would have an additional cost of of approximately million goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is we test goodwill for impairment by first the book value of net assets to the fair value of the if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is second step is to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the cash of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net and operating based primarily on category expansion market segment share and general economic certain of cash involve and with limited financial history and revenue in these could significantly change the amount of impairment if any table of contents during the quarter management the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the no were that an update to our annual impairment test as measure of sensitivity decrease in the fair value of any of our as of would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price are short term swing or longer term trend as measure of sensitivity decrease from our june stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for to vest the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of and the price of our common stock the estimation of stock that will ultimately vest judgment for the amount that will be and to the extent actual or differ from our current such will be as cumulative adjustment in the period are we consider many when employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our forfeiture rate quarterly change to our forfeiture rate would have had an approximately million impact on our operating income our forfeiture at june and were and we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for compensation expense for example over of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four is in the first year if early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under straight line method income we are subject to income in both the and numerous foreign significant judgment is in and our tax and our provision and for these during the ordinary course of business there are many and for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than in where we have lower statutory and higher than in where we have higher statutory by in for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by in foreign currency exchange by entry into and and to our by by in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and or by in the relevant tax accounting and other and we are subject to audit in various and such may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax are reasonable the final determination of tax and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax and the of an audit or litigation could have material effect on our operating or cash in the period or for which that determination is made as well as prior and subsequent if we determine that additional of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets

rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment in our effective tax rate will reflect the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate that primarily relate to our which are in offset by the adverse effect of in other foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit and have therefore valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset such reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate our effective tax rate may also be adversely impacted by the amount of our tax income relative to our income tax expense and in tax law such as the expiration of the us federal

by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of fixed assets internal use and development we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash since of fixed assets are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of related to capital and for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash table of contents the following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure net cash provided by used in operating for the trailing twelve ended june and in millions net cash provided by used in operating of fixed assets internal use and development free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our when stock based compensation and value such accordingly in addition unlike other centrally operating stock based compensation is not to segment and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our to the consolidated financial operating without stock based compensation since it does not include all primarily related to our more specifically if we did not pay out portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation our cash salary expense
