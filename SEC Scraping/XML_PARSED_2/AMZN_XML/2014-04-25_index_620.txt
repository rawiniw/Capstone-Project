our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during

significant judgment is in and our provision and for these during the ordinary course of business there are many for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax could be

federal net operating loss was approximately million and we had approximately million of federal tax potentially available to offset future tax the federal research and development credit in as we utilize our federal net operating and tax we expect cash for to significantly increase we endeavor to optimize our global on cash basis rather than on financial basis our liquidity is also affected by

million million of stock based compensation and million million of stock based compensation of associated with internal use and development amortization of previously was million and million for and majority of our technology are in the most of which are to our north segment infrastructure other technology and operating to support are included in technology and content general and general and administrative in absolute in to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to in payroll and related table of based based compensation was and the primarily due to an increase in the number of stock based compensation to and other operating expense income operating expense income net was and and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets income from the above income from to from interest income and interest income was and we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income and rated money market funds our interest income with the average balance of funds and the we are earning on them which vary depending on the and in which they are the primary of our interest expense are related to our long term debt and capital and lease interest expense was and other income expense income expense net was and the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreign currency gains income tax provision or benefit from income for interim is determined an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several variability in accurately our tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of to which they relate in how we do business and audit foreign currency gains in law and administrative and relative of or for which tax are not additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of tax income for example the impact of discrete and non deductible on our effective tax rate is greater when our tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate and the adverse effect of in certain foreign for which we may not realize tax benefit income in lower tax is primarily related to our which are in for which we may not realize related tax benefit primarily due to of foreign reduce our tax income without corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have valuation against the deferred tax assets associated with for which we may not realize related tax benefit our effective tax rate may also be adversely impacted by the amount of our income relative to our income tax expense and in tax law such as the expiration of the federal research and development credit at the end of income tax expense for was million in we an income tax benefit of million which included discrete tax primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was in table of method investment activity net of method investment activity net of tax was and the primary component of this activity during was our share of gain by related to the sale of its this gain was partially offset by operating by during the period effect of exchange effect on our consolidated of from in exchange versus the

operating the increase or decrease in resulting from in exchange from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating non financial for use of non financial and other sec define and prescribe the for use of certain non financial information our of free cash flow operating with and without stock based compensation and the effect of exchange on our consolidated of meet the definition of non financial free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with in accordance with and free cash flow should not be upon to the exclusion of financial free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of property and equipment internal use and development which are included in cash flow from we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash flow from since of property and equipment internal use and development are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of debt property and equipment acquired under capital and other for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash table of following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure net cash provided by used in operating for the trailing twelve ended march and in millions twelve net cash provided by used in operating of property and equipment internal use and development free cash flow net cash provided by used in net cash provided by used in operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our when stock based compensation and value such accordingly in addition unlike other centrally operating stock based compensation is not to
