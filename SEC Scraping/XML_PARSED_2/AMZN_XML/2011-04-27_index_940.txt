of inventory are inherently uncertain as measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance we would have an additional cost of of approximately million for goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or change that that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is we test goodwill for impairment by first the book value of net assets to the fair value of the if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is second step is to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the cash of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net and operating based primarily on category expansion market segment share and general economic certain of cash involve and with limited financial history and revenue in

income tax and the of an audit or litigation could have material effect on our operating or cash in the period or for which that determination is made as well as prior and subsequent if we determine
