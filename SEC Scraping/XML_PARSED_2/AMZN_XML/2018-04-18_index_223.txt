put out by the institute of customer service for the th time in row ranked in that survey was also just the business on list which the most sought after to work for in the united and just few ago poll its annual reputation quotient which over on broad range of from workplace environment to social responsibility to and and for the year in row ranked and thank you to the now over who come to work every day with unrelenting customer obsession ingenuity and commitment to operational excellence and on behalf of everywhere want to extend huge thank you to its incredibly for us to see your to these one thing love about is that they are divinely discontent their are never static they go up its human nature we didnt ascend from our gatherer days by being satisfied people have voracious appetite for better way and wow quickly becomes ordinary see that cycle of improvement happening at faster rate than ever before it may be because have such easy access to more information than ever before in only few and with couple taps on their can read compare from multiple see whether in stock find out how fast it will ship or be available for pick up and more these are from retail but sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at and most other as well you can not rest on your in this world wont have it how do you stay ahead of ever rising customer theres no single way to do it its combination of many but high widely and at all of detail are certainly big part of it weve had some over the in our quest to meet the high of weve also had of worth of along the way with those as backdrop id like to share with you the of what weve learned so far about high inside an organization intrinsic or teachable first theres foundational question are high intrinsic or teachable if you take me on your basketball team you can teach me many but you cant teach me to be taller do we first and foremost need to select for high people if so this letter would need to be mostly about but dont think so believe high are teachable in fact people are pretty good at learning high simply through exposure high are contagious bring person onto high team and theyll quickly adapt the opposite is also if low prevail those too will quickly spread and though exposure works well to teach high believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by few core of high which hope to share in this letter universal or domain specific another important question is whether high are universal or domain specific in other if you have high in one area do you automatically have high elsewhere believe high are domain specific and that you have to learn high separately in every arena of interest when had high on on customer care and thankfully on but didnt have high on operational process how to keep fixed fixed how to eliminate at the root how to inspect and much more had to learn and develop high on all of that my were my understanding this point is important because it you humble you can consider yourself person of high in general and still have blind there can be whole of endeavor where you may not even know that your are low or non existent and certainly not world class its critical to be open to that likelihood recognition and scope what do you need to achieve high in particular domain area first you have to be able to recognize what good like in that domain second you must have realistic for how hard it should be how much work it will take to achieve that result the scope let me give you two one is sort of toy illustration but it the point clearly and another is real one that comes up at all the time perfect close friend recently decided to learn to do perfect free standing handstand no leaning against wall not for just few good she decided to start her journey by taking handstand workshop at her yoga studio she then practiced for while but wasnt getting the she so she hired handstand coach yes know what thinking but evidently this is an actual thing that in the very first lesson the coach gave her some wonderful advice most people he said think that if they work hard they should be able to master handstand in about two the reality is that it about six of daily practice if you think you should be able to do it in two just going to end up unrealistic on scope often hidden and undiscussed kill high to achieve high yourself or as part of team you need to form and communicate realistic about how hard something is going to be something this coach understood well six page we dont do or any other slide at instead we write narratively structured six page we silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in kind of study hall not surprisingly the quality of these widely some have the clarity of singing they are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high quality discussion sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum in the handstand example its pretty straightforward to recognize high it wouldnt be difficult to lay out in detail the of well executed handstand and then either doing it or not the writing example is very different the difference between great memo and an average one is much it would be extremely hard to write down the detailed that make up great memo nevertheless find that much of the time react to great very similarly they know it when they see it the standard is there and it is real even if its not easily describable what weve figured out often when memo great its not the inability to recognize the high standard but instead wrong expectation on scope they mistakenly believe high six page memo can be written in one or two days or even few when really it might take week or more theyre trying to perfect handstand in just two and were not coaching them right the great are written and re written with who are to improve the work set aside for couple of days and then again with fresh mind they simply cant be done in day or two the key point here is that you can improve through the simple act of teaching scope that great memo probably should take week or more skill beyond the standard and realistic on scope how about skill surely to write world class memo you have to be an extremely skilled writer is it another element in my view not so much at least not for the individual in the context of the football coach doesnt need to be able to throw and film director doesnt need to be able to act but they both do need to recognize high for those and teach realistic on scope even in the example of writing six page memo thats teamwork someone on the team needs to have the skill but it doesnt have to be you as side note by tradition at never appear on the the memo is from the whole team of high building culture of high is well worth the effort and there are many naturally and most obviously going to build better and for this would be reason enough perhaps little less obvious people are drawn to high they help with recruiting and retention more subtle culture of high is protective of all the invisible but crucial work that goes on in every company talking about the work that no one the work that done when no one is watching in high culture doing that work well is its own reward its part of what it to be professional and finally high are fun once youve tasted high theres no going back so the four of high as we see it they are teachable they are domain specific you must recognize them and you must explicitly coach realistic scope for us these work at all of detail everything from writing to whole clean sheet business we hope they help you too insist on the highest have relentlessly high many people may think these are unreasonably high from the leadership recent the high our strive for have us well and while certainly cant do handstand myself extremely to share some of the we hit last year each of which the fruition of many of collective effort we take none of them for prime post launch we

customer for us to serve you to our for your support and to everywhere for your ingenuity your passion and your high as always attach copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
