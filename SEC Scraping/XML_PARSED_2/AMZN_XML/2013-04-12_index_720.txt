ex ex exhibit to our as regular of this letter will know our energy at comes from the desire to impress rather than the zeal to best we dont take view on which of these is more likely to maximize business success there are and to both and many of highly successful competitor we do work to pay attention to and be inspired by them but it is fact that the customer centric way is at this point element of our culture one advantage perhaps somewhat subtle one of customer driven focus is that it certain type of when were at our best we dont wait for external we are internally driven to improve our and before we have to we lower and increase value for before we have to we invent before we have to these are by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition we think this approach more trust with and rapid in customer experience importantly even in those where we are already the leader thank you every time see that white paper on the front page of know that about to get more for my money than thought would up for prime for the shipping yet now get and and you keep more but not charging more so thanks again for the we now have more than million in prime up since we in prime instant video selection in just over year to more than and the kindle library also more than to over an investment of millions of to make the entire harry potter series available as part of that selection we didnt have to make these in prime we did so related investment major year one is fulfillment by third party the option of their inventory alongside ours in our fulfillment network it been game changer for our seller because their become eligible for prime which their while at the same time with additional prime selection we build that look for when weve provided customer experience that up to our and those then refund one industry observer recently received an from us that said we that you experienced poor video playback while watching the following rental on video on demand were sorry for the inconvenience and have you refund for the following amount we hope to see you again soon by the refund he ended up writing about the experience that experienced poor video playback and they decided to give me refund because of that about first when you order something from we guarantee you the price by us between your order time and the end of the day of the release date just received notice of refund to my credit card for order price protection what great way to do business thank you very much for your fair and honest most are too busy themselves to monitor the price of an item after they order it and our policy could be to require the customer to contact us and ask for the refund doing it is more expensive for us but it also and trust we also have as just it will start paying their monthly sixty days in the industry standard is twice year and that been the standard for long time yet when we interview as infrequent payment is major imagine how youd like it if you were twice year there competitive pressure to pay more than once every six but were doing so by the way though the research was taxing through and am happy to report that recently saw many in use at beach there are five of kindle and believe saw every generation in use except for the first our business approach is to sell premium hardware at roughly we want to make money when people use our not when people buy our we think this us better with for example we dont need our to be on the upgrade treadmill we can be very happy to see people still four year old can keep going kindle our customer service cord but will finish up with very clear example of internally driven motivation web in and weve reduced since ago added enterprise service support and innovative to help be more efficient advisor customer them to known best and then where exist to improve performance enhance security or save money yes we are actively telling theyre paying us more than they need to in the last days have saved millions of through advisor and the service is only getting all of this progress comes in the context of being the widely leader in its area situation where you might worry that external motivation could fail on the other hand internal motivation the drive to get the customer to say wow the pace of innovation fast our heavy in prime kindle digital media and customer experience in general strike some as too generous shareholder indifferent or even at odds with being for profit company as far as can tell is charitable organization being run by of the investment community for the benefit of one outside observer but dont think so to me trying to dole out in just in time fashion would be too clever by half it would be risky in world as fast moving as the one we all live in more fundamentally think long term thinking the circle delighting trust which more business from those even in business take long term view and the of and as write this our recent stock performance been positive but we constantly remind ourselves of an important point as frequently quote investor benjamin graham in our employee all in the short run the market is voting machine but in the long run it is weighing machine we dont celebrate increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience we arent when that and conversely arent when the stock goes the other way we want to be weighed and were always working to build company as as am of our progress and our know that we will make along the way some will be self some will be up by smart and hard working our passion for will drive us to explore narrow and unavoidably many will turn out to be blind but with bit of good fortune there will also be few that open up into broad am incredibly lucky to be part of this large team of outstanding who value our as much as do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work as always attach copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
