day look like thats question just got at our most recent all meeting been people that its day for couple of work in an building day and when took the name with me spend time thinking about this topic day is stasis by irrelevance by excruciating painful decline by death and that is why it is always day to be sure this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion an established company might harvest day for but the final result would still come interested in the question how do you fend off day what are the and tactics how do you keep the vitality of day even inside large organization such question cant have simple answer there will be many multiple and many traps dont know the whole answer but may know of it starter pack of for day defense customer obsession skeptical view of the eager adoption of external and high velocity decision making customer obsession there are many ways to business you can be competitor you can be product you can be technology you can be business model and there are more but in my view obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of day vitality why there are many to customer centric approach but the big one are always beautifully wonderfully dissatisfied even when they report being happy and business is great even when they dont yet know it want something better and your desire to delight will drive you to invent on their behalf no customer ever to create the prime membership program but it sure turns out they it and could give you many such in day you to experiment patiently accept plant protect and double down when you see customer delight customer culture best the where all of that can happen resist as get and more complex theres tendency to manage to this comes in many and sizes and its dangerous subtle and very day common example is process as proxy good process you so you can serve but if not watchful the process can become the thing this can happen very easily in large the process becomes the proxy for the result you want you stop looking at and just make sure doing the process right gulp its not that rare to hear junior leader defend bad outcome with something like well we the process more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process the process is not the thing its always worth do we own the process or does the process own us in day company you might find its the second another example market research and customer can become for something thats especially dangerous when and designing fifty five percent of beta report being satisfied with this feature that is up from in the first survey thats hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead good and deeply understand their customer they spend tremendous energy that intuition they study and understand many rather than only the find on they live with the design not against beta testing or but you the product or service owner must understand the customer have vision and love the offering then beta testing and research can help you find your blind remarkable customer experience with heart intuition curiosity play taste you wont find any of it in survey embrace external the outside world can push you into day if you wont or cant embrace powerful quickly if you fight them probably fighting the future embrace them and you have these big are not that hard to spot they get and written about lot but they can be strangely hard for large to embrace were in the middle of an obvious one right now machine learning and artificial intelligence over the past have broadly that could describe with clear and modern machine learning now allow us to do the same for where the precise is much harder at weve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many now some of this work is highly visible our autonomous prime air delivery the go convenience store that machine vision to eliminate and our cloud based ai assistant we still struggle to keep echo in stock despite our best high quality problem but problem were working on it but much of what we do with machine learning beneath the surface machine learning our for demand forecasting product search product and fraud detection and much more though less visible much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type quietly but meaningfully improving core inside were excited to lower the and to machine learning and ai so of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced our of popular deep learning running on compute for this are already powerful ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop and weve also made higher level available in convenient form whats inside and remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding speech generation and image analysis they can be with simple no machine learning watch this space much more to come high velocity decision making day make high quality but they make high quality slowly to keep the energy and dynamism of day you have to somehow make high quality high velocity easy for start and very for large the senior team at is determined to keep our decision making velocity high speed in business plus high velocity decision making environment is more fun too we dont know all the but here are some first never use one all decision making process many are reversible two way those can use light weight process for those so what if wrong wrote about this in more detail in last letter for something amusing try what is sixty factorial second most should probably be made with somewhere around of the information you wish you had if you wait for in most probably being slow plus either way you need to be good at quickly and correcting bad if good at course correcting being wrong may be less costly than you think whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure third use the phrase disagree and commit this phrase will save lot of time if you have conviction on particular direction even though theres no consensus its helpful to say look know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it disagree and commit by the time at this point no one can know the answer for sure and probably get quick yes this one way if the boss you should do this too disagree and commit all the time we recently particular original told the team my view debatable whether it would be interesting enough complicated to produce the business arent that good and we have lots of other they had completely different opinion and to go ahead wrote back right away with disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing weve ever made consider how much this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment note what this example is not its not me thinking to myself well these are wrong and missing the point but this worth me chasing its genuine disagreement of opinion candid expression of my view chance for the team to weigh my view and quick sincere commitment to go their way and given that this team already brought home golden and just glad they let me in the room at all fourth recognize misalignment early and escalate them immediately sometimes have different and fundamentally different they are not no amount of discussion no number of will resolve that deep misalignment without the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion whoever more stamina the decision seen many of sincere misalignment at over the when we decided to invite third party to compete directly against us on our own product detail that was big one many smart well intentioned were simply not at all with the direction the big decision set up of smaller many of which to be to the senior team youve worn me down is an awful decision making process its slow and de go for quick instead its better so have you settled only for decision quality or are you mindful of decision velocity too are the for you are you falling prey to or do they serve you and most important of all are you delighting we can have the scope and of large company and the spirit and heart of small one but we have to choose it huge thank you to each and every customer for us to serve you to our for your support and to everywhere for your hard work your ingenuity and your passion as always attach copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely jeff founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
