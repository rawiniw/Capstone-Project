corporate tax rate from to certain imposing mandatory one time tax on earnings of foreign tax and how foreign earnings are subject to tax the tax act also enhanced and extended through the option to

material as we complete our analysis of the tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance by the treasury department the and other standard setting we may make to

tax provision or benefit from income for interim is determined an estimate of our annual effective tax rate for discrete if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our tax rate we make cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is
