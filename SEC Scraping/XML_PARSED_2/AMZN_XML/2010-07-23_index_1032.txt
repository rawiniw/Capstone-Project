related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax and the of an audit or litigation could have material effect on our operating or cash in the period or for which that

free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating is cash flow from reduced by of fixed assets internal use and development we use free cash flow and based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from we believe it typically will present more conservative measure of cash since of fixed assets are necessary component of ongoing free cash flow due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of principal of related to capital and for as or cash for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as complement to our entire consolidated of cash table of contents the following is reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable measure net cash provided by used in operating for the trailing twelve ended june and in millions net cash provided by used in operating of fixed assets internal use and development free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in operating with and without stock based compensation is provided to show the impact of stock based compensation which is non cash and from our internal operating and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our when stock based compensation and value such
