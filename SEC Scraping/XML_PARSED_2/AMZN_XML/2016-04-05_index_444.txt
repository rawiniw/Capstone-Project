here both were as tiny and both have grown organically without significant into meaningful and large quickly superficially the two could hardly be more different one and the other one is famous for brown and the other for is it only coincidence that two such dissimilar grew so quickly under one roof luck an outsized role in every endeavor and can assure you weve had bountiful supply but beyond that there is connection between these two under the surface the two are not so different after all they share distinctive organizational culture that deeply about and with conviction on small number of talking about customer obsession rather than competitor obsession eagerness to invent and pioneer willingness to fail the patience to think long term and the taking of professional pride in operational excellence through that lens and retail are very similar indeed word about corporate for better or for worse they are enduring stable hard to change they can be source of advantage or disadvantage you can write down your corporate culture but when you do so it it not it it is slowly over time by the people and by by the of past success and failure that become deep part of the company lore if its distinctive culture it will fit certain people like custom made glove the reason are so stable in time is because people self select someone by competitive zeal may select and be happy in one culture while someone who to pioneer and invent may choose another the world thankfully is full of many high highly distinctive corporate we never claim that our approach is the right one just that its ours and over the last two weve collected large group of like minded people who find our approach and meaningful one area where think we are especially distinctive is failure believe we are the best place in the world to fail we have plenty of practice and failure and invention are inseparable to invent you have to experiment and if you know in advance that its going to work its not an experiment most large embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of necessary to get there outsized often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right given ten percent chance of payoff you should take that bet every time but still going to be wrong nine out of ten we all know that if you swing for the going to strike out lot but also going to hit some home the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most you can get is four in business every once in while when you step up to the plate you can score this long tailed distribution of is why its important to be bold big pay for so many and prime are all of bold at that worked and were fortunate to have those three big they have us grow into large company and there are certain that only large can do with tip of the hat to our no matter how good an entrepreneur you are not going to build an all composite in your garage not one youd want to fly in anyway used well our scale us to build for that we could otherwise never even contemplate but also if were not vigilant and thoughtful could slow us down and diminish our inventiveness as meet with across am continually amazed at the passion intelligence and creativity on display our accomplished lot in the last year and id like to share few of the of our to nourish and our three big prime and and while ill focus on those three assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding fourth prime we want prime to be such good value youd be irresponsible not to be member weve grown prime two day delivery selection from million to over million added delivery and free same day delivery on of of for in more than around the world weve added music photo storage the kindle library and streaming and prime now one hour delivery on an important subset of selection and was only days after it was up in that time small team built customer facing location for an urban warehouse determined which to sell got those and on staff tested designed for internal use both warehouse management system and driver facing and in time for the today just after that first city launch prime now is serving in more than around the world prime video from some of the most passionate we want brilliant like and spike lee to take and push our original series have already more than and won nearly golden globe and many of these are that might never have been told in the traditional linear model in the pipeline and coming soon are series and from like woody and the man in the high castle based on the dick novel an alternate history where the lost world war it on prime video on th and in four our most show acclaim from like the best drama of the season in the man in the high castle and the man in the high castle so much where most broadcast these days dont even try these are great for and they feed the prime flywheel prime who watch prime video are more likely to convert from free trial to membership and more likely to renew their annual finally our first ever prime day all our more tried prime that day than any other day in our history order growth over the same day the year before and whose are prime eligible through saw record breaking with growth prime become an all you can eat physical digital hybrid that love membership grew last year growth in the and even faster internationally and there are now of millions of theres good chance already one of them but if not please be responsible join prime we took two big and with and before we over ago we learned from our and stayed stubborn on the vision and today close to of sold on are sold by third party is great for because it unique selection and its great for there are over with of more than year selling on and over with that flywheel faster because inventory becomes prime eligible prime becomes more valuable for and sell more this year we program seller prime we who are able to meet high bar for shipping speed and consistency in service to be part of the prime program and ship their own at prime speed directly those have already seen significant bump in and the program led to of of additional that are available to prime via free two day or next day shipping in the and we also the program to help grow since the program weve provided aggregate of over billion to micro small and medium across the and japan through short term with total outstanding loan balance of about million surfer and owner of tower paddle is one beneficiary his business become one of the growing in san in part with little help from click to cash access to capital these small grow with greater selection and since our revenue along with the we hope to expand and are now working on ways to partner with so they can use their to take and manage the bulk of the credit risk in addition to nourishing our big we work to them our for anywhere to reach around the world in the past many would limit their customer base to their home country due to the practical of selling internationally to and expand the available to we built selling that in to reach in last year these cross are now nearly quarter of all third party sold on to make this possible we of millions of product and provided conversion among even small and niche can now tap into our global customer base and global logistics network the end result is very different from handling their own one at time cross fulfillment put it this way it really the paradigm when able to ship the goods in bulk to warehouse in or japan and have those goods be in one day or two days is another example of how we an offering like through customer obsession and passion for invention last year we ran program chai cart where we three wheeled mobile to navigate in business serve tea water and lemon juice to small business and teach them about selling in period of four the team traveled across of tea and engaged with over through this program and other with we found out there was lot of interest in selling but that with the belief that the process was time consuming tedious and complex so we which small to get in less than is specially designed studio on offering suite of launch registration and as well as basic seller training since its launch on th we have in were also fulfillment by the service to local customer needs in we program seller flex to combine logistics with selection at the local neighborhood level set aside part of their warehouse for to be sold on and we configure it as fulfillment in our network that can receive and fulfill customer our team guidance on warehouse layout it and operational infrastructure and the seller on standard operating to be weve now operational seller flex across ten web just over ago in the with its first major service simple storage service today more than for compute storage analytics mobile of and enterprise we also offer availability across geographic with another five and availability in canada china the and the to be available in the coming year with and and now is used by more than million from of every across nearly every industry like ge capital one intuit adobe and time is bigger than was at old growing at faster rate and most noteworthy in my view the pace of innovation to accelerate we significant and in increase over many as bold and unusual bet when we what does this have to do with selling we could have stuck to the knitting glad we didnt or did we maybe the knitting as much to do with our approach as the arena is customer inventive and experimental long term and deeply about operational excellence given and many that approach to rapidly expand into the most comprehensive widely adopted cloud service as with our retail business is made up of many small with single threaded rapid innovation the team out functionality almost daily across and that functionality just up for theres no many describe themselves as customer but few walk the walk most big technology are competitor they see what are doing and then work to fast follow in contrast to of what we build in is driven by what tell us they want good example is our engine aurora have been by the proprietary nature high cost and of traditional commercial grade and while many have moving toward more open like and they often struggle to get the performance they need us if we could eliminate that inconvenient trade off and thats why we built aurora it commercial grade durability and availability is fully compatible with up to better performance than the typical implementation but is th the price of the traditional commercial grade this struck resonant chord with and aurora is the growing service in the history of nearly this same story could be told about our data warehouse service which is the second growing service in history both small and large are moving their data to our approach to is also driven by our customer centric culture weve in many before there was any competitive pressure to do so in addition to price weve also continued to launch lower cost like aurora our business intelligence service container service our compute container service and lambda our server less capability while extending our to offer range of highly cost effective for running just about every type of application or it use case imaginable we even roll out and continuously improve like advisor which when they can save money resulting in of millions of in for our pretty sure were the only it vendor telling how to stop spending money with us whether you are yesterday or business that been around for the cloud is providing all of us with unbelievable to reinvent our add customer redeploy capital to fuel growth increase security and do all of this so much faster than before advanced media is an example of an customer that is constantly the customer experience technology is feature for baseball that the position of each player the and the ball as they move during every play on the field giving on any screen access to empirical data that age old like what could have if while also to life turning baseball into rocket science missile radar system to measure every more than per second and data in real time through kinesis our service for real time streaming data the data on and then analytics in the suite of will generate nearly of raw statistical data per game and up to per season shedding quantitative light on age old but never baseball of wisdom like never slide into first about seven ago that they were going to move all their to the cloud chose because it provided them with the scale and the set of and recently their cloud migration and like theirs are becoming increasingly common as like intuit and time have made to move all of their to is already good enough today to attract more than million and the service is only going to get better from here as the team their rapid pace of innovation well offer more and more to let build unfettered it will get easier and easier to collect store and analyze data well continue to add more geographic and well continue to see growth in mobile and connected device over time its likely that most will choose not to run their own data for the cloud instead invention machine we want to be large company thats also an invention machine we want to combine the extraordinary customer serving that are by with the speed of movement nimbleness and risk acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start can we do it optimistic we have good start on it and think our culture us in position to achieve the goal but dont think be easy there are some subtle traps that even high large can fall into as matter of course and well have to learn as an institution how to guard against them one common pitfall for large one that speed and inventiveness is one all decision making some are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible one way and these must be made methodically carefully slowly with great deliberation and consultation if you walk through and dont like what you see on the other side you cant get back to where you were before we can call these type but most arent like that they are changeable reversible theyre two way if youve made suboptimal type decision you dont have to live with the for that long you can reopen the door and go back through type can and should be made quickly by high judgment or small as get there to be tendency to use the heavy weight type decision making process on most many type the end result of this is unthoughtful risk aversion failure to experiment sufficiently and consequently invention well have to figure out how to fight that tendency and one all thinking will turn out to be only one of the well work hard to avoid it and any other large organization we can identify and social invention our growth fast twenty ago was driving to the post office in my chevy blazer and of in absolute as opposed to the past few have been especially significant weve grown from in to more than now were bit like who look around one day and realize their are grown you blink and it one thing thats exciting about our current scale is that we can put our inventive culture to work on moving the needle on and social two ago we set long term goal to use renewable energy across our global infrastructure weve since four significant wind and solar that will deliver million megawatt per the opposite situation is less interesting and there is undoubtedly some survivorship bias any that habitually use the light weight type decision making process to make type go extinct before they get large year of additional renewable energy into the electric that supply data wind farm fowler ridge already come we sustainable energy use across last year are on track to reach this year and are working on that will cover all of around the world our fulfillment well keep expanding our in like where our culture of invention led to big winner the frustration free program seven ago we the initiative with today there are more than globally in the program of millions of of excess material frustration free is customer delighter because the are easier to open its good for the planet because it less waste and its good for because with we ship less air and save on transportation we also continue to pioneer for like career choice leave share and ramp back career choice of tuition for that teach in demand regardless of whether those are relevant to career at well pay for nursing airplane mechanic and many were building with glass right in our fulfillment as way to encourage to participate in the program and to make it easy we see the impact through like single mother of eight who worked in one of our phoenix fulfillment career choice for to get licensed to drive an wheeler worked hard her and now long haul driver for schneider trucking and loving it this coming year were program to teach other interested the of career choice and how to implement it leave share and ramp back are that give flexibility with their growing leave share share their leave with their spouse or domestic partner if their employer doesnt offer leave ramp back birth additional control over the pace at which they return to work just as with our health care plan these are egalitarian theyre the same for our fulfillment and customer service as they are for our most senior renewable energy frustration free career choice leave share and ramp back are of culture that invention and long term thinking its very to think that our scale to create impact in these can tell you its great joy for me to get to work every day with team of such smart imaginative and passionate people on behalf of all of us at thank you for your support as as always attach copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day founder and chief executive officer letter to from the annual report to our many in by year end we had more than million yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the and if we execute well for today commerce money and precious time tomorrow through personalization commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery the to create real value for its and by doing so to create an enduring franchise even in established and large we have window of opportunity as marshal the to pursue the opportunity and as to are receptive to forming the competitive landscape continued to evolve at fast pace many large have with credible and have devoted substantial energy and to building awareness traffic and our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the commerce in other we see substantial opportunity in the large we are this strategy is not without risk it serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise its all about the long term we believe that fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly on capital our have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our continue to purchase from us on repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make and weigh differently than some accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our we will continue to make investment in light of long term market leadership rather than short term profitability or short term wall street we will continue to measure our and the effectiveness of our analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our and our we will make bold rather than timid investment where we see sufficient probability of gaining market leadership some of these will pay off will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between the appearance of our accounting and the present value of future cash well take the cash we will share our strategic thought with you when we make bold to the extent competitive allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually cost conscious culture particularly in business net we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to growth because we believe that scale is central to the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on and retaining versatile and talented and continue to weight their compensation to stock rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over from the beginning our focus been on offering our compelling value we that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer something they simply could not get any other way and serving them with we brought them much more selection than was possible in physical store our store would now occupy football and it in useful easy to search and easy to browse format in store open days year day we dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer gift shopping and vastly more content browsing and recommendation we dramatically further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our have in us repeat and word of mouth have combined to make the market leader in bookselling by many came long way in grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer grew from to increase the percentage of from repeat grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in of audience reach per media our web site went from rank of th to within the we established long term with many important strategic yahoo excite home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly traffic and service employee base grew from to and we significantly our management team distribution capacity grew from to square expansion of our and the launch of our second distribution in in rose to over at year end us to improve availability for our our cash and investment at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan us substantial strategic flexibility our the past success is the product of talented smart hard working group and take great pride in being part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to been and will continue to be the single most important element of success its not easy to work here when interview people tell them you can work long hard or smart but at you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that to our something that we can all tell our about such arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of whose and passion build for we are still in the early of learning how to bring value to our through commerce and our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this sustained investment in and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other may be prudent we also believe there are significant to better serve our overseas such as reducing delivery and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding ways to expand our business but in our we now know vastly more about commerce than when was but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain sense of urgency the and we will face to make our long term vision for reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth and execution risk the of product and geographic expansion and the need for large to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said bookselling and commerce in general should prove to be very large market and its likely that number of will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at are grateful to our for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our for their support and encouragement founder and chief executive officer
