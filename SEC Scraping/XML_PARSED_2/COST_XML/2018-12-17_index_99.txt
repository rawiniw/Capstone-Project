of since the annual meeting have not revealed significant about the structure or operation of the company compensation role of the compensation committee the and of compensation for our chief executive officer for other executive it the of the chief executive officer with which it generally the function is more fully above under of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee of messrs chair and and who in the committee authority under its charter to engage compensation but not used any the primary activity in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee of performance for to executive for the current fiscal year whether performance have been satisfied for during the prior fiscal year total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus program for the current fiscal year of of our executive compensation are equity compensation solely of performance based base salary cash and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation performance based performance based represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation the of employee with those of both in the shorter term with the one year performance and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention the committee view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership provide long term dimension to the equity base salary base salary is the second compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual cash bonus cash are relatively small component of compensation and subject to are at the discretion of the committee based on variety of metrics they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view generally lower than those at other in our peer group below under peer other consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company modest other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the and the deferred compensation these of compensation mix that are intended to reward shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent cash that are subject to one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the award vesting of up to five and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation and plan the committee that these do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by longer term equity that vest up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder in addition the corporate governance include claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation by improper peer fiscal the committee primarily considered executive compensation data from proxy for the following peer mart the home depot target corporation the company and this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these were selected because they are as successful and one of them the other major membership warehouse operator that was publicly for the whole fiscal year the committee took into account that one of the is substantially than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity fully based upon the achievement of performance and fully equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive to all executive are performance based with performance vesting over one year period time vesting over five and vesting for long service contingent upon employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance become time that subject to accelerated vesting for long service below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the four vesting of to non executive and is not performance based to the extent time vesting are

control none of or any other employee or had any change in control arrangement with the company for fiscal the committee performance based to which in value at the grant date an increase of over the prior fiscal year the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were and all of the were subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service cash for the chief executive officer have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal cash bonus of the bonus amount for was determined by the committee as one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company attainment of its tax income goal which was fully in fiscal and eligibility for the half was determined by percentage the amount of bonus received by other executive in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing to these executive are below with respect to the former half although the performance to payment he declined to receive it because of the determination that it had material weakness in internal control during the fiscal year related to ineffective information technology general the committee with request the criteria governing to other executive are below compensation of other executive most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was performance based to messrs and murphy were each the were based on the of and by the compensation committee before grant as noted above the performance criteria were and the executive all of the with accelerated vesting for long service and further time based vesting for other executive were based upon the recommendation of who on the amount of increase deserved over the prior salary level base salary for these up to over fiscal the executive other
