looking except as by law this management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal annual report on form previously with the sec overview we operate membership based on the concept that offering our low on limited selection of nationally branded and select private label in wide range of merchandise will produce high and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating by volume efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than traditional mass and we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is growth particularly comparable growth in open for at least one year comparable growth is through increasing the frequency with which our shop and the they spend on each visit can also be particularly by two that are beyond our control in currency exchange with respect to the consolidation of the of our international and in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive primarily domestic the higher our comparable exclusive of currency the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative reducing them as percentage of and profitability generating comparable growth is foremost question of making available to our the right merchandise at the right skill that we believe we have repeatedly over the long term another substantial factor in growth is the health of the in which we do business especially the united growth and gross are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread wide range of global national and regional and and department and specialty gasoline and based while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in our business to these such as through to our and to our merchandise mix increasing the penetration of our private label our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on that our can be but to maintain what we believe is perception among our of our providing the most competitive this may cause us for example to absorb in merchandise at certain rather than immediately passing them along to our negatively gross we also achieve growth by opening and to and better as our warehouse base available and desirable potential become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively less substantial component of growth however the negative of such growth lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign due to the smaller base in those and we expect that to continue our financial performance also heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area historically some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to to the compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and that they earn rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the income statement particularly gross and selling general and administrative can have substantial on net income our
