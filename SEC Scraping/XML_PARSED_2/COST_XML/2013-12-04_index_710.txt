the function is more fully above under of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee of chair and the committee authority under its charter to engage compensation but not used any the primary activity in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee of performance for to executive whether performance have been satisfied for during the prior fiscal year total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of of our executive compensation are equity compensation since fiscal solely of base salary cash and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation above to the of employee with those of both in the shorter term with the one year performance and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention the committee considered and comment by proxy advisory service that performance period longer than one year be adopted for performance its view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirement provide significant long term dimension to the equity base salary base salary is the second compensation component this compensation is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual with the exception of whose salary at the same level since cash bonus cash are relatively small component of compensation they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group below under peer other and consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company modest and other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the plan and the deferred compensation plan that the company does not have traditional retirement plan and that no executive any agreement to receive severance compensation table of foregoing of compensation combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the vesting over five of and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation plan and retirement plan the committee that these do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by longer term equity that vest over up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder during fiscal moreover the board the corporate governance to include claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that been by improper peer fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data from

not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity fully based upon the achievement of performance and when fully equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive in the board determined to replace the stock option award program with of since fiscal to all executive have been performance based with performance vesting over one year period time vesting over five and vesting for long service contingent upon the employment status at the vest date the board and the committee

certificate of incorporation and that call for greater than simple majority of voting proposal to change certain voting request that our board take the necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and that for greater than be and by requirement for the cast for and against applicable or simple compliance with applicable if necessary this the standard to the cast for and against such consistent with applicable supporting are willing to pay premium for of that have excellent corporate governance voting have been found to be one of six that are negatively related to company performance according to what in corporate governance by alma and of the law school are most often used to block by most but opposed by status quo management this proposal topic won from to support in waste management hill and the of these included ray and currently minority can frustrate the will of our shareholder to improve to our corporate governance this proposal should also be more favorably due to our in its corporate governance as in an independent investment research firm negatively our company for not an independent chairman the percentage of long tenure aging problem with board entrenchment and there was no non executive member of the audit committee who had substantial industry knowledge also negatively for no non executive director who had in risk management did not disclose specific performance of performance long term to for below par performance no policy and excessive pension our board continued to have large number of and non independent serving as our company was involved in many related party our board had the ability to issue blank check preferred stock and the authority to change its without shareholder approval our board displayed numerous lack of independence from management four company on the member board and our company engaged in numerous related party in addition to and executive chair and on our board to the core topic of this proposal from the context of our clearly improvable corporate climate please vote to protect shareholder value table of of response to proposal your board of that voting under our governance that require approval by greater than simple majority of voting is not in the best of our current voting our governing simple majority vote standard already to nearly all to shareholder vote as permitted by law our of incorporation provide that three require shareholder approval by more than simple majority vote approval by two of the outstanding is to amend the of incorporation regarding classification of the board which is the subject of proposal and amend the provision in the of incorporation dealing with removal of only for cause by majority of the outstanding is for to remove director the board that these protect and reduce unnecessary disruption of the company without unduly to act on important our have no separate requirement for voting greater than majority of voting the are do that the economic performance of the company or its to have been unsatisfactory or that the voting they challenge have actually the operating performance additionally several made by the are in the view simply the suggest that there is an excessive pension when in fact there is no pension at all similarly the mistakenly assert that there is no non executive director with in risk management in fact chair of our audit committee for many as vice chairman of company an owner of successful insurance and considerable risk management to the board finally the falsely state that the company no policy when in fact it does see page concerning the classified in the discussion below concerning proposal the board that the classified board and to serve the of the company and its accordingly it that change in voting that would dilute the force of this structure is undesirable concerning removal of only for cause our provide that director may be removed only for cause and only by approval of majority of the outstanding as opposed to simple majority of cast this is not vote standard cause is defined narrowly conviction of felony and such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal or gross negligence or dishonest conduct in the performance of director duty to the corporation by court and such adjudication is no longer subject to direct appeal may be removed for cause by the only at special meeting for that purpose which can be table of only by the board or by of record holding at least of the outstanding we believe that the current standard is in because it shareholder voice in very important yet highly unlikely event of vote on removing director for cause the current majority vote standard for removal of director for cause is not an impediment to other shareholder regarding are permitted to nominate director pursuant to article of our and can vote for certain each year at the annual meeting the board is to acting in the best of and acting are to acting in the best of the company and our and acting responsively to shareholder in august the board the to require that if in any uncontested election of nominee greater number of withhold than for the nominee will offer his or her resignation to the board committee of independent whose election is not at issue will determine and publicly report the action to be taken with respect to the resignation offer this policy enhanced the accountability of in addition following passage of shareholder proposal last year urging the board to take to eliminate classification of the board our board this year is providing with the opportunity to vote on proposal proposal to amend the of incorporation to phase out the classification of the board have consistently registered their approval of the board decision making re those who are also of the company by an average of nearly of the cast in the last three approval approval of this proposal would not itself amend the of incorporation the board must first authorize any to the and would then have to approve each of those with an affirmative vote of not less than two of the outstanding to vote generally in the election of for the set forth above your board of that proposal is not in the best of the company and its and unanimously that you vote against it proposal proposal to amend the of incorporation to change the method of since the company went public in its of incorporation have that be for three year and that approximately one third of the board are up for election every year the board that this classified board structure to the long term operational success and delivery of strong shareholder this proposal the opportunity to decide whether to amend the to change that well established structure and replace it with annual to declassify the board as further below the board is making no to voting for or against the amendment but each director advised the company that as shareholder he or she to vote proposal the model for shareholder value creation is grounded in board that is to for the long model long term approach to generate extraordinary growth of shareholder value the company is by who have made substantial commitment to the company by themselves to three year on the board the board that transitory in share price might be if were raised wages were cut were for onerous and the balance sheet were with leverage these are the that short term or table of term board might seek but board with its long term commitment to serving our determined that such would damage the long term value of the company by with and the classified structure of the board is an integral component of the model which proven its ability to return value to the current classified board structure sustained strong financial performance in the three since its founding grown to be the fourth retailer in the world with over around the globe net have grown at an rate of since wholesale was taken public in net income grown at an rate of over that same period total shareholder return which share price appreciation and been exemplary in addition to significant in the share price the board been vigilant in seeing capital returned to since the company raised its annual dividend from forty to and over billion of the in the company special cash dividend of over billion or per share the board is accountable to board history of good with and it is important that corporate be accountable to history that accountability include several ago the board adopted voting policy any board nominee who greater number of withhold than for in an uncontested election of to offer his or her resignation to the board and since that time our have been re with support from over of cast source market data as of note key comparable target and mart large cap best buy and table of each say on pay advisory vote the annual vote confirmed strong shareholder support for the compensation policy over support each year our executive are well below peer median and have been for many another key attribute of accountability is the right of of as few as of the company outstanding to call special meeting of this is relatively low threshold who think change may be the long term focus beyond the board and and company to develop the same long term relationship with its that it with the board working in the membership receive pay and more generous than their at this long term investment in its the company with greater loyalty and the company consequently through what it to be the employee turnover and the shrink inventory loss rate in the industry equity are meaningful portion of compensation for large number of more than and assistant in our membership in the united and vest over long up to five for senior management in fiscal over of compensation was in the form of equity executive individually have outright with valuation of up to million as of the record date long term view senior management confidence in their and that they do not need to seek short term gains in addition relative compensation indicate the senior management is generally well peer median the company is also for its long term approach to its through its in lower seeking to bring goods to market with the cost through expense control and minimal mark the company what it to be very strong reputation among its for offering low which the company authority the board and the company have consistently determined that instead of raising short term it is better to build loyalty among by charging lower that strategy in over of their and especially strong growth in member traffic in recent the no recommendation position of the board on the board of studied the potential and of for over ten various of with classified academic have the possibility that company with classified board might be less accountable to have lower firm valuation return lower gains to in the event of engage in value decreasing have lower sensitivity of compensation to performance and lower sensitivity of turnover to firm performance or have higher premium but with lower likelihood of an acquisition while these over the and that the may be relevant for many the board noted the gap between those adverse and the very positive of can see this gap for themselves they can look at the merger with the price company to see that board and management team with long term focus merger without laying off or only transitory gains they can look to the performance above and see that lower are not an issue at also can analyze executive compensation program and know that they are not dealing with board or management team that is insensitive to performance the board that significant benefit associated with classified board structure is that it as safeguard against short term for inconsistent with long term value table of the board that the classified structure could delay the success of an acquisition proposal that broad shareholder support but is opposed by the board the board also that there may be where the board and some do not agree about what full and fair acquisition proposal might be the board however that the risk of any value loss through delay in transaction in comparison to protection the structure against abusive or improvident tactics accordingly all board in their capacity as will be voting against the amendment based on the belief that classified board structure why is the board the proposal to believing the of classification of the board the the board opposed shareholder proposal calling for of our board at the annual meeting of although majority of voting disagreed with the recommendation they did so in far below the two of outstanding necessary to amend the provision in our of incorporation concerning the classified board following last meeting and prior to the amendment of the board and management with over of the outstanding as of the most recent quarter end to discuss about classified generally and the use of the structure at the company specifically these that some support annual and some support the current structure at in light of the prior and more recent information the board that should be the opportunity to vote on the to declassify the board law that for an amendment to the of incorporation to be adopted the board must recommend the amendment to the unless the board that because of conflict of interest or other special it should make no recommendation if permitted by the corporate statute the board would have provided the an opportunity to vote on the amendment but with recommendation that vote amendment because the board that the current structure to benefit instead the board is making no it that special exist while the board the matter to shareholder vote each director notified the company that he or she acting as shareholder to vote against the proposal the collectively own over two million as result the board determined to
