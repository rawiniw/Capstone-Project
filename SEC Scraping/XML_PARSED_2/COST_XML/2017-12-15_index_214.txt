any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of of our executive compensation are equity compensation solely of performance based base salary cash and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation performance based performance based represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation to the of employee with those of both in the shorter term with the one year performance and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention the committee view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership provide long term dimension to the equity base salary base salary is the second compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual cash bonus cash are relatively small component of compensation and subject to are at the discretion of the committee based on variety of metrics they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view generally lower than those at other in our peer group below under peer other consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company modest other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the and the deferred compensation these of compensation mix that are intended to reward shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent cash that are subject to one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the award vesting of up to five and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation and plan the committee that these do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by longer term equity that vest up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder in addition the corporate governance include claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that been by improper peer fiscal the committee primarily considered executive compensation data from proxy for the following peer mart the home depot target corporation the company and this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these were selected because they are as successful and one of them the other major membership warehouse operator that is publicly the committee took into account that one of the is substantially than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity fully based upon the achievement of performance and fully equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive to all executive are performance based with performance vesting over one year period time vesting over five and vesting for long service contingent upon employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction

the model for shareholder value creation is grounded in long term approach that the classified board structure this model been proven to return value as sustained strong financial performance under its classified board the classified board structure is designed to safeguard against short term for inconsistent with long term value creation the article by the proponent recent finding that classified do not negatively impact firm value the model is grounded in board that is to long term model long term approach to generate growth in shareholder value the company is by who have themselves to three year on the board the board that transitory in share price might be if were raised wages were cut were for onerous and the balance sheet were with significant leverage these are that short term or short term board might seek but the board with its long term commitment focus determined that such would damage the long term value of the company by with and the model proven its

in some of the may be relevant for some the board noted the gap between those adverse and the very positive of under the company classified structure the board to believe that the classified board structure as safeguard against short term for inconsistent with long term value creation the board that the classified structure could delay the success of an acquisition proposal that broad shareholder support but is opposed by the board the board also that there may be where the board and some do not agree about what full and fair acquisition proposal might be the board however that the risk of any value loss through delay in transaction is by the protection that the structure against abusive or improvident tactics the current voting standard broad shareholder support before fundamental change is adopted that could impact the mission and long term recent find that the classified board structure does not have negative impact on firm value the proponent paper that voting and classified negatively impact firm and shareholder the proponent however to recognize relevant subsequent research literature and debate specifically the value of more recent on that had their found that is associated with either decline in firm value or had no significant impact on firm value these sparked response that was also as evidence that firm declined after at targeted by the
