on executive compensation was in favor the committee determined not to make any to the compensation as result of the vote compensation by the committee for the executive for fiscal are not materially from those for the prior year as part of grant for fiscal the committee reduced the number of for nearly all of the board of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board experienced grant of executive experienced reduction for most other the reduction was or the were taken in light of the substantial share price appreciation that since the inception of the program in role of the

above under of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee of chair and the committee authority under its charter to engage compensation but not used any the primary activity in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee of performance for to executive whether performance have been satisfied for during the prior fiscal year total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of of our executive compensation are equity compensation since fiscal solely of and since fiscal solely of performance based base salary cash and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation performance based performance based represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation above to the of employee with those of both in the shorter term with the one year performance and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention the committee view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirement provide significant long term dimension to the equity table of salary base salary is the second compensation component this compensation is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual cash bonus cash are relatively small component of compensation and subject to are at the discretion of the committee based on variety of metrics they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group below under peer other and consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company modest and other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the plan and the deferred compensation plan that the company does not have traditional retirement plan the foregoing of compensation combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the award vesting of up to five and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation plan and retirement plan the committee that these do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by longer term equity that vest up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder during fiscal moreover the board the corporate governance to include claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that been by improper peer fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data from proxy for the following peer mart the home depot target corporation the company and this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these were selected because they all are as successful and one of them the other major membership warehouse operator that is publicly in the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the is substantially than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity fully based upon the achievement of performance and fully equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive in the board determined to replace the stock option award program with of since fiscal to all executive have been performance based with performance vesting over one year period time vesting over five and vesting for long service contingent upon the employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance become time that subject to accelerated vesting for long service below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest table of each of the four vesting of to non executive and is not performance based to the extent time vesting are met are settled and in of common stock net of withheld for minimum statutory

over period of time the company does not maintain pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any executive officer the company also the executive with certain car allowance the committee the and are modest and consistent with its overall objective of and retaining highly qualified executive compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the addition to considering the
