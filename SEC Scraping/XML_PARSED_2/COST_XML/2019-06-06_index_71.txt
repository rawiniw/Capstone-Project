turnover when combined with the operating by volume efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse these and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than most other we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is growth particularly comparable growth we define comparable as from open

another substantial factor in growth is the health of the in which we do business the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united growth and gross are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across wide range of global national and table of and those with commerce while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in our business to these such as through to our and to our merchandise mix increasing the penetration of our private label and through our our

initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are to decline in significance as they relate to the of our total our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign due to the smaller base in those and we expect that to continue our commerce business growth domestically and internationally also our our membership format is an integral part of

increase the penetration of our executive and sustain high renewal materially our profitability our membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse occur in as to our financial performance heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and rather we believe that reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the income statement
