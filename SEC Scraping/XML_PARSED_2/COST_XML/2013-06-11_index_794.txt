handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross than traditional mass and we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is growth particularly comparable growth we report comparable as in open for at least one year and comparable growth is through increasing the frequency with which our shop and the that

believe that we have in this area historically some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to to the compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and that they earn rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the income statement
