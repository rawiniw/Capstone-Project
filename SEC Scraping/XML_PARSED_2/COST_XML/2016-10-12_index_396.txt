through increasing shopping frequency from and and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket can also be particularly by certain that are beyond our control in currency exchange with respect

of our selling general and administrative reducing them as percentage of and profitability generating comparable growth is foremost question of making available to our the right merchandise at the right skill that we believe we have repeatedly over the long term another substantial factor in growth is the health of the in which we do business especially the united growth and gross are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across wide range of global national and regional and while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or in

business higher penetration of gasoline will generally lower our gross percentage rapidly gasoline may significantly impact our near term net growth generally rising gasoline benefit net growth which given the higher base negatively our gross percentage but our selling general and administrative as percentage of net decline in gasoline the inverse effect we also achieve growth by opening as our

however lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are increasingly less significant relative to the of our total our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign due to the smaller base in those and we expect that to continue our business growth both domestically and internationally also our our membership format is an integral part

base increase penetration of our executive and sustain high renewal materially our profitability our financial performance heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area

wages and rather we believe that table of discussion and analysis of financial condition and of in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass
