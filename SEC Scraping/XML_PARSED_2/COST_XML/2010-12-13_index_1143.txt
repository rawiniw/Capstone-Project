the chief financial officer the three other most highly who were serving as executive at the end of fiscal and one former executive officer the executive our executive for fiscal were chief executive officer chairman of the board president and chief operating officer former senior executive vice president and chief operating officer who retired during fiscal executive vice president chief financial officer executive vice president coo eastern and and executive vice president coo southwest and compensation philosophy and our compensation are designed to motivate all our and to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company it been very successful in and retaining quality low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the compensation have historically to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee that it been desirable to continue compensation that have been persistent at the company for number of the compensation by the committee for the executive for fiscal are not materially from those for the prior year the committee that the company well in light of the economic role of the compensation committee the committee the and of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive it the of the chief executive officer with which it generally the function is more fully above under of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee of three chair and the committee authority under its charter to engage compensation but not used of any kind the primary activity in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee of performance for to executive whether performance have been satisfied for during the prior fiscal year total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of compensation the of our executive compensation are equity compensation since fiscal solely of base salary discretionary cash bonus program and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and modest the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which been to make equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not extensively this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation above to the of employee with those of both in the short term with the performance and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second compensation component payment of fixed cash compensation is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable level of cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual with the exception of messrs and whose have at the same level since cash bonus discretionary cash are and have been relatively small component of compensation they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group below under peer other and consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company traditionally sought to have modest and other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the plan and the deferred compensation plan that the company does not have traditional retirement plan and that no executive any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing of compensation combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent discretionary cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the vesting over five of and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation plan match the committee that the executive compensation do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by long term equity that vest over up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder peer for fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data from proxy for the following peer mart the home depot target corporation wholesale club and these were selected because they all are as successful and two of them represent the two other major membership warehouse in the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the is substantially than the company the committee does not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensation if fully based upon the achievement of performance equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive during fiscal the board of determined to replace all stock option with of since fiscal all to executive have been performance based these generally vest over five contingent upon the employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement to foster motivation on the part of to improve the of the company over the longer term following satisfaction of performance become time that in the absence of accelerated vesting for long service below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the four vesting of to other and in fiscal was not performance based to the extent time vesting are met are settled and in of common stock prior to vesting are not to vote or receive on unvested beginning in fiscal all and who receive are eligible for accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have long service with the company vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant after of service vesting after of service and vesting after of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the vesting period interim vesting for long service can occur in the case of certain for prior to for fiscal were made on and the performance criteria for the were established in the criteria were increase versus fiscal of total or income with both based on local currency for the criteria were increase versus fiscal in total or income with both based on local currency after the end of fiscal the committee determined that the were accordingly the executive all of the subject to time based and long service vesting all executive received accelerated vesting for long service for portion of these with further time based vesting on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in fixed date of for the policy for as in advance by the committee no such exception been to date except to permit grant to in connection with his joining the board in all in fiscal were made under the fifth stock incentive plan by the and the only equity plan by the company other compensation the company the executive with the to all other in most the cost of these small percentage of each total compensation key include vacation for long term disability insurance matching contribution and discretionary plan contribution and the payment of for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly the executive the plan that certain percentage of an maybe by the company subject to certain this match will vest over period of time the company does not maintain pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any executive officer the company also the executive with certain car allowance the committee the and are modest and consistent with its overall objective of and retaining highly qualified executive compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the compensation generally the committee executive compensation and on the compensation for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these are critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee written employment contract for which was the same as his contract for the prior fiscal year the contract term was for the fiscal year unless otherwise in accordance with its but is renewable from year to year it for base salary of it further for cash bonus of up to determined by the board or the committee and award determined by the board or the committee the company the right to terminate for cause and he the right to terminate the agreement on days notice who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee with the agreement of messrs and them similarly for compensation owing to the in their historical and current to the success of the company apart from the change in control provision in the equity plan applicable to all neither nor any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee performance based to each of messrs and the same number for the prior fiscal year did not request any change in the of the award versus the prior year and the committee did not otherwise believe change was warranted the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance and all of the were subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base of messrs and have been since fiscal cash have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal messrs and each were cash of in fiscal there are no fixed criteria applied by the committee in considering the amount of these generally to the committee the bonus he is appropriate historically he modest seeking to link his bonus as percentage of that eligible amount stated in his employment contract to by generally eligible for the this year the company its internal net income goal and were eligible to receive the bonus award component associated with this goal essentially of the eligible bonus amount to the committee bonus for other executive that were approximately of eligible inclusive of the net income goal he bonus for himself in the same proportion accordingly bonus of of the eligible amount in his employment agreement the committee this request and an equal award for the committee that cash to chief executive at some peer are substantially higher the committee however to respect desire to receive modest compensation in part because it that higher would not change motivation and performance the committee in the past and to believe that messrs and are underpaid the committee also noted that messrs and have for many had direct and indirect economic in of the company which further their with the compensation of other executive as noted above the most significant component of the compensation of the executive is the award in fiscal of performance based to messrs and were and respectively the were based on the of and were the same as in fiscal as noted above the performance criteria were and the executive all of the subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as above for other executive were based upon the recommendation of who on the amount of increase deserved over the prior salary level salary up to over fiscal bonus the executive other than messrs and received discretionary cash ranging from approximately to approximately from the prior year bonus criteria were by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of after the close of the fiscal year bonus to the committee of of potential the committee the discretion to vary from recommendation but historically deferred to it as it did this fiscal year as with all other roughly of the bonus potential was due to the attainment of its internal net income target for fiscal eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the net income target was determined based on relevant to the
