efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse these and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than most other we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is growth particularly comparable warehouse comparable growth we define comparable as from open for more than one year and as well

certain that are beyond our control in currency exchange with respect to the consolidation of the of our international and in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive primarily our and the higher our comparable exclusive of these the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative reducing them as percentage of and profitability generating comparable growth is foremost question of making available to our the right merchandise at the right skill that we believe we have repeatedly over the long term another substantial factor in growth is the health of the in

on to our all negatively near term gross as percentage of net gross percentage we believe that our gasoline business but it generally significantly lower gross percentage relative to our non gasoline business higher penetration of gasoline will generally lower our gross percentage rapidly gasoline may significantly impact our near term net growth generally rising gasoline benefit net growth which given the higher base negatively our gross percentage but our selling general and administrative as percentage of net decline in gasoline the inverse effect we also achieve growth by opening as our warehouse base available and desirable potential become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative of such growth however lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are increasingly less significant relative to the of our total our rate of square footage growth is

increase penetration of our executive and sustain high renewal materially our profitability our financial performance heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area historically some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to to the compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and that they earn rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the income statement particularly gross and selling general and
