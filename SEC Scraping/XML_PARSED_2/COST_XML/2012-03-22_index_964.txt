page of our fiscal form the have produced significantly higher revenue and operating income growth as to the the primary factor driving the disparate growth in our as to our was the effect of in the

canada total revenue growth operating income growth comparable growth local currency throughout our through we refer to the impact of in foreign relative to the dollar which are to the between the

state that foreign against the dollar which positively impacted net and membership during by approximately and respectively of this combined positive impact resulting from in foreign on consolidated total revenue was attributable to the strengthening of the dollar while we do not agree that providing separate operating for canada for each item in would be helpful to material in particular might

exchange commission march response in our form for fiscal page we that gross as percent of net basis the majority of this impact or basis was due to an million lifo inventory charge in as disclosed this charge from higher for our merchandise primarily food and sundries and gasoline in our first fiscal quarter of page the basis point decline in was due primarily to penetration of our lower gasoline business resulting from increase in the average price per gallon page there was no lifo inventory charge in the first quarter of fiscal we will continue to discuss the impact of significant lifo which are indicative of inflationary or deflationary and their impact on our gross in our most recent form for the second fiscal quarter ended with the sec on march we expanded our quantitative summary table to include merchandise within our gross discussion the table more clearly that gross is calculated by merchandise or cost of goods sold from net our quantitative summary table is as ended ended net less merchandise gross gross as percent of net given the relationship between the effects that in merchandise have on in net we continue to believe that an analysis of the in gross best the necessary information to understand in merchandise the gross metric gross as percent of net is the primary tool used by our management in its analysis of merchandise and we believe the one most used by our and many of the equity research who provide written research on wholesale and other to their client in addition review of the ten sec filings will show that they too discuss gross or gross profit and do not have separate discussion related to merchandise or cost of by expanding our disclosure as we have done in our second quarter form we have provided additional information to more clearly understand the relationship between merchandise and net and the resulting impact on source mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission march note summary of significant accounting page page we note your response to our prior comment tell us whether the you into to mitigate the cost of energy used for your and other can be net settled or are to be net settled and tell us if you have ever net settled any of the if so explain to us how you consider the guidance under and in your assessment on whether they qualify for the normal purchase and sale scope exception for electricity please also advise us how you consider the additional criteria under paragraph of in whether they qualify for the scope exception response and relate to the probability of physical settlement and require that for derivative contract to qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception it must be probable at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will not settle net and will result in physical delivery the exception shall not be applied to contract that cash of gains or or otherwise settle gains or periodically because those are net at wholesale when electricity or natural gas energy forward contract becomes effective it is for qualification of the scope exception included in topic through when we enter into fixed or variable priced we intend to take physical delivery all of the are considered for accounting as understood in topic given that each determinable quantity based upon our estimate of future historical energy usage data typically the past two to three these prohibit resale of any energy to third party net settlement is not or and physical delivery of in the throughout the term of the is considered probable at inception we do not have history of net settling these however there have been rare isolated where our energy consumption for discrete period of time was less than the minimum determinable quantity included in the contract the net settlement would occur only for the quantity shortage between the actual energy physically and any stated minimum energy quantity threshold for discrete period of time during the contract period if applicable not the total energy quantity physically any net settlement would represent small percentage of the physical under an individual contract and would be considered by us to be isolated notwithstanding these rare we continue to believe that physical delivery is probable throughout the term of the as in our fixed priced energy additional energy physically above the determinable contracted are at the current market price on the date of delivery of these the optionality quantity feature to the purchase of additional energy above the determinable does not provide us benefit beyond the assurance of energy supply for use in the normal course of our business in variable priced for physical delivery of energy is based on current market in your comment you have specifically that we advise you of how we considered the criteria under in how we qualify for the scope exception for our forward to purchase electricity our electricity are considered power purchase as the term is understood in topic we note that paragraph which specifically to qualification of the scope exception for power purchase or sale that are capacity defined in topic as an agreement by an owner of capacity to sell the right to that capacity to another party so that it can satisfy its for example in the electric industry capacity sometimes to as capacity is the capability to deliver electric power to the electric transmission system of an operating control area mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission march whether an option contract is capacity contract or traditional option contract is matter of judgment and our judgment been that our are not capacity otherwise to qualify for the scope exception under paragraph

electricity needs of our electricity customer base electricity between wholesale as large retail buyer and an electricity provider could not meet the requirement of paragraph related to statutory or contractual obligation forward with optionality for the purchase of electricity that do not meet this criterion of paragraph are nevertheless eligible to qualify for the scope exception by meeting all the in through satisfying paragraph that the company does not have history of net settlement satisfying through that where the electricity have optionality in quantity that the additional are bought or sold at market as in our response to you we believe that we have met all of the of through to be able to designate our electricity as meeting the scope exception in any event our fixed price energy
