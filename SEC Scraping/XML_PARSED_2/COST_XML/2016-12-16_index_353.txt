efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse these and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than most other we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is growth particularly comparable warehouse comparable growth we define comparable as from open for more than one year and as well

effect we also achieve growth by opening as our warehouse base available and desirable potential become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative of such growth however lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are increasingly less significant relative to the of

our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry
