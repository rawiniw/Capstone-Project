executive vice president coo eastern and and executive vice president coo southwest and compensation philosophy and our compensation are designed to motivate our and to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company it been very successful in and retaining quality low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the compensation have historically to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee that it been desirable to continue compensation that have been persistent at the company for number of at the annual meeting the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation was in favor the committee considered the of the advisory shareholder vote and determined not to make any to our compensation in response to the vote the compensation by the committee for the executive for fiscal are not materially from those for the prior year except for the associated with the chief executive officer transition role of the compensation committee the committee the and of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive it the of the chief executive officer with which it generally the function is more fully above under of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee of chair and the committee authority under its charter to engage compensation but not used any the primary activity in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee of performance for to executive whether performance have been satisfied for during the prior fiscal year total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of compensation the of our executive compensation are equity compensation since fiscal solely of base salary discretionary cash bonus program and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and modest the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave table of contents more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation above to the of employee with those of both in the short term with the performance and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second compensation component this compensation is consistent with the need for executive to have predictable level of cash compensation which been subject generally to modest annual with the exception of whose salary at the same level since and whose salary the same from until he stepped down from the role of in at which point his salary was reduced in both they received slightly higher in fiscal with fiscal year cash bonus discretionary cash are relatively small component of compensation they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group below under peer other and consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company modest and other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the plan and the deferred compensation plan that the company does not have traditional retirement plan and that no executive any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing of compensation combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent discretionary cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the vesting over five of and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation plan and retirement plan the committee that these do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by long term equity that vest over up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained performance that is with shareholder table of contents peer for fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data from proxy for the following peer mart the home depot target corporation the company and this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal except that the company was added to replace wholesale club which to be publicly company in these were selected because they all are as successful and one of them the other major membership warehouse operator in the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the is substantially than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid or other specific quantitative of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensation if fully based upon the achievement of performance and when fully equity compensation is the component of compensation for executive in the board of determined to replace the stock option award program with of since fiscal to all executive have been performance based with performance vesting over one year period time vesting over five and vesting for long service contingent upon the employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance become time that in the absence of accelerated vesting for long service below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the four vesting of to non executive and is not performance based to the extent time vesting are met are settled and in of common stock net of withheld for tax are not to vote or receive

of certain for prior to the performance criteria for the performance based were increase versus fiscal of total or income with both based on local currency after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both were accordingly the executive all of the subject to time based and long service vesting all executive received accelerated vesting for long service for portion of these with further time based vesting on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in fixed date of for the policy for as in advance by the committee for fiscal were made on with the exception of the grant to in see note on page and the performance criteria for the were established in all in fiscal were made under the fifth stock incentive compensation plan by the and the only equity plan by the company table of contents other compensation the company the executive with the to all other in most the cost of these small percentage of each total compensation key include vacation for long term

the benefit of certain highly the executive the plan that certain percentage of an maybe by the company subject to certain this match will vest over period of time the company does not maintain pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any executive officer the company also the executive with certain car allowance the committee the and are modest and consistent with its overall objective of and retaining highly qualified executive compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the compensation generally the committee executive compensation and on the compensation for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee written employment for and related to their service during fiscal as chief executive officer the contract term for was for the period of time from the beginning of the fiscal year through the contract term for was for through the end of the fiscal year the provided for to get pro rata portion of his annual base salary of and to receive pro rata portion of his

committee and an award determined by the board or the committee who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee similarly to the chief executive officer for compensation apart from the change in control provision in the equity plan applicable to all below under potential upon termination or change in control none of messrs or any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee performance based to the same number for the prior fiscal year was performance based consistent with the amount to in his role as prior to fiscal when at his own request received smaller grant of performance based for fiscal was one third of his prior year grant of in proportion to the amount of time during fiscal which he as the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were met and all of the were subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base of and have been since fiscal for fiscal received lower salary than in prior as result of stepping down as chief executive officer on received base salary of for fiscal cash have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal was cash bonus of in fiscal while table of contents received cash bonus of and received that were determined in part according to their length of service in their respective during the year the bonus for messrs and were determined by the committee as half of bonus eligibility was determined by whether the company had its tax income goal which was in fiscal eligibility for the half was determined by percentage the amount of bonus received by other executive in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing to these executive are below compensation of other executive as noted above the most significant component of the compensation in fiscal is the award of performance based to messrs and were each the were based on the of and were the same as in fiscal as noted above the performance criteria were and the executive all of the subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as above for other executive were based upon the recommendation of who on the amount of increase deserved over the prior salary level base salary up to over fiscal after for the length of the fiscal fiscal actually up to fiscal as result of the week fiscal as to the normal week fiscal year the executive other than messrs and received discretionary cash ranging from approximately to approximately relatively flat as to the prior year bonus criteria were by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of after the close of the fiscal year bonus to the committee of approximately of the targeted amount the committee the discretion to vary from the chief executive recommendation but historically deferred to it as it did this fiscal year as with all other roughly of the bonus potential was due to the attainment of its internal tax income target for fiscal eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the tax income target was determined based on relevant to the executive area of responsibility for those whose are operational the related to controllable inventory shrinkage and profit in their of responsibility for those whose are primarily the related to gross inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their of responsibility for those whose combine operational and the related to combination of those above and for those whose are staff the related to combination of company wide operational and in addition to qualitative relevant to their of responsibility for each officer there is also component not linked to
