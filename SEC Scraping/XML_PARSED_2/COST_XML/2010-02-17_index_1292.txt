and how each element of compensation into your overall compensation plan assistant director united and exchange commission response we believe that the compensation discussion and analysis taken as whole substantially covered these nevertheless in future to the extent consistent with as they exist at the time of filing we will consolidate and supplement this discussion and analysis to further clarify the of the compensation program what the compensation program is designed to reward why we choose to pay each element of the program and how each element of compensation into our overall compensation plan of the compensation program we have the of the compensation program in different of the along with the of the program such as historic to the financial and competitive success of the company that we also consider for example on page of the proxy statement under compensation philosophy and we the of the program our compensation are designed to motivate all our and to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company it been very successful in and retaining quality low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the compensation have historically to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee that it been desirable to continue compensation that have been persistent at the company for number of on page of the proxy statement we the of the performance based program the board of the switch to because it that the the of employee and in addition it is that the five year vesting assistant director united and exchange commission requirement to foster motivation on the part of to improve the of the company over the longer term also on page of the proxy statement we further the of the compensation program the value of the compensation payable to the executive is significantly tied to the performance and the return to its the committee that its compensation will allow the company to continue to attract and retain management team what the compensation program is designed to reward to further describe what the compensation program is designed to reward we will to the extent consistent with as they exist at the time of future filings provide additional analysis along the following in addition to current cash compensation and these combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of for executive being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent discretionary cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the vesting over five of share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit deferred compensation the are the dominant feature of compensation which the committee is key element for alignment between the of and the of the company and its particularly sustained appreciation in the price of common stock why we choose to pay each element of compensation we believe the analysis of why we choose to pay each assistant director united and exchange commission element of compensation is adequately under element of compensation on page of the proxy statement the following discussion generally to compensation for all executive based largely on historical of the company the of our compensation are base salary discretionary cash bonus program equity compensation since the fourth quarter of fiscal solely of of and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group and the company great emphasis in the compensation for the executive on equity incentive compensation the committee did not extensively this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation how each element of compensation into our overall compensation plan we believe that the analysis of how each element of compensation into our overall compensation plan is adequately in the excerpt from page of the proxy statement above we note your discussion on page regarding discretionary cash to your executive other than messrs and you state that roughly of the bonus potential was not due to the failure to attain its internal net income target and that eligibility for the remainder of the cash bonus was based on relevant to the executive area of responsibility it does not appear that you provided quantitative discussion of the of these and if you this information because you believe it would result in competitive harm please tell us your please also discuss how assistant director united and exchange commission difficult it will be going forward to achieve the target and goal or other please refer to instruction to item of regulation and compliance and disclosure interpretation regulation question available on our at sec response the company that disclosure of the of the and associated with the discretionary cash bonus program for executive other than messrs and is not under item and instruction to item of regulation or the guidance in compliance and disclosure interpretation regulation question because the performance are not material either in the context of the executive compensation or or otherwise as detailed below no single performance goal of the multiple that inform the bonus program over separate metrics among the five executive who participate in the program is material to an understanding of the compensation or understand that an fact is generally considered to be material for of the federal if there is substantial likelihood that instruction to item of regulation that the purpose of is to provide material information that is necessary to an understanding of the compensation regarding the executive emphasis added instruction to item of regulation disclosure of current or future performance to the extent that the are material to an understanding of executive officer compensation for the last fiscal year emphasis added similarly the answer to question of the compliance disclosure of regulation that company should begin its analysis of whether it is to disclose performance by the threshold question of materiality in the context of the executive compensation or if performance are not material in this context the company is not to disclose the performance emphasis added assistant director united and exchange commission reasonable shareholder would consider it important exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no note that in my experience and have not disclosure of the target of performance established in connection with the annual bonus program also understand that an fact is moreover generally considered to be material only if there was substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the fact would have been by the reasonable investor as significantly the total mix of information made available basic at thus the multiple for the cash bonus program must be in the context of the executive compensation and the and of compensation received by the executive in question and the discretionary of the bonus program the company does not view cash as significant part of its overall executive compensation program the proxy statement on page that the executive compensation program equity compensation in view of relatively low and cash to its peer accordingly the amount of the cash is small relative to total cash compensation and total compensation there are five executive covered in the compensation tables for whom the metrics in question are directly pertinent total compensation from the summary compensation table for fiscal the of bonus to total compensation were and year over year in the total amount of cash have also been small for the three reflected in the table the difference between the highest and to an individual officer the absolute amount of the could be in year when the company also the income target but it is likely that that target would occur in the context of equity but even doubling of these would not indicate that the represent material portion of total compensation assistant director united and exchange commission is less than and in most the difference is significantly less even if the total bonus could be material none of the individual that inform the amount of the cash is material because no single metric would account for more than half of the bonus potential and most account for only around as disclosed on page of the proxy statement the cash bonus are function of at least five different of metrics in addition to an internal income target which for roughly of the bonus potential the bonus for fiscal year was determined based on relevant to the executive area of responsibility for those whose are operational the related to controllable inventory shrinkage and profit in their of responsibility for those whose are primarily the related to gross inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their of responsibility for those whose combine operational and the related to combination of those above and for those whose are staff the related to combination of company wide operational and in addition to qualitative relevant to their of in addition to the small portion each individual in the overall bonus program the lower value metrics are not uniform across the entire population of executive covered by the tables thus disclosure of all the quantitative metrics would give clutter rather than clarity the company half half that is if the maximum amount of the component is of the bonus is based upon company income target which alone among the metrics is the same for all the in question beyond that there is great variation among the metrics applied for two primary for those with across the entire company geographically and metrics are company wide for those with geographically the metrics are regionally based based on one data set for canada and another for assistant director united and exchange commission the eastern united and based on data set for part of the united in addition some are primarily by operational metrics while the remainder have metrics that are department and there is solely qualitative element of the bonus for each executive that no associated metrics thus apart from the company income target and the non quantitative component there are more than twenty different metrics that can influence the cash for these five the most significant of which for no more than in fiscal clearly no one of these can be material to an understanding of the compensation and further evidence of the immateriality of any individual metric of the cash bonus plan is the discretionary nature of the program as noted on page of the proxy statement the cash bonus are discretionary and are as such in the bonus column of the summary compensation table the discretion at two the the initial determination as to the amount of the cash he to recommend to the compensation committee of the board of the compensation committee discretion to vary from recommendation although it rarely that discretion the amount of the cash after discretionary and subjective evaluation of company and executive officer performance in at the beginning of the fiscal year he is not bound to recommend the payment any specific amount based on achievement of any established for example as noted there was an income target in fiscal that was not met nevertheless had the discretion to recommend to the compensation committee the full amount of the potential cash bonus associated with this target known as the company half to award some fraction not necessarily in proportionate fashion or none at all he chose in this particular year to award none at all in addition as noted above substantial component of the cash any quantitative framework based on the foregoing we believe that it is appropriate for the company to refrain from the assistant director united and exchange commission for each of the different metrics that comprise the bonus program form for the quarterly period ended please comply with the above in your future quarterly filings to the extent applicable
