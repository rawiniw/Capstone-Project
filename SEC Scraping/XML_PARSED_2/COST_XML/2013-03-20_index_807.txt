operate profitably at significantly lower gross than traditional mass and we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is growth particularly comparable growth we report

consistently providing the most competitive this may cause us for example to absorb in merchandise at certain rather than immediately passing them along to our negatively gross we also achieve growth

substantial component of growth however the negative of such growth lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign due to the smaller base in those and we expect that to continue our financial performance also heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area historically some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to to the compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and that they earn rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the income statement particularly gross and selling general and
