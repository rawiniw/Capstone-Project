will produce high and rapid inventory turnover when combined with the operating by volume efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse these and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than most other we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is growth particularly comparable growth we define comparable as from open for more than one year and as well as related to commerce operating for more than one year comparable growth is through increasing shopping frequency from and and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket can also be particularly by certain that are beyond our control in currency exchange with respect to the consolidation of the of our

holding steady despite cost instead of passing the on to our negatively near term gross as percentage of net gross percentage we believe that our gasoline business but it generally significantly lower

generally rising gasoline benefit net growth which given the higher base negatively our gross percentage but our selling general and administrative as percentage of net decline in gasoline the inverse
