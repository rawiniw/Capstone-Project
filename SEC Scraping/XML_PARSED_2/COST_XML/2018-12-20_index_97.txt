by volume efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no self service warehouse these and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross net less merchandise than most other we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is growth particularly comparable warehouse comparable growth we define comparable as from open for more than one year and as well as related to commerce operating for more than one year comparable growth is through increasing shopping frequency from and and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket can also be particularly by certain that are beyond our control in currency exchange with respect to the consolidation of the of our international in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive and the implementation of the revenue recognition standard the higher our comparable exclusive of these the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative reducing them as percentage of and profitability generating comparable growth is foremost question of making available to our the right merchandise at the right skill that we believe we have repeatedly over the long term another substantial factor in growth is the health of the in which we do business the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united growth and gross are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous table of widespread across wide range of global national and regional and those with commerce while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in our business to these such as through to our and to our merchandise mix increasing the penetration of our private label and through our our philosophy is to provide our with quality goods and at competitive we do not focus in the short term on but instead seek to maintain what we believe is perception among our of our authority on quality goods consistently providing the most competitive our in merchandise can from time to time include reducing on merchandise to drive or meet competition and holding steady despite cost instead of passing the on to our all negatively near term gross as percentage of net gross percentage we believe that our gasoline business but it generally significantly lower gross percentage relative to our non gasoline business higher penetration of gasoline will generally lower our gross percentage rapidly gasoline may significantly impact our near term net growth generally rising gasoline benefit net growth which given the higher base negatively our gross percentage but our selling general and administrative as percentage of net decline in gasoline the inverse effect we also achieve growth by opening as our warehouse base available and desirable potential become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative of such growth however lower initial operating profitability relative to and cannibalization of at when occur in are to decline in significance as they relate to the of our total our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign due to the smaller base in those and we expect that to continue our commerce business growth domestically and internationally also our our membership format is an integral

performance heavily on our ability to control while we believe that we have in this area some significant are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility with respect to to the compensation of our our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and rather we believe that our longer term of reducing employee turnover and employee satisfaction compensation that are better than the industry average for much of our this may cause us for example to absorb that other might seek to pass through to their because our business is on very low modest in various in the
