in currency exchange with respect to the consolidation of the of our international and in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive primarily our and the higher our comparable exclusive of these the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative reducing them as percentage of and profitability generating comparable growth is foremost question of making available to our
