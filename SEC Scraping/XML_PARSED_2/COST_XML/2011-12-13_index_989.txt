designed to motivate our and to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company it been very successful in and retaining quality low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the compensation have historically to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee that it been desirable to continue compensation that have been persistent at the company for number of table of contents the compensation by the committee for the executive for fiscal are not materially from those for the prior year except for the increase in to in connection with his promotion to chief operating officer and the decrease in to at his request the committee established the of executive compensation for fiscal in the fall of before the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation in the committee gave final approval to

total compensation for executive for the fiscal year just any salary and cash and the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year of compensation the of our executive compensation are equity compensation since fiscal solely of base salary discretionary cash bonus program and other primarily of health plan and deferred compensation plan and modest the committee that these are appropriate and are consistent with the long standing approach to executive compensation which made equity the dominant form of compensation the committee did not extensively this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation for each executive officer rather it upon the fact that the current structure been successfully in past and gave more particular attention to the incremental in the of the mix and the value of the total compensation represent the component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are the committee that this form of compensation above to the of employee with those of both in the short term with the performance and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five subject to vesting for long service as below to lesser extent the committee also into account that longer term vesting can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second compensation component payment of fixed cash

whose have at the same level since cash bonus discretionary cash are and have been relatively small component of compensation they address short term and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash been each year the committee that cash as modest element of compensation is consistent with long term equity as being in the greater interest of the company and its executive base and cash are in the view low to the other in our peer group below under peer other and consistent with its position as low overhead operator the company traditionally sought to have modest and other compensation significant component of this compensation is related to helping fund their retirement needs through the plan and the deferred compensation plan that the company does not have traditional retirement plan and that no executive any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing of compensation combine mix of that are intended to create for shorter term twelve and longer term performance five and beyond shorter term come primarily from the initial award of being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to significantly lesser extent discretionary cash that are subject to mix of one year performance metrics longer term come primarily from the vesting over five of and to lesser extent share ownership for executive and vesting in certain benefit such as the deferred compensation plan and retirement plan the committee that the executive compensation do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term cash bonus with and performance for of is substantially by long term equity that vest over up to five and share ownership which the committee reward sustained

of certain highly the executive the plan that certain percentage of an maybe by the company subject to certain this match will vest over period of time the company does not maintain pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any executive officer the company also the executive with certain car allowance the committee the and are modest and consistent with its overall objective of and retaining highly qualified executive compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the compensation generally the committee executive compensation and on the compensation for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee written employment contract for which was the same as his contract for the prior fiscal year the contract term was for the fiscal year unless otherwise in accordance with its it provided for base salary of it further provided for cash bonus of up to determined by the board or the committee and an award determined by the board or the committee the company had the right to terminate for cause and he had the right to terminate the agreement on days notice who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee with the agreement of messrs and them similarly for compensation owing to the in their historical and current to the success of the company except that this year at his request received smaller grant apart from the change in control provision in the equity plan applicable to all below under potential upon termination or change in control neither nor any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee performance based to the same number for the prior fiscal year that his award be reduced to and the committee to that request the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were met and all of the were subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base of messrs and have been since fiscal cash have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal messrs and each were cash of in fiscal there are no fixed criteria applied by the committee in considering the amount of these generally to the committee the bonus he is appropriate historically he modest seeking to link his bonus as percentage of that eligible amount stated in his employment contract to by generally eligible for the this year the company its internal net income goal and were eligible to receive the bonus award component associated with this goal roughly of the bonus potential to the committee bonus for other table of contents executive that were approximately of target inclusive of the net income goal he bonus for himself of approximately of his eligible amount accordingly bonus of of the eligible amount in his employment agreement the committee this request and an equal award for the committee that cash to chief executive at some peer are substantially higher the committee however to respect desire to receive modest compensation in part because it that higher would not change motivation and performance the committee in the past and to believe that messrs and are underpaid the committee also noted that messrs and have for many had direct and indirect economic in of the company which further their with the compensation of other executive as noted above the most significant component of the compensation of the executive is the award in fiscal of performance based to messrs and were and respectively the were based on the of and were the same as in fiscal except for the award for was as result of his role as chief operating officer as noted above the performance criteria were and the executive all of the subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as above for other executive were based upon the recommendation of who on the amount of increase deserved over the prior salary level salary up to over fiscal the
