we believe our disclosure these first the fact that segment disclosure is for business unit does not per se require separate discussion in that the principal business segment the segment disclosure in note on page is by the quantitative in and is not indicative of meaningful operating among our the delineation of is largely based on organization of our world wide for operational and of financial performance which geographic the are united segment canada segment and other international other international segment which is comprised of six other in which we operate other international as

of offering our low on limited selection of nationally branded and private label in wide range of merchandise which will produce high and rapid inventory turnover form page this model is consistently applied in each country in which we operate due to the relatively homogenous nature of our world wide and the consistency of our operating model we believe any additional segment discussion and analysis would not be material for in addition while some operating metrics in the six mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission are different than those of the segment as further in this response and are often different from each other these have not been material to the understanding of the for period to period in the historical operating the canada and other international and

merchandise vary closely with in net volume and therefore must be in conjunction with net our form explicitly defined gross as net less merchandise gross is key metric by our management and we believe to better understand the of our as whole gross also is metric consistently and disclosed across the retail industry in the of because of this we believe that the most effective method for and better understanding the of our is through discussion of gross as opposed to merchandise in addition we believe that we have provided in very substantial detail the for material in our gross to the extent that we know those of such include the basis point impact of gasoline on our gross percentage form page form page form page and form mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission the impact of lifo on the total and the gross percentage comparison and the impact of in foreign exchange total gross note summary of significant accounting page general we note the significance of your

consolidated on page in discussion and analysis is not the result of within the meaning of rule that lack of availability to our current to utilize these funds for expansion in our international as well as the absence of need for the funds within the due to our strong cash position domestically to clarify this distinction in future filings we will revise the discussion on page by removing the sentence cash and cash and short term by these consolidated and other may not be available to be used for certain such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock we will replace that sentence with disclosure to the following effect the company no current to repatriate the cash and cash and short term by these given our belief that our current cash position is sufficient to

eighty days after the expiration date our analysis that approximately of our their membership renewal fee late by this definition the impact of this policy change on our consolidated financial for

result in charge which could be material to the of an individual fiscal quarter and that where otherwise above reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can not be made at this time for the we note no disclosure of reasonable possible loss or range of loss in any of the therefore it is not clear whether you believe the likelihood of an adverse outcome is other than remote nor is it clear how material or potentially material the impact resulting from each of these could be on your financial we believe your disclosure should be enhanced by on the current status of the in plain rather than on the history of legal lastly it is not determinable from your disclosure if you have an accrual for one or more of these or if there are unrecognized that could require further disclosure regarding their aggregate reasonable possible loss exposure in excess of if any please advise us and revise your disclosure refer to the disclosure set forth by of mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission response the concluding paragraph of the note in question stated in part except where otherwise above reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can not be made at this time for the there is one matter to which the where otherwise qualification applied the derivative action in which it was disclosed that payment obligation of million was no accrual was made for any other matter so there was no occasion to disclose one and no range of loss was disclosed for any other contingency in the footnote because as stated we did not believe that reasonable estimate could be made note also that some of the as to which disclosure was made were not material and thus fell outside the of for example the matter was resolved in the favor we have chosen to advise of our most significant which does not mean that each is material accordingly we do not believe any revision to our prior disclosure is warranted but we will provide greater clarity in future filings regarding any taken in particular we will revise the lead in of the note to read as as necessary to reflect the current status of our as of the date of the applicable report the company is involved in number of and litigation from its business and property ownership in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the company an accrual for legal if and when those reach stage where they present loss that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such there may be possible exposure to loss in excess of any the company those for that would affect the likelihood of loss and the amount if any thereof and the amount as appropriate if the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable the company does not establish an accrual but will continue to monitor the matter for that will make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of this report the company not an accrual related to any of the or herein as the company does not believe material loss is probable in each case except where it is noted that matter been in the favor there is reasonable possibility that loss may be at this time however based on the status of each matter the possible loss or range of loss can not in our view be reasonably because among other the or sought are indeterminate or unspecified the legal and or factual are not well and or the involve complex or novel legal or large number of mew accounting branch chief united and exchange commission we believe that the disclosure of the various generally both to the history of the and the current posture this format that we believe is useful to who may be interested in concerning the disclosed particularly in putative class action litigation motion practice is critical determinant of potential financial significance thus in the matter for example the absence of class certification if sustained through the course of litigation the matter trivial from loss contingency standpoint we will however in future filings seek to reduce discussion of extraneous procedural as you we acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the
