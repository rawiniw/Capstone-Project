simultaneously achieve all three metrics in order to maintain our growth we the weighting of id and without fuel metrics to emphasize growth balanced with the focus on profit business is not sustainable if we merely increase our id but do not have corresponding increase in earnings furthermore in the id and without fuel are interrelated the goal for both the id and without fuel in higher percentage on both the target on one but not the other will limit the percentage on both by supporting the customer st strategy and the four we will better connect with our our unique competitive advantage is our ability to deliver on the four which are the that matter most to our and it is that faceted achievement that we believe our id growth as we strive to achieve our aggressive growth we also continuously aim to reduce our operating as percentage of without fuel productivity and other in operating allow us to reduce in that do not matter to our so that we can invest money in the that matter the most to our like the four we carefully manage operating cost to ensure consistent delivery of the customer experience this again the need to have multiple metrics to create and on the various behavior and that are by the design of the bonus plan of annual cash bonus plan the established by the compensation committee the actual and the bonus percentage for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as actual performance to amount target actual target weight performance metrics minimum performance id without fuel billion billion billion customer st strategy over over over total operating as budget by budget by budget by percentage of basis basis basis without fuel fuel bonus as in the footnote below or total actual performance exclude because the merger after the performance were established under the of the plan if id exceed the target and exceed the target then the percentage for reaching the target is rather than the customer st strategy component also was established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive total operating without fuel were at as percentage of for fiscal year an additional is if three with respect to its supermarket fuel achievement of the targeted fuel of million an increase in total sold of and achievement of additional fuel in service actual were fuel of million an increase in total sold of and additional fuel in service following the close of the year the compensation committee performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which those the compensation committee our management produced outstanding in measured against increasingly aggressive business plan due to our performance when to the established by the compensation committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board the and all other in the corporate annual cash bonus plan of their bonus in as in all the compensation committee discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus for all executive the if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus were not appropriate given their assessment of company performance the independent that discretion for the bonus the compensation committee and the independent also discretion to adjust the for each metric under the plan should unanticipated arise during the year no were made to the in the compensation committee and the independent in the case of the determined that the annual cash bonus appropriately reflected the strong performance in and therefore should not be the actual annual cash bonus percentage for excellent performance that our business plan with the exception of operating as percentage of without fuel the strong link between pay and performance is by comparison of under our annual cash bonus plan in previous such as and when were less than in those we did not achieve all of our business plan comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage in prior the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance annual cash bonus fiscal year percentage as above the annual cash bonus percentage is applied to each bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent in the case of the the actual of performance based annual cash to the for are in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee in the importance of providing an incentive to the to achieve the long term established by the board as such majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the long term and is via four long term compensation long term cash bonus performance stock and restricted stock long term compensation long term value creation and the over emphasis of short term at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee several in the target value of long term compensation to the or in the case of the to the independent the amount these include the compensation report regarding long term compensation by our peer group the level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation within individual performance and the recommendation of the for all other than the long term are structured to be combination of performance and time based compensation that of financial and stock performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial and to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the long term strategic stock and restricted stock are linked to stock performance alignment between and company have no initial value and only realize if the value of our stock following the date of grant majority of long term compensation is equity based performance stock and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common further the of our with our all four of long term compensation are intended to focus executive on our long term strategy each component is in more detail below of long term compensation and outstanding for the are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis long term incentive plan design in contrast to the performance based annual cash bonus plan above which approximately our performance based long term incentive plan approximately the each year we adopt similar long term incentive plan which for three year performance the long term incentive plan of performance based long term cash bonus and performance which the following the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition fixed number of performance is to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the are out in common based on actual performance along with cash amount equal to the during the performance period on the number of common ultimately the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance are each determined based on our performance against the same metrics established by the compensation committee the independent for the at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance actual can not exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance the compensation committee long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year each year when the performance metric and percentage per unit of improvement the compensation committee the difficulty of improvement over time during performance to approximately the long term incentive plan metrics and connection to our business strategy metric rationale for use customer st strategy customer st strategy is the focus in all of decision making on the customer the four of customer st strategy are people shopping experience and price this proprietary metric the improvement in how is by in each of the four long term incentive plan is based on all of the of the customer st strategy to maintain our consistent focus on the entirety of the customer st strategy this is in contrast to the annual cash bonus which is based on certain of the customer st plan to highlight annual that are intended to receive the most attention in that year improvement in associate engagement in an annual survey of this metric is included in the long term incentive plan as an that our success is directly tied to our with and serving our every day whether in our distribution or reduction in as percentage without fuel an essential part of model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take out of the business in sustainable way we strive to be so that as the company are properly this metric is included in both the annual cash bonus plan and long term incentive operating without fuel can be temporarily on an annual basis but it is more difficult to maintain these over time it is the role of the approximately in the long term incentive plan to continue to reduce operating as percentage of without fuel over time and to ensure such are sustainable over the long term this metric in the long term incentive plan these key to implement for sustainable improvement over long period of time part of our long term growth strategy is to increase capital over time we have pipeline of high quality and store and we continue to increase the square footage in our fill in with capital spend it is essential that we achieve the proper on our

that protect and enhance the value of our there is increasing recognition that company related to human such as litigation damage and project and can adversely affect shareholder value like many other adopted supplier code of conduct see the company standard vendor agreement but yet to publish company wide human policy human and separate human code that to its adoption of these would be an

shareholder proposal we have been notified by one shareholder the name and of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at our executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting shareholder repurchase dividend resolved of the ask the board of to adopt and issue general policy that preference to share relative to cash as method to return capital to if general policy currently we ask that it be appropriately supporting statement share as method to return capital to have distinct relative to share should be preferred for the following financial flexibility four from duke university and university studied to pay or make by surveying of of public they found that the dividend level is on par with investment while are made out of the residual cash flow after investment spending further in follow up as part of the study state that they would pass up some positive net present value investment before cutting the creation of long term value is of paramount importance believe that have the distinct advantage that they do not create an incentive to forgo long term value in order to preserve historic dividend level tax efficiency share have been in the wall street journal as akin to but without the tax bite for the distribution of dividend may automatically trigger tax liability for some the repurchase of does not necessarily trigger that automatic tax liability and therefore shareholder the flexibility to choose when the tax liability is who desire cash flow can choose to sell and pay as appropriate this proposal does not constitute tax advice market acceptance some may believe that the growth rate or reducing the level of would result in negative stock market reaction however study in the journal of finance that the market response to cutting by that were also share was not statistically distinguishable from zero believe this study evidence that there is market acceptance that are valid for some may worry that share could be used to prop up metrics that factor into the compensation of believe that any such concern should not interfere with the choice of optimal mechanism because compensation can be designed such that metrics are to account for share in summary strongly believe that general policy that preference to share would enhance long term value creation urge to vote for this proposal science article stock help buoy the market share and the substitution hypothesis the board of vote against this proposal for the following that the policy by the shareholder proposal is not in the best of our as it long term flexibility in the allocation of capital in rapidly capital market this flexibility is an essential element in the careful management of shareholder capital which the board thoughtfully and on regular basis our long term financial strategy to be to use cash flow from in balanced manner to repurchase fund and increase capital all while our current

million in we record to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest collectively that have goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the

the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the non lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we inventory write in connection with store if any in merchandise we expense to transfer inventory and equipment from closed as they are post retirement benefit we account for our defined benefit pension the recognition and disclosure of which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement on the consolidated balance sheet we record as component of other comprehensive income actuarial gains or prior service or and transition that have not yet been the determination of our obligation and expense for company pension and other post retirement is dependent upon our selection of used by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount was to match the cash to that of hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from and match the benefit cash the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively the hypothetical bond portfolio with an aa or better rating with the assistance of an outside consultant we discount rate of and as of year end for pension and other respectively basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately million to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets by for we considered current and plan asset as well as historical and of return on various asset in our assumed pension plan investment return rate was to in and in our pension average rate of return was for the calendar ended net of all investment management and the value of all in our company defined benefit pension during the calendar year ending net of investment management and for the past our average annual rate of return been based on the above information and forward looking for made in manner consistent with our target we believe rate of return assumption is reasonable for see note to the consolidated financial for more information on the asset of pension plan assets on we adopted mortality tables industry based tables for reflecting more current mortality experience and for future generational mortality improvement in calculating our benefit as of and and our pension expense the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and our benefit obligation and future we used the to

obligation expense point decrease decrease change increase increase discount rate return on assets in we million to our company defined benefit and do not expect to make any to these in in we did not

performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of we and million in million in and million in to employee retirement the increase in to is due to higher employee rate the increase in to is due to the effect of our merger with teeter the retirement account provide to eligible both matching and automatic from the company based on participant plan compensation and length of service employer pension we contribute to various employer pension the consolidated pension plan based on from collective we are as the fiduciary of the consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets these employer pension provide retirement to based on their service to the are from assets in trust for that purpose are in equal number by and the typically are responsible for the level of to be provided to as well as for such as the investment of the assets and the administration of the in we million to the consolidated pension plan we had previously million of the total at and expense for the million at the time of payment in in we charge of million after tax related to and withdrawal associated with the of pension plan of which million was to the consolidated pension plan in as of we are not to contribute to the consolidated pension plan in we recognize expense in connection with these as are funded or when are made in accordance with we made cash to these of million in million in and million in based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially in most of the employer to which we contribute substantially the value of the assets in trust to pay we have to estimate the amount by which these exceed the assets the amount of as of because we are only one of number of to these we also have to estimate the ratio of our to the total of all to these in year as way of our share of the nonetheless the is not direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of we estimate that our share of the of employer to which we contribute was approximately billion tax or billion after tax which share of of its employer this an increase in the amount of of approximately billion tax or approximately million after tax as of to the increase in the amount of is attributable to lower than on the assets in the employer during in mortality rate and the merger of our estimate is based on the most current information available to us actuarial and other data that include the of and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this is direct liability of ours rather we believe the is likely to have important in we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension subject to collective and capital market we expect in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few finally that in the event we were to exit certain or otherwise cease making to these funds we could trigger substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be when it is probable that liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the of the assets in the trust significantly increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset decline if currently to these funds cease participation or if occur through collective trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of ours any to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made see note to the consolidated financial for more information to our participation in these employer pension uncertain tax we review the tax taken or to be taken on

and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit fall the ability to borrow under our current program could be adversely affected for period of time and increase our interest cost on daily under our program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of

our credit rating the interest cost on under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march we had billion of outstanding the increase as of march to year end

to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially the guidance below our for we expect net earnings to be to per diluted share which is essentially in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by actual fuel which we expect to be at or slightly below the five year average with continued volatility we expect our core business in to grow in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in reflecting the lower inflationary environment we expect full year fifo operating in excluding fuel to expand slightly to we expect capital excluding and of to be to billion these capital include approximately major covering and ruler to major and other minor and technology and infrastructure to support our customer st business strategy we expect total supermarket square footage for to grow approximately before and operational we expect year end to increase slightly to the result we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the resolution of certain tax in we anticipate product cost inflation of to excluding fuel and an lifo charge of approximately million we expect inflation to be lower during the portion of and to gradually rise during the later portion of we expect company pension expense to be approximately million we do not expect to make cash contribution in in we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of any that would commit us to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate with for store in little rock southern and in this year will be as we must have competitive cost in each market while meeting our needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement various and other could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward looking these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial our ability to achieve earnings and cash flow may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending volatility of fuel in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock our ability to retain pharmacy from third party consolidation in the industry pharmacy benefit our ability to negotiate to employer pension natural or adverse weather the potential and associated with potential or data security the success of our future growth and the successful integration of teeter and our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by year end in product our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by in product at year end if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since fuel lower profit than our supermarket we expect to see our fifo gross decline as fuel increase we can not fully foresee the effects of in economic on business we have assumed economic and competitive will not change significantly in other and not above could also cause actual to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information
