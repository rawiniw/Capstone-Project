its carbon or in improving shareholder value through renewable energy adoption this shareholder resolution take first step toward renewable energy adoption by the climate change risk reduction of renewable energy urge yes vote on the proposal resolved clause request produce report the climate change risk reduction of quantitative enterprise wide for increasing its renewable energy the report should be produced at reasonable cost and exclude proprietary information supporting statement request the report also include discussion of the business risk from climate change the potential for renewable energy procurement to reduce such risk and for increasing renewable energy adoption report improving today to protect tomorrow corporation data international energy statistics may tid aid

reduce those and benefit the company despite to carbon footprint remains enormous and the company to address its climate impact have been meager in comparison to other renewable energy adoption the company an important by which it can reduce risk and protect shareholder value into the future significantly on reducing climate and renewable energy adoption carbon have continued to rise since its carbon reduction have been anemic and renewable energy adoption is negligible to its the lack of substantial action on this issue the serious its environmental to the reputation relevance and ongoing competitiveness to disclose information to assess how or whether the company is adequately carbon risk or renewable energy portfolio into the future the recent and carbon disclosure project remain and unclear providing data with moving and that while to be significant actually encompass only slight the only discussion of future renewable energy adoption is statement that three will be solar discussion climate change to that remain insufficiently increasing renewable energy adoption will reduce those and benefit the company in contrast to most today neither annual report nor its proxy

reduction with prior year that the company had nearly accomplished the future accomplishment although the in previous are in the right direction this recent practice of moving goal back every year and likely impetus to determine meaningful way forward in significant carbon reduction and renewable energy development the by this proposal study considering the feasibility of renewable energy target is an important first step in assuring that our company is working to effectively remedy its climate risk climate change information request corporation section and section our goal is to build on our
