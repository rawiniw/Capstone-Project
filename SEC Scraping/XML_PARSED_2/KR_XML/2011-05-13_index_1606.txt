and currently of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger have these include current period combined

carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest collectively our with goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and excluding goodwill to estimate an fair value of the goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value the annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of in an impairment charge of million based on the of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of supermarket unit with small number of potential impairment due to future cash being lower than in the past our fair value of the unit we that the carrying value of goodwill for this unit its fair value due to the fair value of the unit resulting in tax impairment charge of million million after tax in we disclosed that reduction in fair value of this supermarket unit would indicate potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this unit in the third quarter of our operating performance due to deflation and intense competition during the third quarter of based on for and the initial of our annual budget process of the supermarket management that there were evident to warrant impairment testing of these in the third quarter of we did not test the variable interest with goodwill for impairment as no event based on the of our step one analysis in the third quarter of the unit in southern was the only unit for which there was potential impairment in the operating performance of the unit was significantly affected by the economic at the time and to competitive in southern as result of this decline in current and future cash along with comparable fair value information management that the carrying value of goodwill for the unit its fair value resulting in tax impairment charge of after tax subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the unit management used an equal weighting of cash and weighted multiple to estimate fair value the cash assume long term growth comparable to historical performance and discount rate of in addition the in the declined since those used in the assessment based on current and future cash the company additional goodwill are not reasonably possible reduction in fair value of the would not indicate potential for impairment of the goodwill balance except for one non supermarket unit with goodwill of the fair value of this unit was cash the cash assume long term growth comparable to historical and discount rate of for additional information to our of the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the noncancellable lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future or that no longer is for its originally intended purpose is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we inventory write in connection with store if any in merchandise we expense to transfer inventory and equipment from closed as they are post retirement benefit company defined benefit pension we account for our defined benefit pension the recognition and disclosure of which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement on the consolidated balance sheet we record as component of other comprehensive income actuarial gains or prior service or and transition that have not yet been the determination of our obligation and expense for company pension and other post retirement is dependent upon our selection of used by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount as of year end was to match the cash to that of yield curve that the equivalent on zero coupon corporate for each maturity benefit cash due in particular year can theoretically be settled by them in the zero coupon bond that in the same year the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively represent the equivalent single under broad market aa yield curve we discount rate of and for year end for pension and other respectively basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately million to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and plan asset as well as historical and of return on various asset for and we assumed pension plan investment return rate of our pension average rate of return was for the calendar ended net of all investment management and the value of all in our company defined benefit pension during the calendar year ending net of investment management and primarily due to the strength of the market in for the past our average annual rate of return been the average annual return for the over the same period of time been based on the above information and forward looking for made in manner consistent with our target we believe an rate of return assumption is reasonable see note to the consolidated financial for more information on the asset of pension plan

decrease in the amount of of approximately million tax or million after tax as of to the decrease in the amount of is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit our

adjustment for withdrawal liability will be when it is probable that liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and future expense would be favorably affected if the of the assets in the trust significantly increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand share of the could increase and future expense could be adversely affected if the asset decline if currently to these funds cease

liquidity noted above we also expect to be able to fund future principal of long term debt from our cash from operating and if necessary by issuing additional debt we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to maintain our current debt and to respond effectively to competitive affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper program at we did not have any outstanding are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit fall the ability to borrow under our current program could be adversely affected for period of time and increase our interest cost on daily under our program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our program would be any lower than million on daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our credit default swap spread or an increase in our leverage ratio our credit facility also the maintenance of leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio our financial failure to maintain our financial

payment up to our self insured retention these do not represent of as we already have on our for the market may make the surety more costly and in some availability of these may become more limited which could affect our of or access to such although we do not believe or availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety if this does become an issue we would issue of

real estate in which we have ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the be unable to meet their approximately million based on the underlying this indebtedness as of we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these we also are contingently liable for that have been assigned to various third in connection with facility and we could be to satisfy under the if any of the are unable to fulfill their lease due to the wide distribution of our among third and various other available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be to assume material amount of these is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics for certain pension trust fund contribution and withdrawal in addition to the above we enter

become effective for interim and annual beginning after the require us to disclose in and out of level and level fair value and describe the for the as well as activity in level fair value the also require more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and being measured as well as regarding and valuation of the fair value we adopted the effective except for about certain level activity

that entitle their to receive nonforfeitable before vesting should be considered and included in the computation of pursuant to the two class method see note to the consolidated financial for further discussion of its adoption outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash flow capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for we expect the second and third quarter earnings per diluted share growth rate to be below the annual growth rate due to tax in the growth in the second quarter is to be the of the year we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in for we will continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer st strategy by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect non fuel operating for to be comparable to excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge for we expect fuel which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel sold for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million to million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our we do not expect to make cash contribution to the company defined benefit pension during if contribution is made to the company defined benefit pension we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few we do not anticipate additional goodwill in we have various labor that will be in covering store in southern and west we will also negotiate with the who represent some of our in distribution and operation in the upon the expiration of our collective work by the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work stoppage affecting substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in we expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over each rolling three to five year time period our dividend our business model is to generate total shareholder return on average of to over each rolling three to five year time period various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock and the success of our future growth our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline more than if we are unable to pass on any cost fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we could fail to realize our operating per gallon of fuel and fuel sold based upon in the price of fuel change in our operating or if pattern of rapid in fuel we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate plan compensation and length of service of our and expense related to employer pension funds could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if volatility in the financial or our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may decrease customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the cost our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by adverse weather particularly to the extent that and other disrupt our or those of our create in the availability or in the cost of that we sell in our or and we use in our or raise the cost of energy to our various
