conjunction with the consolidated financial overview first quarter total were billion with billion for the same period of this increase was attributable to identical supermarket and fuel gallon partially offset by decrease in the average retail fuel price identical supermarket excluding fuel in the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily due to an increase in the number of shopping with us an increase in per household and product cost inflation every supermarket store department and every operating division had positive identical this our trend of positive identical supermarket growth for consecutive quarters our customer to deliver solid for the first quarter of net earnings million or per diluted share to million or per diluted share for the same period of net

million or per diluted share for the first quarter of the pension plan in an increase in operating general and administrative expense of million million after tax in the first quarter of we believe net earnings and net earnings per diluted share present more accurate year over year comparison of our financial because the pension plan were not the result of our normal the increase in net earnings for the first quarter of to the net earnings for the first quarter of primarily from an increase in non fuel first in first out fifo operating profit partially offset by tax expense and slight decrease in earnings from our fuel based on the strength of our for the first quarter of we have both the lower and upper of our guidance for identical supermarket for fiscal year please refer to the outlook section for more information on our of net earnings net earnings million for the first quarter of an increase of from net earnings of million for the first quarter of net earnings for the first quarter of from net earnings of million for the first quarter of excluding the pension plan the increase in net earnings for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from an increase in non fuel fifo operating profit partially offset by tax expense and slight decrease in earnings from our fuel the increase in non fuel fifo operating profit for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from the benefit of supermarket the charge due to the pension plan productivity and effective cost partially offset by continued in lower for our and in company pension credit card incentive plan benefit and shrink included in continued in lower for our is the cost of our pharmacy which experienced high of inflation that were not fully on to the customer in the first quarter of the slight decrease in our net earnings from our fuel for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from decrease in the average per gallon of fuel sold partially offset by an

first quarter of from net earnings per diluted share of for the first quarter of excluding the pension plan net earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of to the first quarter of due to net earnings and the repurchase of common resulting in lower weighted average outstanding management net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to and because they more accurately reflect our day to day business than do the generally accepted accounting principle of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are non generally accepted accounting principle non financial and should not be considered to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other measure of performance net earnings and net earnings per

to measure our progress against internal and the following table reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the to net earnings attributable to the excluding the pension plan and reconciliation of
