confidential treatment by the to consolidated financial page note accounting page page we note that you operate retail food and drug department jewelry and convenience throughout the united and that these retail are as single reportable segment please tell us the operating you have in accordance with through the used to identify reportable and the basis for operating into single reportable segment given the aggregation criteria in and quantitative in please be sure to explain to us in detail how the aggregation of all of the retail into one reportable segment with the aggregation criteria response our retail business which over of consolidated and retail food and drug convenience and jewelry under the set forth in through we have operating which we refer to as operating within our business our include geographically dispersed operating under variety of king and in addition our and our jewelry each constitute an individual operating division each of our operating is engaged in business from which it and each discrete financial information available the operating of these operating are regularly by our chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as our chief operating decision these are based on the aggregation of in each geographic area not based on the aggregation of by format type our operating operate across and are organized on geographical basis so that each operating division executive team can be responsive to local needs of the division and can execute company strategic and throughout the in its division we strive to manage our to consistent performance over time not running each operating division as silo but together as cohesive network strategic guidance marketing procurement and support for other administrative are centrally that two or more operating may be into single operating segment if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic of the rule the have similar economic and the are similar in all of the following the nature of the and the nature of the production the type or class of customer for their and the used to distribute their or provide their and if applicable the nature of the regulatory environment for example banking insurance or public confidential treatment by the as we discuss below our operating are similar in all of these and have similar economic as well each of our operating similar to and the nature of the production process is similar while we typically use variety of store in each of the supermarket operating such as combination department and fresh each supermarket operating division similar mix of all of our offer broad selection of grocery and of produce meat and general merchandise health and beauty there are some in product at different store primarily due to store and of the store location but these are not significant in relation to the entire product mix for example smaller due to often may not have or may have smaller offering of general merchandise in addition of the store can also affect the breadth or depth of product in store the mix of will also vary based on the customer and of each store for example more ethnic will be carried in that serve diverse customer base and more value banner may be carried in with higher than average number of who have shopping as price sensitive however we believe these are insubstantial to the between product at each supermarket operating division although the nature of the production process in subparagraph of does not apply to how we develop the product mix at our the strategic guidance marketing procurement and administrative supporting product mix is centrally and thus these are substantially the same across our operating each of the operating similar and in the same regulatory environment each operating division broad cross section of the population economically and demographically similar of purchase our across all of our particular type or class of customer does not shop in our in search of one specific type of product or service our typically shop across variety of and from multiple within our each time they shop in addition all of our retail operate in the united and are subject to substantially similar regulatory there is no significant or unusual regulatory environment in one division as to another that the sale of our each of our operating and its in similar fashion most of the sold by our operating are from third party consumer product and distributed either to our distribution or directly to our each operating division like broadly to all of our in similar manner in fact these operating at receive consumer merchandise from the same distribution confidential treatment by the similar economic the economic between our operating are by our approach to our retail business as whole we manage and review all of our operating together as single portfolio the key metrics that the review regularly include id without fuel and without fuel although fuel is an important product offering of our supermarket and store the key metrics that are by our typically exclude fuel and frequent in the retail price of fuel create significant in fuel as such it is more meaningful for our to review identical without the effect of fuel similarly our retail fuel reduce our as percent of due to the very low on retail fuel as to non fuel we currently disclose the and effects of fuel in discussion and analysis in our periodic filings with these in mind the evaluate the following metrics when performance of and to our operating in and our strategy we strive for parity in across our however the economic competitive and labor across all of our do not always result in exact parity an important part of how we manage our business is to understand the in these and many other that affect our business and influence our so that we can balance our to be consistent over time we not only seek parity in but also in execution of our customer many of our strategic are broad appeal in nature as such we typically introduce price or other customer across all of our supermarket operating however the effects on id without fuel and are not always the same in each of those operating so though we launch the same program confidential treatment by the across all of our and achieve consistency in execution across all of our this does not always result in identical financial metrics this portfolio management view of our operating by our is an important way that they leverage the assets of our company geographical customer and location diversity to achieve overall we use the same core product across all of our along with consistent execution of strategic to drive total company economic competitive labor and other are built into individual division when are to vary from overall typically through the process nearly half of our jewelry store are inside one of the included in supermarket operating division where our loyalty marketing group the and of at particular store location as good fit and that location is considered for an in store jewelry store in addition just like any other in store department customer at all jewelry store earn that can be for on fuel at one of the or that sell fuel we have included the jewelry in the same operating segment as our other retail because there are many operational between jewelry and other of our retail business due to their relative we do not believe inclusion of these the of the overall reportable segment and due to their relative we do not believe that showing the jewelry in an other reportable segment is meaningful to all of our operating have similar economic as such we believe that aggregation of our operating into single operating segment is appropriate under the previously none of our operating meet the quantitative for separate under and thus we have we have one reportable segment we do believe however that may benefit from more detailed explanation of the used to identify our operating the basis of organization in future form filings we will add comparable disclosure to our segment footnote as the domestic retail which represent over of the consolidated and are its only reportable segment the retail operating have been into one reportable segment due to the operating similar economic with similar long term financial performance in addition the operating offer to its similar have similar distribution operate in similar regulatory purchase the majority of their merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many identical on basis from location serve similar of and are capital from location the operating reflect the manner in which the business is and how the chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as our chief operating decision assess performance internally please also see our response to comment below for additional disclosure to be made with respect to product information we note that you sell wide variety of
