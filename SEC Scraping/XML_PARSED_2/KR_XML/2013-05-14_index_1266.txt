portion of pay should be performance based increasing proportionally with an level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance both short and long term focus compensation should include an opportunity for and requirement of equity ownership and of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that with our business strategy the compensation of our senior in fiscal year once again reflected these total compensation for the year how well to our business plan reflecting how our compensation program to business and the we have continued to deliver growth and positive earnings key metric identical supermarket excluding fuel and the week to

shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting independent board chair resolved the of the company urge the board of to adopt policy that the chairman be an independent director the policy should be so as not to violate any contractual obligation and should specify how to select independent chairman if current chairman to be independent during the time between annual of and that compliance with the policy is if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chairman supporting statement it is the responsibility of the board of to protect long term by providing independent oversight of management by setting and the position of chairman is critical in shaping the work of the board in our opinion board of is less likely to provide rigorous independent oversight of management the chairman is the as is the case with our company as both chairman and since we believe that board chairman who is independent of the company and its management is governance practice that will promote greater management accountability to and lead to more objective evaluation of management according to the for corporate governance and performance yale school of management the independent chair of interest oversight of risk the relationship between the board and as conduit for regular communication with and is logical next step in the development of an independent board the board the case for independent leadership in corporate north an blue ribbon commission on professionalism several ago that an independent director should be with the evaluation of the and provide ongoing feedback executive sessions of the board setting the agenda and leading the board in and to crises blue ribbon report from the conference board that sentiment few later number of institutional believe that strong objective board leader can best provide the necessary oversight of management thus the public retirement global of accountable corporate governance that board should generally be by an independent director as does the council of institutional we thus believe that an independent director serving as chairman can help ensure the of an effective board we urge you to vote for this resolution the board of vote against this proposal for the following board is structured to provide the best governance on behalf of that structure also all of the raised in the supporting statement board is comprised of an overwhelming majority of independent each of these is annually by the and although not in the proposal board is led by strong independent lead director who the same and against mismanagement that the proposal in particular lead director in variety of and all board meeting meeting and to ensure that the appropriate are and that sufficient time is to each serving as liaison between the chairman of the board management and the non management at the executive sessions of independent after each board meeting and at all other of the board at which the chairman is not present calling an executive session of the independent at any time and serving as the representative for any consultation and direct communication following request with major these are set forth in the on of corporate governance on our at the board routinely leadership structure this review discussion of performance the impact that the leadership on that performance and the structure that best the of contrary to the in the supporting statement there is no established consensus that separating the of the chairman and the is best practice or that such separation for the of school of business article splitting up the of and chairman reform or red herring knowledge article that there is no evidence that separating the of chairman and corporate performance in corporate governance update of board composition and laura york law journal the that from board effectiveness perspective there is no need to separate the of chairman and so long as there is an effective lead director in place in addition the majority of have not the structure by the proposal while there may be in which of would be best by an independent board chair those simply do not currently exist at there have been in past in which the of chairman of the board and have been but current do not warrant separation the board will continue to review leadership structure to ensure that the structure best and dynamic business for the foregoing the board vote against this proposal shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by shareholder the name and of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas product is significant consumer of natural and energy and major source of waste and greenhouse gas more than half of product is in or burned rather than only of plastic is paper and comprise of waste nestle north plastic are the contributor to it carbon footprint coca cola is the part of the carbon footprint of several recent analysis of environmental protection agency data that the energy to produce and dispose of and for of total paper in methane whose greenhouse warming potential is more potent than metal paper and plastic have large energy and because of the high of raw for have solid waste disposal and in the extended producer responsibility is corporate and public policy that accountability for collection and from and to coca cola and nestle have endorsed such make it take it for the of if other also pay their fair share when all pay based on the amount of used no company should have to pay disproportionate cost set to increase recovery of its used by in many other consumer that put on the market are already financially responsible for its more than have of organization for economic and development have some form of producer in place in and recover far higher of than the control design and marketing and are so best positioned to choose the most and reduce overall environmental impact of product can create economic for used of can yield strong environmental lead to more efficient use of reduced extraction of natural and toxic and less post consumer flowing into where it marine life be it resolved that of the request that the board of issue report at reasonable cost confidential information the feasibility of policy of extended producer responsibility for house brand post consumer product as of increasing of and reducing carbon and air and water pollution resulting from the business supporting statement believe policy in the report should include taking responsibility for house brand post consumer package as appropriate and in development of producer and the board of vote against this proposal for the following the regarding waste reduction and the important role it as good steward of the environment we have numerous in place to preserve our natural and to conserve energy for instance the company more than million of plastic waste from and plastic film in the company also more than billion of cardboard each year most importantly weve the perishable partnership which the donation of more than million of safe wholesome food to feeding food to fight hunger in local by innovative of these food is reducing the amount of waste being sent to for each of the past several we have on line the public report and our annual report that highlight the and waste reduction in greater detail this proposal that take additional to report on the feasibility of policy of extended producer responsibility or the resolution no guidance regarding view of the of company adopted policy to reduce waste in the supply chain as above and in our various it would be inappropriate however to support policy that is not clearly defined we believe our support for waste reduction in our supply chain are significant and meaningful is familiar with various in and in other that require and to pay substantial and related to waste disposal the vary in detail and implementation and while we do assess and for their feasibility cost and to do so for each individual proposal at the federal state and international level would require significant that could be more wisely in the best of often is to take position on legislation or regulatory while occasionally we will communicate to federal state and local our on specific policy we believe it is premature to offer an official position statement on legislative and regulatory without first carefully examining the of each individual law or regulation and how it would affect our and our business this proposal is virtually identical to one to vote at last annual meeting and was soundly by shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by shareholder the name and of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas the social and environmental impact of palm oil production create important for trying to ensure more sustainable and lower risk supply chain because our company not yet to procure certified sustainable palm oil for its we believe it itself to to its reputation as well as to the long term security of its palm oil supply the of palm

and or forced labor to palm oil production in and many of these are not part of such labor may violate international of human according to the union of concerned palm oil are disproportionately large source of global warming because they are often established on land converted from swamp when these are drained their carbon rich peaty decay large of both carbon dioxide and methane thus the expansion of onto peat is an important source of the that cause global warming june due in part to deforestation been the emitter of greenhouse globally world bank the conversion of for roughly half of buy only of its gross domestic product palm oil that are not have of species such as the orangutan failure to manage risk connected to palm oil in supply been disruptive for number of major nestle and who made palm oil in that in negative publicity en mas group to address the social and environmental associated with palm oil production and to promote sustainable palm oil the on sustainable palm oil was formed in leading have to source only certified sustainable palm oil by or sooner mart general nestle and our company not made such commitment and not adequately the above resolved request the board of adopt and implement comprehensive sustainable palm oil policy supporting statement we believe such policy should include target date for certified sustainable palm oil or for covering of palm oil for independent verification of compliance with the policy support for moratorium on palm oil expansion in and and commitment to disclose publicly the progress on this issue the board of vote against this proposal for the following many of the regarding the social and environmental of palm oil production this is issue for many of our and we are to working with them to explore to improve in the palm oil production supply chain recently palm oil policy via our corporate and news release the policy an endorsement of the for sustainable palm oil in accordance with policy we will purchase

return on capital we calculate return on capital by dividing operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average capital operating profit is calculated by excluding certain included in operating profit and our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average capital is calculated as the sum of the average of our total assets the average lifo reserve the average depreciation and amortization and rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters by factor of eight minus the average receivable the average trade payable the average and wages and the average other current are calculated for return on capital by the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is common factor used by our and is non financial measure of performance should not be in isolation or considered as substitute for our

financial in conformity with us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could differ from those we believe that the following accounting are the most critical in the preparation of our financial because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex about the effect of that are inherently uncertain self insurance we primarily are self insured for related to compensation and general liability the represent our best estimate generally accepted actuarial of the ultimate for plus those but not for all through we establish case for case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both compensation and general liability we have stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on per claim basis we are insured for covered in excess of these per claim we account for the for compensation on present value basis risk discount rate basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability are not the underlying the ultimate of claim are subject to high degree of which can affect the liability for such for example variability in inflation of health care inherent in these can affect the similarly in legal and as well as change in the nature and method of how are settled can affect ultimate our of do not anticipate significant in historical for these and any could have considerable effect on future claim and currently of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger have these include current period combined with history of or projection of or significant decrease in the market value of an asset when trigger event we perform an impairment calculation undiscounted cash current cash flow information and growth related to specific to the carrying value for those if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market or future cash we record impairment when the carrying value fair market value with respect to property and equipment for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable based on our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value reduced by direct of disposal we asset in the normal course of business million in million in and million in we record to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest collectively our with goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and excluding goodwill to estimate an fair value of the goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value the annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment the annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of in an impairment charge of million based on the of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of supermarket unit with small number of potential impairment due to future cash being lower than in the past our fair value of the unit we that the carrying value of goodwill for this unit its fair value resulting in tax impairment charge of million million after tax in we disclosed that reduction in fair value of this supermarket unit would indicate potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this unit based on current and future cash we believe goodwill are not reasonably possible reduction in fair value of our would not indicate potential for impairment of our goodwill balance for additional information to our of the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the non lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future or that no longer is for its originally intended purpose is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we inventory write in connection with store if any in merchandise we expense to transfer inventory and equipment from closed as they are post retirement benefit we account for our defined benefit pension the recognition and disclosure of which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement on the consolidated balance sheet we record as component of other comprehensive income actuarial gains or prior service or and transition that have not yet been the determination of our obligation and expense for company pension and other post retirement is dependent upon our selection of used by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our policy for the discount as of year end from the policy as of year end and in our policy was to match the cash to that of hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from and match the benefit cash the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively the hypothetical bond portfolio with an aa or better rating with the assistance of an outside consultant in and our policy was to match the cash to that of yield curve that the equivalent on zero coupon corporate for each maturity benefit cash due in particular year can theoretically be settled by them in the zero coupon bond that in the same year the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively the equivalent single under broad market aa yield curve with the assistance of an outside consultant basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and plan asset as well as historical and of return

substantially the value of the assets in trust to pay we have to estimate the amount by which these exceed the assets the amount of as of because is only one of number of to these we also have to estimate the ratio of to the total of all to these in year as way of share of the nonetheless the is not direct obligation or liability of or of any employer except as noted above as of we estimate that share of the of employer to which was billion tax or billion after tax this decrease in the amount of of approximately million tax or million after tax as of to the decrease in the amount of is attributable to our contribution to the consolidated pension plan in and the on the assets in the employer during our estimate is based on the most current information available to us actuarial and other data that include the of and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this is direct liability of rather we believe the is likely to have important in excluding all to the consolidated pension plan and the pension that were consolidated into the consolidated pension plan our to these approximately over the prior year and have grown at compound annual rate of approximately since in we expect to contribute approximately million to our employer pension subject to collective and capital market this amount contribution decrease to due to the consolidated pension plan excluding all to the consolidated pension plan and the pension that were consolidated into the consolidated pension plan based on current market we expect in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few finally that in the event we were to exit certain or otherwise cease making to these funds we could trigger substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be when it is probable that liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and future expense would be favorably affected if the of the assets in the trust significantly increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand share of the could increase and future expense could be adversely affected if the asset decline if currently to these funds cease participation or if occur through collective trustee action or adverse legislation see note to the consolidated financial for more information to our

state bonding this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility we have half of the indebtedness of two real estate in which we have ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the be unable to meet their approximately million based on the underlying this indebtedness as of we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these we also are contingently liable for that have been assigned to various third in connection with facility and we could be to satisfy under the if any of the are unable to fulfill their lease due to the wide distribution of our among third and various other available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be to assume material amount of these is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics for certain pension trust fund contribution and withdrawal in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification and take on

serving as on benefit while aggregate indemnification obligation could result in material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in material liability outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for this to our long term growth rate of to from our fiscal net earnings per diluted share of which the consolidated pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter of and the extra week in the fourth quarter of we expect the first quarter net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be on the low end of the range primarily due to inflation being lower in the first quarter of to and the growth of our pharmacy business not being as substantial as in the first quarter of we expect the second and third quarters net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be at the high end to above the range primarily due to inflation being more comparable in the second and third quarters of to the second and third quarters of and our identical supermarket to be upwards we also expect the fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be lower than the prior year on week to week basis primarily due to lifo charge of million to lifo credit of million in the fourth quarter of we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in we expect identical supermarket growth to increase over time during relative to in we experienced higher of inflation early in the year in the second half of the year several branded prescription came off patent and when branded prescription come off patent and are sold as are reduced because generic have lower retail than branded we do not expect these to continue to have the same impact for our long term business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth plus dividend of to for total shareholder return of approximately for we intend to continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer st strategy by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect fifo non fuel operating for to expand slightly to excluding the consolidated pension plan accrual and the credit card settlement in for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we may re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion filling in targeted entering market and on productivity from our store base through in addition we intend to continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate and logistics and technology our continued capital spending on technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and is to reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to increase to the range of billion excluding and of we also expect capital to increase million over the next few excluding and of to accomplish our strategy we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage under our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our in we million to the company defined benefit pension and do not expect to make any additional in we expect made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to

previously with commercial paper we have various labor that will be in covering store in and among upon the expiration of our collective work by the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work stoppage affecting substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of

aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock the effect of brand prescription going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy from third party and the success of our future growth the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost will depend on the of our and to those our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings during the first three quarters of the year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by year end in product our lifo charge for the year will be affected primarily by in product at year end if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings in the and of that compete with us are likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of the of our and expense related to employer pension funds could vary from the that we expect and could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if the investment performance of our pension plan assets does not meet due to poor performance of the financial or for other our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be

the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may decrease customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the cost our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by natural or adverse weather particularly to the extent that they disrupt our
