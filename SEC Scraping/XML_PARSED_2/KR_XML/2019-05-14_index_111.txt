we are looking first for driving and cost across both brick and mortar and digital by in logistics and technology and finally capital for activity our compensation committee is on pay for performance the compensation committee long strong pay for performance philosophy compensation must the of our with the of our and must create to achieve the annual business plan and longer term company we long term performance based bonus program available to at the level of vice president and above more than ten ago and the metrics were to our long term at that time as our business have the compensation committee is on performance metrics are with our long term strategy our long term compensation program with restock we made to on three year time horizon under restock we believe that the success of restock on the attention of our leadership team and on the of restock and that it is essential to implement performance metrics that mirror these accordingly in we made to our program to with restock our three year long term plan performance metrics tied entirely to restock restock cash flow and cost included in fifo operating profit growth with return on capital modifier we metric based on the cost in the achievement of operating profit growth because cost is essential to fund the strategic that will produce the operating profit growth we believe it is more meaningful metric than operating profit growth itself because it us to focus on the that we need to support sustainable incremental operating profit growth since we grant three year long term incentive plan each year at any one time there are three outstanding because the and long term were mid cycle we felt strongly that we should focus on restock metrics rather than as result in setting restock cash flow is an free cash flow measure calculated as net cash provided by operating minus net cash used by plus or minus for certain for important risk and other to these forward looking see the risk in our annual report on form that this proxy statement compensation the compensation committee determined that the metrics of the two mid cycle should be to with restock and the for the then current should be as below for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year and performance was measured on the plan metrics and was applied to two of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target fiscal year performance was measured on the restock metrics of restock cash flow and included in fifo operating profit growth and was applied to one third of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target similarly for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year performance will be measured on the plan metrics and will be applied to one third of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target fiscal year and performance will be measured on the restock metrics of restock cash flow and cost included in fifo operating profit growth and will be applied to two of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target with respect to the mid cycle for the then current we did not adjust the cash bonus or re issue previously performance unit we did not allow the re earning of cash and performance that were not in the year of the outstanding and we did not change the timing of the under the outstanding clark who was not executive officer at the time the plan was was eligible for different plan as below these plan are below our annual cash bonus program based on meeting financial we also the performance based annual cash bonus plan to better with our financial of restock and to simplify the way we reward our the annual plan had the following metrics id supermarket earnings per share way strategic business that support restock to further support the cost saving focus of restock for any under the way metric the company must have met its cost for our compensation philosophy and as one of the in the world our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent as

purpose to feed the human spirit to achieve our the compensation committee to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is direct link between pay and performance to do so it is by the following significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance both short and long term focus compensation should include an opportunity for and requirement of equity ownership to the of and of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the compensation committee three related regarding compensation first the compensation committee that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those who are best to be an officer at second majority of

the annual cash bonus plan is broad based plan used across the enterprise approximately receive bonus based all or in part on the bonus plan below the annual cash bonus plan had the following measurable performance metrics all of which are metric weight rationale for use id supermarket combined based on grid id supermarket represent without fuel at our that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our supermarket across the enterprise key driver of our model is strong id supermarket it is the engine that our growth earnings per share in previous we used net operating profit as performance metric as it us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we can not achieve solid net operating profit without strong operating model during the first year of restock our business plan reduction in net operating profit so we substituted earnings per share for the annual bonus plan to better motivate our across the enterprise to increase this measure of earnings growth as earnings per share were to grow in way each major business line and department way plan strategic business plan to directly support one of the four of restock each proprietary way plan both the resource allocation and the return commitment for that plan combined these form the basis for the three year restock because cost is foundational to the success of restock no can be under the way plan metric without the company cost of million regardless of the extent of the progress on the way total of metrics of

reason that the bonus were not appropriate given their assessment of company performance however no were made in that affected neo the independent that discretion for the bonus the compensation committee and the independent also discretion to adjust the for each metric under the plan should unanticipated arise during the year the actual annual cash bonus percentage for strong performance on earnings per share and performance below business plan on identical supermarket the strong link between pay and performance is by comparison of under our annual cash bonus plan in previous such as and when were particularly low in those we to achieve many of our business plan comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage this year and in prior the variability of annual cash bonus incentive
