of understanding mou with of the of the united food and commercial international union that participate in four employer pension funds we expect the to approve the mou by the mou and is contingent upon the four employer pension funds into one single employer pension fund as of the mou process that amends each of the collective between and the under which we make to these funds currently over of

investment performance of assets in the plan these will be in lieu of the prior commitment under the four funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible as of the amount under the four funds was approximately million tax we have sole investment authority under the consolidated plan while we have until march to fund our under the mou we may elect to fund approximately million tax or approximately million after tax prior to the end of the current fiscal year to take advantage of the current interest rate environment this decision on several the state of the capital and favorable determination by the rating that this transaction will not negatively affect our current debt rating because this is employer fund the million after tax if in the fourth quarter will be when and will reduce fourth quarter net earnings by approximately per diluted share the exact effect on net earnings per diluted share will depend on the contribution we make in we expect that our future operating under the consolidated employer pension fund arrangement will be significantly less than our operating would have been under the current unconsolidated employer pension funds future funded status of the consolidated employer pension fund will be determined primarily by by and the rate of return on assets by the consolidated employer pension fund capital capital excluding and the purchase of

consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting are in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for

ending after because the only affect the for employer pension the will not have material effect on our consolidated financial in the its related to the testing of goodwill for impairment the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment the option to first assess qualitative to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair

qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the unit is less than its carrying value the become effective for interim and annual beginning after however are permitted

consolidated financial in june the its the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial and to increase the prominence of in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment that all non owner in equity be either in single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate

hierarchy and disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for that are not at fair value but as to which fair value is to be disclosed the become effective for interim and annual beginning after while we are still the evaluation of the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial we believe this standard will not have material effect on our consolidated financial outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially for we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of excluding the effect of the contribution to the consolidated employer pension fund we are in the middle of the business process and full fiscal year guidance will be provided in march based on current performance we expect to produce annual net earnings per diluted share growth of to in fiscal year excluding the effect of the contribution to the consolidated employer pension fund plus dividend of to this growth rate does not factor in the week that will occur in fiscal year we expect the result of the pension arrangement to reduce fiscal year pension expense and increase net earnings by to per diluted share we will provide full guidance in march of we expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over rolling three to five year time horizon our dividend our business model is to generate total shareholder return on average of to over rolling three to five year time period we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in for the remainder of we will continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost as of the third quarter of our non fuel operating on rolling four quarters basis five basis excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge in as of the third quarter of our non fuel operating on rolling four quarters basis basis excluding lifo and the non cash goodwill impairment charge in for we expect our non fuel operating change excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge in to decline slightly for we expect our non fuel operating change excluding lifo and the non cash goodwill impairment charge in to increase slightly we expect fuel which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon in the fourth quarter of and we expect continued strong growth in total fuel sold for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on product cost inflation for in our inventory of for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we may re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be slightly above billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit and debit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year will be approximately excluding the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity and shrink we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our although we were not to make cash to the company defined benefit pension during we approximately million to these in the third quarter of we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few as we negotiate in and we do not anticipate goodwill in in the remainder of we will negotiate covering store in and with the who represent some of our in distribution and work the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work stoppage affecting substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those or is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor or industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock and the success of our future growth our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost will depend on the of our and to those our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we could fail to realize our operating per gallon of fuel and fuel sold based upon in the price of fuel change in our operating or if pattern of rapid in fuel we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate plan compensation and length of service of the of our and expense related to employer pension funds could vary from the that we expect and could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if volatility in the financial or our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the our charge for their or may decrease customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by adverse weather particularly to the extent that and other disrupt our or those of our create in the availability or in the cost of that we sell in our or and we use in our or raise the cost of energy to our various the cost of transportation the extent to which the consolidation of the pension will reduce administration and enhance for future will be affected primarily by the to the effectiveness of the consolidation of the being satisfied as well as the ability of the plan to achieve on the plan assets and to reduce through the associated with through consolidation and the ability to reduce the number of investment to provide service to the plan the amount that we contribute to the fund and the timing thereof will be affected by our ability to generate through free cash flow or other of funds the effect that our contribution to the plan will have on our fourth quarter earnings will depend on the amount and timing of our contribution as well as the number of that we have outstanding at the time of the contribution our expectation that we will have significant reduction in and expense in could prove inaccurate if our actuarial are incorrect if we are unable to make the to the plan as in or if the investment performance of the assets in the plan do not meet our whether because of in the financial or otherwise although we have received from the international union that all to the effectiveness of our agreement that must be taken by the local will occur prior to these are outside of our control and could fail to be satisfied our belief that the accelerated will not negatively affect our credit is based on that we have had with the rating but we can provide no that the rating will maintain their current outlook we can not fully foresee the effects of in economic on business we have assumed economic and competitive will not change significantly for other and not above could also cause
