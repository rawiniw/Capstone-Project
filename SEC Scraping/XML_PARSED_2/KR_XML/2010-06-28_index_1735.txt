consolidate the little clinic as wholly subsidiary item discussion and analysis of financial condition and of the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial overview first quarter total were billion with billion for the same period of this increase was attributable to identical supermarket higher average retail fuel fuel gallon and an overall increase in product cost inflation excluding fuel this increase in product cost inflation excluding fuel significant deflation in the grocery department excluding fluid milk the average price for gallon of fuel sold at our fuel was higher in the first quarter of to the first quarter of identical supermarket without fuel in the first quarter of these strong identical were while striking better balance on each one of our eighteen supermarket had positive identical growth this our trend of positive identical growth that is among the in the industry our customer to deliver solid for the first quarter of net earnings million or per diluted share to million or per diluted share for the same period of the for the first quarter of from favorable commodity this unfavorable comparison in the first quarter of was offset by from our retail fuel in the first quarter of our retail fuel by approximately per diluted share to the first quarter of based on our first quarter and better balance on we confirm our fiscal year guidance established at the end of we are striving to achieve in the upper half of the earnings guidance range and our incentive compensation plan this objective however the operating environment remains uncertain and we believe several such as inflation or deflation in product and operating the competitive environment fuel and the inconsistency of the economic recovery will continue to influence our and earnings performance throughout the year please refer to the outlook section for more information on this guidance of net earnings net earnings million for the first quarter of decrease of from net earnings of million for the first quarter of the decrease in our net earnings from operating profit which primarily from fifo gross from non fuel partially offset by higher retail fuel and in lifo interest and income tax fifo gross in the first quarter of excluding fuel to the first quarter of primarily due to continued in lower for our our net income produced earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of which decrease of over net earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of earnings per share declined due to in net earnings partially offset by the repurchase of thirteen million of our common stock over the past four quarters total in millions first quarter percentage increase percentage increase decrease total supermarket without fuel total supermarket fuel total supermarket other total other primarily relate to by convenience fuel jewelry to outside variable interest and other wholly the change in our total for the first quarter of to the first quarter of was primarily the result of identical supermarket higher average retail fuel fuel gallon and inflation in some product identical supermarket excluding fuel primarily due to transaction count as well as in average transaction and inflation in some product we define supermarket as identical when it been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel received at our fuel and based on in store are included in all of the supermarket identical below between total supermarket and identical supermarket primarily relate to in supermarket square footage identical supermarket include all at identical department our identical supermarket are in the table below we used the identical supermarket dollar to calculate first quarter percent identical supermarket in millions first quarter fuel excluding fuel fuel excluding fuel we define supermarket as comparable when it been in operation for five full quarters and as is the case for identical supermarket fuel received at our fuel and based on in store are included in all of the supermarket comparable below comparable supermarket include all at comparable department our comparable supermarket are in the table below we used the comparable supermarket dollar to calculate first quarter percent comparable supermarket in millions first quarter fuel excluding fuel fuel excluding fuel fifo gross we calculate first in first out fifo gross as minus merchandise advertising and transportation but excluding the last in first out lifo charge merchandise exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross is an important measure used by management to evaluate and operational effectiveness our fifo gross rate was for the first quarter of as to for the first quarter of retail fuel lower our fifo gross rate due to the very low fifo gross on retail fuel as to non fuel excluding the effect of retail fuel our first quarter fifo gross rate basis as percentage of to the first quarter of this decrease primarily from continued in lower for our in the first quarter of to the first quarter of operating general and administrative operating general and administrative consist primarily of employee related such as wages health care benefit and retirement plan and credit card rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in as percentage of basis to for the first quarter of from for the first quarter of primarily because our in large part due to higher average retail fuel retail fuel lower our rate due to the very low rate as percentage of of retail fuel to non fuel as percentage of excluding fuel basis in the first quarter of to the first quarter of this increase in our rate as percentage of excluding the effect of fuel primarily from health care and pension and credit offset partially by the benefit of supermarket lower utility and the benefit from productivity rent expense rent expense was million in both the first quarters of and rent expense as percentage of was in the first quarter of to in the first quarter of rent expense as percentage of excluding fuel three basis in the first quarter of to the first quarter of the decrease in rent expense as percentage of excluding fuel our continued emphasis on rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of supermarket depreciation expense depreciation expense was million or of total for the first quarter of to million or of total for the first quarter of the increase in depreciation expense in total was the result of additional depreciation on capital and lease of billion during the last rolling four quarter period ending with the first quarter of the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of to the first quarter of as percentage of is primarily due to the benefit of supermarket and higher average retail fuel excluding the effect of retail fuel depreciation as percentage of three basis point in the first quarter of to the same period of interest expense net interest expense was million or of total for the first quarter of to million or of total for the first quarter of the decrease in net interest expense for

first quarter of to million in the first quarter of the increase in the amount of cash used for for the first quarter of to the first quarter of was primarily related to the increase in on long term

of critical accounting we have chosen accounting that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating and financial position and we apply those accounting in consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting are in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could vary from those recently adopted accounting in the financial accounting board its related to fair value and which are effective for interim and annual fiscal beginning after except for about certain level activity that will not become effective until interim and annual beginning after the standard us to disclose in and out of level and level fair value and describe the for the as well as activity in level fair value the standard also more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and being measured as well as regarding and valuation of the fair value see note to the consolidated financial for our fair value and in june the its related to the consolidation of variable interest which was effective for interim and annual fiscal beginning after the standard an entity to analyze whether its variable give it financial interest of variable interest entity and what primary beneficiary the standard amends generally accepted accounting by certain whether an entity is variable interest entity the quantitative approach previously for the primary beneficiary with more qualitative approach and to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of variable interest entity among other the standard also enhanced regarding an involvement in variable interest entity the adoption of these did not have material effect on our consolidated financial outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash flow capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for in addition our shareholder return is enhanced by our dividend we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in for we will continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect non fuel operating to have slight reduction to slight improvement in rate in from excluding the non cash impairment in for we expect fuel which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel sold for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory for fiscal year we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational beginning with fiscal year we expect to reduce to fund our internal capital by approximately billion in total over the next three fiscal our original internal capital year over year continued capital expenditure growth we now expect capital to average under billion year over the next three based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit agreement and other borrowing we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation we intend to invest these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our although we are not to make cash to company defined benefit pension during we expect to contribute approximately million to these in we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next several we expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our through our company branded credit card in to be approximately million we do not anticipate additional goodwill in we have various labor that will be later in covering store in little rock and we will also negotiate with the for in upon the expiration of our collective work the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest and the inflationary and deflationary in certain commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock and the success of our future growth the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline more than if we are unable to pass on any cost fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we could fail to realize our operating per gallon of fuel and fuel sold based upon in the price of fuel change in our operating or if the pattern of rapid in fuel continue we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate
