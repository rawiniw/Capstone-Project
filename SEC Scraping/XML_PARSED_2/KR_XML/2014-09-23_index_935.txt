preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could vary from those recently

regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal year excluding the pension plan in we expect net earnings per diluted share growth of plus the dividend excluding the pension plan and the partly due to the benefit of teeter thereafter we would expect to return to our long term growth rate plus dividend that we expect to increase over time we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in fiscal year we expect full year fifo non fuel operating for excluding the pension plan to expand slightly when to excluding the excluding the and we expect our year end which will factor in full year of capital and fully reflect teeter in our calculation to show slight decline to the end of fiscal for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to improve our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from we expect capital for to increase to approximately billion excluding and of we also expect capital to increase million each year over the next few excluding and of to accomplish our strategy we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before and operational for the third and fourth quarters of we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to excluding the resolution of from certain tax we do not anticipate goodwill in for we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension funds this amount any to employer pension funds related to pension that were in the first quarter of we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of any to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate with the for store in west and in and with the covering several distribution and these will be as we must have competitive cost in each market while meeting our needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement also we must continue to address the of employer pension various and other could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward looking these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase pay and fund capital could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our ability to achieve identical earnings and cash flow may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending volatility of fuel in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the

pharmacy from third party consolidation in the industry pharmacy benefit natural or adverse weather the success of our future growth and the successful integration of teeter the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above our capital could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen during the first three quarters of our fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by year end in product our lifo charge for the fiscal year will be affected primarily by in product at year end if

rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base
