several now happy to take your and operator at this time we will begin the question and answer session to ask question you may press star then one on your telephone if you are please pick up your handset before pressing the to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and our first question will come from of so mike two first just strategically do you envision role just running directly or something more significant longer term know but think about his and that certainly can help the entire company and then what do you think particularly maybe on the fresh side you pick up here that you didnt have with teeter is it simply urban versus more suburban the company at eastern mike well first on bob he is very and excited by this transaction and he is excited to become part of our team wouldnt venture to guess what his future role will be were clearly going to need him to help drive the we expect to get both in and as we make in be part of that team together to driving better sale as well as better experience for not only our but our as well from fresh standpoint think when you go to the in there are lot of interesting that bob and his team have done in and his team have done lot of interesting with their urban and teeter and just like weve picked up from teeter think be incremental and we can pick up from bob and what done in some of the unique they do for instance some of their coffee they have local roaster come in to the and run the coffee shop thats the same guy that people see down the street so they have big focus on finding that local feel inside the store so that its more than just grocery store its an experience of other that are in and around the weve done that little bit in few theres couple in our division theres one in where we have almost food truck kind of feel inside the store where these local have section of the store where they have their product available for purchase by our and this think we had the opportunity to take that to another level all right then secondly more tactically obviously their was down in the last quarter the environment is difficult competitively but do you think and you made the comment of the are the too high today in that market for that in particularly so that needs to be reset perhaps and then going forward guess you would expect most of the growth even with that kind of market share to come from line and guess in lot of it would come from additional incremental share is that fair mike when we look at where is it very similar to journey weve been on for the last or with our customer first journey they arent starting at the beginning of where we our customer first journey made some in price would say from competitive standpoint theyre in better position today than when we our customer first journey so there will be some investment in all four of the customer first people product shopping experience and price we clearly see path where we can grow revenue particularly in with the number of they have were with the real estate theyre well situated over of these we would rate or so its great real estate we may need to invest some in infrastructure may need to invest some in some more in some of the service but those are we know how to do and can do were just really with this opportunity joining with bob and you look at like and they feel like other that in today in the whether its or or it just like home almost when there making the just the of the people the way they live and go about their daily what we do should resonate very well with them the company at eastern thank you mike you bet operator and the next question will come from kelly of credit hi this is actually on for on the following up there the million do you have any preliminary on how much is it investment in price versus labor or kind of there mike well of course we do of course wont go into that on the call we obviously need toa lot of those are done from our view of and where we think we need to go once we get regulatory approval and get this closed which will be very fast in our because we really arent in these with this kind of footprint not in at all we think well be able to hit the ground running very quickly bob he to make as you know the program recently where they took some been somewhat with the leverage had on their balance sheet to do everything he would have to do so think bob pretty good feel of exactly what he to do well also identify some and go in and refresh some of their footprint in and so the customer what were going to stand for in the future so real excited about the opportunity and for do you have around for additional expansion within and maybe going outside of the area which know bob was kind of hesitant to do in the near term mike yeah again think bob well plan of what he to do also been living with the reality of what he could do with the free cash flow that we generate on an annual basis and again would look at that the same way as would look at and how well make there well develop solid plan for both the market and the market and we feel we have ample built into our model to be able to support growth in both store count and revenue in both great thank you mike you bet the company at eastern operator and next we have question from short of bank short hi have couple of just looking at mean see your million number in the press release but curious just about overhead elimination in of the banner in general mean it would seem to me that theres considerable overhead that may go away so that your are somewhat conservative on the accretion mike yeah you always think were conservative though short yeah conservative mike is that it is that it yeah to say and at the same didnt wouldnt go down the path of overhead elimination because as we step back and look at this we want to make sure we have the right focus on the in as well and there could be some shifting of of how we are on the ground on daily basis our structure of how we manage our is little bit different than them we would have perhaps more in some of our district making sure that the are running the way we want them to run and some of the overhead could be reallocation that we believe will drive better store on regular basis which will ultimately lead to better which will ultimately lead to better generation so some of thats up in the air right now and its way too early to speculate on overhead short and then guess just looking at the legacy conventional mean obviously we all see what the are and had more recently been giving us at both and its clear that the conventional are struggling it partly to be competitive issue so guess can you maybe help us get comfortable with you think you can do and appreciate it might have been balance sheet issue from perspective in of being restricted on his mike in many when talk to their team and in kind of feel like did in the early part of the century as we were facing lot of coming into our and our were struggling certainly were struggling and until we stepped back and the customer first strategy with the four thats when really turned around now made some price there will probably be more as said theyre not as far off the market as we were when we the journey but this very much you think about this its one division thats just going to begin the customer first journey about third of the way into it and thats what us the comfort is they have to make we need to spend some money in the inside the some capital money thats built in helping us understand where we should spend that first to get the biggest bang they do have loyalty card so the richness of the data we think is going to be very robust well be able to immediately run that through the that to us and hopefully get some of the same the company at eastern benefit and out of understanding their customer data the same way we understand our customer data so theres lot of to the journey weve been on and thats one of the that us such comfort being able said it yet and the first three of you have been very kind this is closer to fixer upper that we said weve never done but we also would say the first thing we look at is people and their and the way they want to treat and we check that box the second one thats most important is the real estate in the right location and we love where the real estate is we know how to help them and they know what they need to do and well have the financial wherewithal to help them make the that just been making slowly because of the had short thats really helpful and just last quick question can you remind me how many that are currently to like in the pipeline is it five or is it several more than that mike dont have that number handy with me actually not in today do you have that know on the line in do you have that number by chance mike think that we dont have the exact commitment but clearly got three that will certainly open next year and think there are two right behind whether those are formally or not dont know mike so its single digit number but bob also where he to put some so short great thank you mike yep operator and the next question is from of great thank you so much for taking the question mike just to see if we could get little bit more detail around the debt for the transaction as understand it does have some in place that are not callable until late next year the rest of their debt is term loan should we think about you sort of looking to finance the bulk of this in the long term debt capital before year end or or are you to just use short term through the market to address some of the needs as they come up thanks mike yeah we certainly have the capacity under our credit facility to issue commercial paper to be able to execute the by the end of the year the company at eastern when we look at the debt would say that the term loan and like that will be quickly believe the have call with slight premium that actually start this they are with some against so we want to be careful not to get debt like that into the capital structure so would expect to see us to figure out how to refinance their debt in the very near term wont rush to the ill issue long term debt but wont rush to the market to do it if the market is little choppy cause do have plenty of dry powder in my revolver at very great rate and ill refinance the debt over the time when the market are right for it thats very helpful thank you mike yep operator and the next question comes from of thanks for taking my question so mike to delve further into maybe on the indiscernible diving side if you can maybe help us understand how is in natural organic and private label versus mike they have good offering of both they use third party for most of their private label we think the private label area is something that can be beneficial would be if early on in this process banner like private selection and simple truth wouldnt be some that we would look at getting into both relatively quick would say most of those and thought now that the merger we can start some high level about those of certainly when you look at the theres big emphasis on fresh and natural and organic of product and we know how well that product with love the fact that they have the richness of the data of their loyalty card to be able to understand what their are inside the store but even more importantly what they arent and how to make sure that what they arent that we know theyre probably somewhere that we can figure out way to make sure they know were going to have that product and its going to be high quality at good price so we love the fact that they have that card thats going to help us understand that great and one more question had as you look at store base what portion of that base would you consider as urban mike oh gosh just trying to get sense of the you see or what could be transported to maybe some of your other the company at eastern mike well theres urban and lots of this just urban some of this offering will play well in the right suburban too cause theres of that feel more urban the way some of these have would venture its several hundred that some of this kind of offering could wind up in the other thing is is if we take the of teeter and their urban and certainly what theyre doing with with couple as well as the area add to that the that well get from it does open up the possibility for urban in other as well where we may not have them and thats as exciting as being able to take some of the to thank you mike yep operator and our next question comes from wolf of capital wolf hi good morning mike hi good morning wolf on you just said about taking potentially taking concept to urban where you dont have so are you talking about where you literally dont have or like la where you could also have but could put in the concept or are you thinking of potentially building know its early on but just trying to clarify mike yeah would say it could potentially be either there are still lot of we arent in and we continue to look at to enter either organically or through ma but look at market like where the urban core is growing in big way and the number of people moving back downtown we really dont have store in the urban that would be the kind of store that the would want to shop in theres great store couple of away but these like to buy product if theyre going to eat at home on and they decide that at they would prefer to walk down the street to their store and think lot of these will allow us to understand how to satisfy that kind of need wolf thank you and the other question to see if you would talk about is during your due diligence did you kind of take sort of sum of the view as being very distinct from the core pick save and the so first of all yes or no and if so could you share little bit not the itself but maybe sense of the variance between the two in of you would value them the company at eastern mike well were excited with both of this chain and they both bring something to the party when look at and the around just under that in and the opportunity to grow that footprint and both the in the footprint and perhaps the footprint overall is very exciting piece of this when we get their turned around and they become positive in that could be will be very positive piece of the return of this deal thats one of the why this will be slightly accretive early on and as our mature we would expect it to be bigger contributor out into the future but were not going to force that issue early on knowing that theres we want to make wolf thank you mike operator the next question is from of research hey thanks for taking my mike sure so my first one mike is obviously the asset is great asset and think your assessment is dead on guess with the think were trading before the acquisition about on the dollar guess why now and why pay such premium if the business was this tough and it like the bond market was saying maybe they werent working out have to file so just your insight on why now why the premium mike well understand the headline premium very very high keep in mind when trading at number that with two it doesnt take much of an increase in the offer to make the premium sound very high on an equity basis its significantly different looking premium when you look on an enterprise value basis of what they closed at yesterday and what theyre trading at today think if you look at an multiple its reasonable to other that have out there with or without think the why now is sometimes these just come together at particular point in time and they still have very strong and market leadership in we know had some come in via both mart and indiscernible out of grand weve proven the ability to compete with those and its just one of those that the deal when it and know where the were trading thats only couple hundred million of the capital structure most of the debt thats out there is the term loan and it just felt like the right time and as you and have over time the people box was checked and the real estate location box the company at eastern was checked and it just came together now and were that it did and that it did and and cant wait to be able to execute some of the that done slowly and well enable him to do it little bit faster oh getting diamond in the rough with the so thats good stuff so my second question is going to be little bit over two guess once you close on the debt metrics and how do we think about other ma mean the business the industry should say is clearly some rough certainly certain we may see more assets come free maybe in the southeast maybe in other how do we think about other ma now that weve done this transaction mike yeah well still be comfortably inside our two to ratio obviously weve with the rating they understand what were doing lot of the same you all have relative to this is little bit different why now but lot of this is weve done even the teeter deal weve obviously lot of money and there so its not unusual for us to merge with chain that needs some price investment this one needs little bit more investment in the infrastructure than some of the other weve done but again we love the real estate and just really excited for this to be part of the team so does it preclude further mike would say no were comfortably inside the two to obviously with teeter we went above had the with the rating that we would manage our way back down to that ratio did it in instead the to we them were very transparent with the rating with the level of cash flow we have we have the ability to move levers around and make sure that if an opportunity comes up that we have the dry powder to take advantage of it thats perfect and then my third and final question and appreciate you taking them all is is little bit different than teeter you got the union in there they have central state pension any on that central state pension know been trying to do some work on that and just kind of that attractiveness of that market given theyre losing population so just kind of general mean think get think the one with the pension issue and some other can you maybe talk to that mike well clearly we understand the pension as well as anybody and the they have either on their balance sheet or off their balance sheet into our valuation of the entity it was certainly built into our view of value and wouldnt shy away from the market there are still plenty of there and still plenty of available and in my mind agree with your comment dont even know if would call diamond in the rough because we like lot of what done think our ability to restore the company at eastern the market to what it was few ago is the huge upside in this transaction and we feel great about our opportunity to do that particularly given the location of the the store and the ability to do what we want inside the four all right perfect thanks for taking my mike you bet operator and the next question is from vincent of morgan vincent hey good morning thanks very much for taking my question mike huh vincent to ask mike on your about the ability to grow and potentially square footage as well within if you look at the three and pick save obviously being the of them but are all three of them similar in of the level of investment the level of kind of turning around thats is it more kind of the and the or is there any kind of physical store investment as well maybe you could just kind of help us qualitatively think through the of investment mike yeah think be some of everything you be some investment in be some that between us and bob well want to get done certainly some investment in the physical assets themselves that well wind up doing we want the of to understand that theyre going to have different experience going forward and hopefully much better shopping experience would tell you its not unlike or with when we added the shopping experience indiscernible would tell you our today tell you the shopping experience at is dramatically different than it was or ago and we hope to be able to export that to and get those as excited as the rest of the that were in today indiscernible those are vincent and then just as thats helpful thank you just as quick follow up kind of can you give us sense for when the with while back you had about at some point doing market and format kind of expansion was this thought at that point or is this something thats completely separate mike yeah wont go down that path ill let file the they have to file that will document the process vincent fair enough thanks mike the company at eastern operator and the next comes from chuck of research chuck good morning everyone and to on this pending transaction mike thanks chuck hey mike could you give us an idea of what the cadence or pace might be of that million in synergy you said its over the long term but is that two to three or three to five and how much comes early rather than late but also it like much of it is going to be supply chain are those going to be in fact first and will they immediately be rolled into price and service before we see it helping the line of the overall company mike yeah wont go too far on your question chuck but obviously teeter experience very recent its given us great insight to where we would expect to find some bigger early on and were comfortable to be able to get good number of fairly quickly without any disruption to the people in the organization based on our with teeter weve gotten great amount of out of that transaction and there have been no at teeter and think well have the same experience here we know exactly where they are some of its some of its being able to buy at different price theres litany of and that well wind up getting it you just think start with the cost of being public company that goes away that chunk of money right off the so there are like that that will happen pretty quickly that will enable us to hit the ground running chuck all right thank you mike yep operator the next from joe of joe hi good morning everyone mike good morning joe lot of great and so far was that you could just come back to the real the company at eastern estate mike youve that number of just how you are with how those look curious are there are to add some fuel particularly to the legacy probably not as applicable to the urban but is this part of the overall strategy as well know that youve been quite successful in the fuel business this far mike think as we go down the path of getting this merger closed and we develop the joint strategy with bob and his team the way would look at it is everything we have in our arsenal will be on the table and well deploy those first that make the most sense are going to resonate the most as weve rolled out fuel it obviously been good for we like the business most of these are wish they were but most of them area so that usually from fuel standpoint with that in some is easier than so well develop strategy for everything thats made what is today from the four of the customer first strategy from the use of their customer data and really all the different weve done and well deploy those as it sense and we can do it you dont want to overwhelm the people either but you want to get going quickly so its fine balance there joe thats helpful and you also spoke to the inside the just how much opportunity do you have really as combined entity now potentially even accelerate the that youve been into your mike yeah well they have and we self distribute and that was nice in the teeter transaction would expect that to be one of the of synergy relative to we dont have in every market were in the process right now of trying to dense up the where we are and get the right number rather than shotgun approach of few everywhere were trying to do it more of rifle shoot to get this city done then get this city done you get that core it becomes business that you stand for not unlike fuel we dont have fuel at every location but figure out where the fuel is to their house so they can buy it and would look at the same way there are plenty of other where we dont have yet either that at some point in time would think that would be on the table to discuss as well joe great and good luck on the completion of the merger mike thanks operator and next we have question from mark of mark hi good morning the company at eastern mike hi mark mark first just to confirm that the million of is operational and kind of exclusive of get on interest expense from mike yeah its little bit of everything mark and then maybe just get your temperature mike keep in mind mark if you just step back and did the math on interest expense it up being pretty big one of the ways want to think about it is when look at the capital going to invest in this market would be charging myself for the interest on that investment so if spent million of capital wouldnt do that as interest free in the market would charge if you will the division for that interest expense so while it may go down lot quickly creep back up as deploy capital in the market and give them an interest change if that sense mark right and then maybe you could help us think about the reinvestment back into the business how much is this going to step on accretion saying slightly accretive here in near term but could we get up to like teeter level of accretion like few out mike yeah not going to speculate out into the future we have great work plan designed for the first couple of to get the business get the momentum back into and we do have bigger out into the future but wont go there at this point mark and just back to do you think theres an opportunity to take that entire business model and move it into other mean that that they target is relatively low and there is pretty low of store strategy there do you like the whole strategy got financially or do you think just be and choosing the you like as you move forward mike yeah think what us little unique in how we do these is we try to figure out the best sum of the and my guess is as we deploy be that came from teeter be that came from be that came from or name the banner fresh fare kind of store and were continually our offering and we dont stand static mean if you think about when we first did and converted the after the merger in phoenix and if you look at the of today they still say on it but theyre dramatically different as we learned over time and would think about the company at eastern how do we continue to evolve this kind of format with now multiple different of what works inside the format making the sum of the what really mark and then just strategically do you think going to be making more of push into natural organic urban now that you have more in your tool chest mike rodney often said this its probably safe to assume if theres some kind of format out there that successful you should assume were trying it or testing it somewhere we just dont talk about it mark well thank you very much mike you bet operator the next question is from of was just about to remove my question because guess ill just follow up with mark just ask you had that provided great customer experience but wasnt necessarily that profitable but dont follow is there something that you are particularly on to make that format more profitable or just your scale and best mike think its little bit of all of that and theyre with the same overhead that with mean when you think about store chain being public company just taking that public company cost and all the with it it tough tough environment to operate in frankly think thats one of the teeter was going to start to run up against as into how could they as couple hundred store chain make the they to make in to compete against as they came into that market and didnt just give share away think thats one of the tipping teeter had and when the public company like that take away the focus of wall street wondering how going to do just the overhead and expense of being public company become quite burden on just my expense of public company dramatically different its little bit higher but get to spread it over its like in computer system our system have if was chain store or store chain when spread that over now almost those of become very very affordable because the allocation to each store is so small and the benefit is so big that you can get great return on those of and would expect like that to happen not only in but as well great thank you mike yep the company at eastern operator the next question comes from of hi mike just couple of balance sheet follow up from some previous given that the million acquisition is going to elevate your leverage but keep it within the range should we expect all million to be out in the debt capital or just portion mike would say we had had bond that here recently that we off with commercial paper as well and well develop strategy for how much of that and this well term out like keeping fair amount on my commercial paper out there like being in the market on regular basis with commercial paper its obviously my form of debt and yeah realize some day interest are going to go up but commercial paper will still probably for very long time be my form of debt so we like to make sure that we are exposed all the way along the maturity curve and well be pretty thoughtful about where we place this debt one from an annual amount of as well as making sure that were exposed to different on the yield curve thats helpful and then in of timing most likely this transaction is going to close by the end of the year if it goes as were probably going to be looking for you in the market sometime after the first of the year is that reasonable expectation mike yeah ill be non committal in exactly when well access the market fair enough thank you mike yep operator the next question comes from of yes good morning mike thanks for taking my question actually have two part question and the first one actually been already through your this morning basically what was trying to ascertain was to what an extent the acquisition of was driven by strategic get into the urban market format or strengthen your present market versus turnaround story because historically you have not really done turnaround so think this one probably is little bit of mix of both is that correct assessment for that question mike mike its little bit of mix would agree with that but again go back to the real estate in the company at eastern and say decided to enter as market or just as market as weve about going into the amount of time it would take for me to get think thats what they have in the pick theres of them the time it would take me to get and the ability to get them where been for very long time would take quite while when you go into market you usually lose little bit of money early on because entering the market you have lot of overhead you have one store so if put an ad in the street its the same price to put an ad in the street for one store or so we look at this as were going into these as market but were going in with billion book of business great market share and some already and we feel we can grow from here great and then my second question mike little bit more holistic would say in nature and kind of on an question from somebody with regard to future ma interest if look at your portfolio mike am correct to recall that right now you only have kind of one format that kind of comes close to limited assortment store format food less and the reason is yesterday picked up in the press that indiscernible set up headquarters in to open their first in indiscernible and then growing very quickly thereafter now if weve seen or if we what they have done together with all the end where they have now an market share and have really caught some guess for the incumbent traditional supermarket is that format that could be of interest for you youve been very successful on the natural food side with the simple truth label do you also envision that at some point in time you may do something on the more limited assortment side of the market mike well as said in response to think question its probably safe to assume if theres something out there weve been trying it we actually have some what we call ruler that are limited assortment that we continue to try to understand whats the right offering and the right customer acceptance of those weve obviously against save lot for very long time and compete against significant number of already weve been very aware of the fact that brought the property in the area and indiscernible market we always build our business model assuming arent going to get easier that theyre probably going to continue to stay tough over time and we face lot of that kind of competition today and dont want to be dismissive of it because both and are great but we understand what them tick and we spend lot of time not just in in the us but and were with what they do but again weve continued to be successful in where we have lot of and save lots already great thank you so much for that insight mike mike yep the company at eastern operator and the next question comes from of pivotal research group yeah hi good morning thanks for taking my question my first question is just high level in of whether theres been shift in your acquisition strategy think at the recent investor conference believe you that you werent really looking to enter since teeter an opportunity to expand into the market so think that recent commentary maybe shift in your acquisition strategy to what was said back in during that investor conference so do you have any feedback mike on how might seem at least on the surface little inconsistent or might have different profile to think it was recent commentary on acquisition strategy so just wondering are you being completely opportunistic at this point or is there clearly defined strategy mike let me try to tie all the different together and going to try to make sure everybody exactly what weve been trying to say because sometimes we think weve been crystal clear but we know it can be subject to interpretation back in we did say we were interested in entering some organically then the teeter opportunity came certainly put going into market organically on the back burner they had as market and we were learning lot of how they went into that market as market organically before we were to go to one we continue to evaluate organically what we have said since the teeter merger is thats put it on little bit of back burner with that opportunity and as said in the call when you have the opportunity to enter essentially two now really three or four when you look at the market and you start out with book of business of nearly billion the that they generate already while its its with little bit of momentum and base of business behind it where you dont start at zero and going to throw off for while when you enter market so honestly dont feel as though weve been inconsistent think the conversation been about whether theres an ma opportunity or whether we enter market organically would say if anything entering market organically each time we do merger like this probably slows that thought process down little because we want to make sure the merger is successful but were not afraid to enter market via merger like this that was very helpful and actually it did tie everything together had one follow up so understand that this to be immediately accretive and so notwithstanding mike slightly slightly accretive dont get too far out there and you gave some guidance on the cost but just wondering if it could have effect on and if that impact could be material since you its going to be much more of fixer upper to teeter so just wondering so much of hit you could take on and if theres need for heavy gross investment both near term and long term the company at eastern lastly if the million of just want to confirm if thats net number after accounting for any incremental price that you might need to make thanks mike well the million would be gross and relative to the effect on overall clearly those have been negative for while and as we report these we havent about exactly how well do it its going to represent between and of our business so if theyre negative it may have or basis point drag on my supermarket if you can check my math trying to do math on an calculator and answer simultaneously sure screwed it up so dont think be very big drag on the overall number and the whole goal here is to get their turned around and get them positive great thank you operator and the next question comes from of consumer edge research was just curious with more in the market and being such consolidated geography does that change how thinking about what you might be testing in commerce and delivery versus pick up mike we have probably test of everything going on in commerce when you think about indiscernible cost and to home via that way when you think about express lane at teeter click list at or home delivery in the market so its safe to assume that we have going on of all of this as rodney said at the investor conference couple of ago this an or its not shop in the store or get home delivery we view it as and and we do believe we have to solve for how the customer to interact us on each shopping trip so if they want to come to the store today or if they want to drive by and have us put it in their or if they want it to their home we believe we need to figure out way to be able to address all of those needs for the do you think that need for in home delivery is greater in than some of the other you are currently in mike were not in so dont want to pretend know the market intimately obviously weve spent lot of time there recently would say that when you step back from it the higher use are urban like york like like so would say thats something that well have bob help us understand what his and now our in and needs are and try to figure out way to offer that to them thank you the company at eastern mike all right we have time for one more call operator that final question will come from of advisory group hey thanks for taking the question most of mine were but did want to follow up no something about the investment for the that are up there it like are in very good shape but the and can you talk about how soon get in there to really start ramping up the actual store experience and have you given thought to the level of expense that might be related to that mike well were pretty detailed plan of where we would want to go and how now that this been well start meeting with bob and his team to formalize joint plan we have particular view perhaps of where we may want to go first we want to bounce that up against the people who have been running the and who know them better to make sure we havent the mark we certainly have the ability to quickly believe quickly take their customer data run it through the that and see what that us about where their of the most loyal are that we would want to give better shopping experience to so as all these different converge one of the that we expect this to be only slightly accretive early on and we expect to reinvest lot of these is we would expect fair amount of pace to this early on got it thats helpful and the rest of my were so thanks and good luck with it conclusion mike great thanks very much and as said in her opening thanks for joining us on short notice and as always thanks for the support you all give us every day and would like to close once again all the out there for their service to the country thanks very
