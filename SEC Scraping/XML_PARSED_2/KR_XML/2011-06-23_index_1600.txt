analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial overview first quarter total were billion with billion for the same period of this increase was attributable to identical supermarket higher average retail fuel and fuel gallon the average price for gallon of fuel sold at our fuel was higher in the first quarter of to the first quarter of identical supermarket without fuel in the first quarter of identical supermarket excluding fuel primarily due to product cost inflation transaction count an increase in the average sale per shopping trip and an increase in the number of shopping with us our first quarter identical supermarket performance excluding fuel was broad based across the country each one of our eighteen supermarket had positive identical supermarket growth this our trend of positive identical supermarket growth for consecutive quarters our customer to deliver solid for the first quarter of net earnings million or per diluted share to million or per diluted share for the same period of the for the first quarter of to the first quarter of from supermarket productivity and effective cost partially offset by in lifo credit card health care and pension net earnings from our fuel consistent with the first quarter of to the first quarter of based on the strength of our for the first quarter of which is partially offset by the higher lifo charge for the year we have both the lower and upper range of our guidance for both annual identical supermarket and net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year please refer to the outlook section for more information on our our customer is to connect with we have shown that our focus on people and the shopping experience is meaningful to through both good and as result we believe the ability to create and deliver shareholder value in variety of operating is key part of our value proposition for of net earnings net earnings million for the first quarter of an increase of from net earnings of million for the first quarter of the increase in our net earnings for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from an increase in non fuel operating profit partially offset by higher effective tax rate net earnings from our fuel consistent with the first quarter of to the first quarter of the increase in non fuel operating profit for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from the benefit of supermarket productivity and effective cost partially offset by in our lifo charge credit card health care and pension net earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of an increase of over net earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of net earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of to the first quarter of due to net earnings and the repurchase of million of our common stock over the past four quarters total in millions percentage increase percentage increase total supermarket without fuel total supermarket fuel total supermarket other total other primarily relate to by convenience fuel jewelry to outside variable interest and in store health the increase in total and total supermarket for the first quarter of to the first quarter of was primarily the result of our identical supermarket increase excluding fuel of and an increase in supermarket fuel of total supermarket fuel over the same period in due to increase in average retail fuel and increase in fuel sold the increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was by an increase in the product cost of fuel identical supermarket excluding fuel primarily due to product cost inflation transaction count an increase in the average sale per shopping trip and an increase in the number of shopping with us we define supermarket as identical when it been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel received at our fuel and based on in store are included in all of the supermarket identical below between total supermarket and identical supermarket primarily relate to in supermarket square footage identical supermarket include all at identical department our identical supermarket are in the table below we used the identical supermarket dollar to calculate first quarter percent identical supermarket in millions fuel excluding fuel fuel excluding fuel fifo gross we calculate first in first out fifo gross as minus merchandise advertising and transportation but excluding the last in first out lifo charge merchandise exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross is an important measure used by management to evaluate and operational effectiveness our fifo gross rate was for the first quarter of as to for the first quarter of retail fuel lower our fifo gross rate due to the very low fifo gross on retail fuel as to non fuel excluding the effect of retail fuel our first quarter fifo gross rate basis as percentage of to the first quarter of this decrease in the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from continued in lower for our and higher diesel fuel related to our logistics offset partially by favorable shrink lifo charge the lifo charge was million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of the lifo charge in the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily due to our increase in product cost inflation in most major for to operating general and administrative operating general and administrative consist primarily of employee related such as wages health care benefit and retirement plan and credit card rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in as percentage of basis to for the first quarter of from for the first quarter of primarily due to the benefit of supermarket and higher average retail fuel retail fuel lower our rate due to the very low rate as percentage of of retail fuel to non fuel as percentage of excluding fuel basis in the first quarter of to the first quarter of this decrease in our rate as percentage of excluding the effect of fuel primarily from the benefit of supermarket productivity and effective cost offset partially by credit card and health care and pension rent expense rent expense was million in both the first quarters of and rent expense as percentage of was in the first quarter of to in the first quarter of rent expense as percentage of excluding fuel five basis in the first quarter of to the first quarter of the decrease in rent expense as percentage of excluding fuel our continued emphasis on rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of supermarket depreciation expense depreciation expense was million or of total for the first quarter of to million or of total for the first quarter of the increase in depreciation expense in total was the result of additional depreciation on capital and lease of billion during the last rolling four quarter period ending with the first quarter of the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of to the first quarter of as percentage of is primarily due to the benefit of supermarket and higher average retail fuel excluding the effect of retail fuel depreciation as percentage of two basis in the first quarter of to the same period of interest expense net interest expense was million or of total for the first quarter of to million or of total for the first quarter of the increase in net interest expense for the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily from higher weighted average debt balance and decrease in the benefit from interest rate income our effective income tax rate was for the first quarter of and for the first quarter of the and effective income tax from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income liquidity and capital cash flow information net cash provided by operating we billion of cash from operating during the first quarter of to billion in the first quarter of the cash provided by operating came from net earnings noncontrolling for non cash and in working capital in working capital provided cash from operating of million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of this decrease in the change in working capital was primarily due to an increase in in the first quarter of to decrease in the first quarter of this increase in was primarily due to decision not to fund our voluntary employee benefit account at the end of fiscal year to million at the end of fiscal year the amount of cash for income in the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily due to an overpayment of applied to net cash used by we used million of cash for during the first quarter of to million during the first quarter of the amount of cash used for in the first quarter of versus primarily due to cash for capital net cash used by we used billion of cash for in the first quarter of to million in the first quarter of the increase in the amount of cash used for for the first quarter of to the first quarter of was primarily related to the increase in treasury stock offset partially by on long term debt and our investment in the interest of variable interest entity in the first quarter of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from of employee stock debt management as of may we billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended on may outstanding under the credit agreement and commercial paper and some outstanding of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we three uncommitted money market million in the aggregate the money market allow us to borrow from at mutually agreed upon usually at below the under the credit agreement as of may we had no under our credit agreement money market or outstanding commercial paper the outstanding of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement million as of may our bank credit facility and the underlying our publicly debt contain various restrictive as of may we were in compliance with these financial furthermore management it is not reasonably likely that will fail to comply with these financial in the foreseeable future total debt both the current and long term of capital and lease million to billion as of the end of the first quarter of from billion as of the end of the first quarter of total debt million as of the end of the first quarter of from billion as of year end the decrease as of the end of the first quarter of to the end of the first quarter of from the payment at maturity in the first quarter of of million of senior bearing an interest rate of partially offset by the issuance in the second quarter of of million of senior bearing an interest rate of as of may our cash and temporary cash were million to million as of this decrease was primarily due to the share repurchase activity noted below common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of we million to repurchase million of stock at an average price of per share these were under three separate stock repurchase the first was million repurchase program that was authorized by board of on june the second is billion repurchase program the first program that was authorized by board of on march the third is program that the cash proceeds from the of stock by in stock option and long term incentive as well as the associated tax liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately billion which for working capital capital interest and principal of debt offset by cash and temporary cash on hand at the end of the first quarter of based on current operating we believe that cash from operating and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve in addition to the of liquidity noted above we also expect to be able to fund future principal of long term debt from our cash from operating and if necessary by issuing additional debt we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to maintain our current debt and to respond effectively to competitive capital capital excluding and the purchase of million for the first quarter of to million for the first quarter of during the first quarter of we acquired expanded or ten food and also within the wall total food store square footage from the first quarter of excluding and operational total food store square footage in the first quarter of as to the first quarter of capital for the purchase of million in the first quarter of to million in the first quarter of critical accounting we have chosen accounting that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating and financial position and we apply those accounting in consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting are in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could vary from those recently adopted accounting in the financial accounting board its related to fair value and which were effective for interim and annual fiscal beginning after except for about certain level activity that effective for interim and annual beginning after the require us to disclose in and out of level and level fair value and describe the for the as well as activity in level fair value the also require more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and being measured as well as regarding and valuation of the fair value we adopted the effective except for about certain level activity we adopted the for about certain level activity effective see note to the consolidated financial for our fair value and outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash flow capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for based on the current operating environment we expect to achieve near the end of this range this range the strength of our first quarter and the higher lifo charge of million we expect the second and third quarter earnings per diluted share growth to be near the low end of our full year earnings per share growth due to tax in we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in for we will continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we would expect slight increase in non fuel operating for to excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge assuming net earnings per diluted share is near the end of our range for for we expect fuel which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in total fuel sold for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on product cost inflation for in our inventory of for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we may re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity and shrink we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our we do not expect to make cash contribution to the company defined benefit pension during if contribution is made to the company defined benefit pension we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few as we negotiate in and we do not anticipate additional goodwill in we have various labor that will be in covering store in southern and west we will also negotiate with the who represent some of our in distribution and in the upon the expiration of our collective work the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in we expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over rolling three to five year time horizon our dividend our business model is to generate total shareholder return on average of to over rolling three to five year time period various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor or industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock and the success of our future growth our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost will depend on the of our and to those our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we could fail to realize our operating per gallon of fuel and fuel sold based upon in the price of fuel change in our operating or if pattern of rapid in fuel we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate plan compensation and length of service of our and expense related to employer pension funds could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if volatility in the financial or our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may
