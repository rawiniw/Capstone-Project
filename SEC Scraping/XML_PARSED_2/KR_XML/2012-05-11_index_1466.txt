not readily apparent from other actual could differ from those we believe that the following accounting are the most critical in the preparation of our financial because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex about the effect of that are inherently uncertain self insurance we primarily are self insured for related to compensation and general liability the represent our best estimate generally accepted actuarial of the ultimate for plus those but not for all through we establish case for case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both compensation and general liability we have stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on per claim basis we are insured for covered in excess of these per claim we account for the for compensation on present value basis risk discount rate basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability are not we are also similarly self insured for property related we have stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to in excess of million on per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stop loss coverage is in excess of million per claim up to million per claim in and million outside of the underlying the ultimate of claim are subject to high degree of which can affect the liability for such for example variability in inflation of health care inherent in these can affect the similarly in legal and as well as change in the nature and method of how are settled can affect ultimate our of do not anticipate significant in historical for these and any could have considerable effect on future claim and currently of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger have these include current period combined with history of or projection of or significant decrease in the market value of an asset when trigger event we perform an impairment calculation undiscounted cash current cash flow information and growth related to specific to the carrying value for those if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market or future cash we record impairment when the carrying value fair market value with respect to property and equipment for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable based on our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value reduced by direct of disposal we asset in the normal course of business million in million in and million in included in the amount are asset million for the unit in southern we record to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest collectively our with goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and excluding goodwill to estimate an fair value of the goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value the annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment the annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of in an impairment charge of million based on the of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of supermarket unit with small number of potential impairment due to future cash being lower than in the past our fair value of the unit we that the carrying value of goodwill for this unit its fair value resulting in tax impairment charge of million million after tax in we disclosed that reduction in fair value of this supermarket unit would indicate potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this unit in the third quarter of our operating performance due to deflation and intense competition during the third quarter of based on for and the initial of our annual budget process of the supermarket management that there were evident to warrant impairment testing of these in the third quarter of we did not test the variable interest with goodwill for impairment as no event based on the of our step one analysis in the third quarter of the unit in southern was the only unit for which there was potential impairment in the operating performance of the unit was significantly affected by the economic at the time and to competitive in southern as result of this decline in current and future cash along with comparable fair value information management that the carrying value of goodwill for the unit its fair value resulting in tax impairment charge of after tax subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the unit management used an equal weighting of cash and weighted multiple to estimate fair value the cash assumed long term growth comparable to historical performance and discount rate of in addition the in the declined since those used in the assessment based on current and future cash the company additional goodwill are not reasonably likely for additional information to our of the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the noncancellable lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future or that no longer is for its originally intended purpose is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we inventory write in connection with store if any in merchandise we expense to transfer inventory and equipment from closed as they are post retirement benefit we account for our defined benefit pension the recognition and disclosure of which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement on the consolidated balance sheet we record as component of other comprehensive income actuarial gains or prior service or and transition that have not yet been the determination of our obligation and expense for company pension and other post retirement is dependent upon our selection of used by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount as of year end was to match the cash to that of yield curve that the equivalent on zero coupon corporate for each maturity benefit cash due in particular year can theoretically be settled by them in the zero coupon bond that in the same year the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively represent the equivalent single under broad market aa yield curve we discount rate of and for year end for pension and other respectively basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately million to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and plan asset as well as historical and of return on various asset for and we assumed pension plan investment return rate of our pension average rate of return was for the calendar ended net of all investment management and the value of all in our company defined benefit pension during the calendar year ending net of investment management and for the past our average annual rate of return been the average annual return for the over the same period of time been based on the above information and forward looking for made in manner consistent with our target we believe an rate of return assumption is reasonable see note to the consolidated

to us we believe that the present value of actuarially in most of these employer substantially the value of the assets in trust to pay we have to estimate the amount by which these exceed the assets the amount of as of because is only one of number of to these we also have to estimate the ratio of to the total of all to these in year as way of share of the nonetheless the is not direct obligation

million tax or million after tax as of to the estimate of our the effect of our million contribution to the consolidated pension plan made in the decrease in the amount of is attributable to the million contribution to the consolidated pension plan partially offset by in in other our estimate is based on the most current information available to us actuarial and other data that include the of

expect to contribute approximately million to our employer pension subject to collective and capital market this amount contribution decrease due to the consolidated pension plan based on current

could trigger substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be when it is probable that liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and future expense would be favorably affected if the of the assets in the trust significantly increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand share of the could increase and future expense could be adversely affected if

credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve we have approximately billion of debt due in the next twelve which is included in the billion in liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt on favorable based on our past experience if necessary we believe we can also fund future principal of long term debt from our cash from operating we also currently do not expect to purchase our common at the we did in we used our commercial paper program toward the end of to fund our common share we expect our to the consolidated pension plan to significantly decrease in future we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt in but do not expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to maintain our current debt and to respond effectively to competitive affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper program at we had million of outstanding are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit fall the ability to borrow under our current program could be adversely affected for period of time and increase our interest cost on daily under our program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our program would be any lower than million on daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio our credit facility the maintenance of leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio our financial failure to maintain our financial would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial and are below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated as defined in the credit facility was to as of if this ratio were to exceed to we would be in default of

amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment the option to first assess qualitative to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of unit is less than its carrying value as basis for whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test the two step impairment test is now only if an entity through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the unit is less than its carrying value the are effective for interim and annual beginning after however were permitted to adopt the early we did not adopt these early for our goodwill impairment testing process because the measurement of potential impairment loss not the will not have an effect on our consolidated financial in june the its regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial and to increase the prominence of in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment that all non owner in equity be either in single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive the were to become effective for interim and annual beginning after in the deferred certain of this standard beyond the effective date specifically the dealing with reclassification because the only affect the display of comprehensive income and do not affect what is included in comprehensive income the will not have material effect on our consolidated financial in may the its related to fair value and the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value and disclosed in financial prepared in accordance with and international financial this amendment primarily the wording used to describe many of the in for measuring fair value and for information about fair value in addition the amendment the intent about the application of fair value measurement the standard also additional related to fair value within level of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for that are not at fair value but as to which fair value is to be disclosed the effective for interim and annual beginning after while we are still our evaluation of the effect of this standard on our consolidated financial we believe this standard will not have material effect on our consolidated financial outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for this guidance the benefit of the week lower lifo charge the benefit of our share program during the benefit from the pension plan consolidation and the benefit from of to our from that previously used former third party pharmacy provider to obtain their express we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in this guidance the effect of several brand prescription coming off patent during which will reduce because generic have lower retail price our business model is designed to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over rolling three to five year time horizon our dividend our business model is designed to generate total shareholder return on average of to over rolling three to five year time period in annual earnings per diluted share growth are to be higher than this due to combination of the benefit of the week lower lifo charge the benefit of our share program during the from the pension plan consolidation and the benefit from express prescription for we intend to continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer st strategy by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect fifo non fuel operating for to expand slightly to excluding the consolidated pension plan charge in for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million to million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we intend to continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate and logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our although we are not to make cash to the company defined benefit pension during we expect to contribute approximately million to these in we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few we do not anticipate additional goodwill in we have various labor that will be in covering store in las and phoenix and upon the expiration of our collective work by the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work stoppage affecting substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor or industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock the effect of brand prescription going off patent our ability to obtain additional pharmacy from third party such as express the that we receive from the consolidation of the pension and the success of our future growth our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost will depend on the of our and to those our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of the of our and expense related to employer pension funds could vary from the that we expect and could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if volatility in the financial or our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year
