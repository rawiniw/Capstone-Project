free cash flow and cost included in fifo operating profit growth with return on capital modifier we are metric based on the cost in the achievement of operating profit growth because cost is essential to fund the strategic that will produce the operating profit growth we believe it is more meaningful metric than operating profit growth itself because it us to focus on the that we need to support sustainable incremental operating profit growth since we grant three year long term incentive plan each year at any one time there are three outstanding as we are mid cycle in the and long term we feel strongly that we should focus on restock metrics rather than as result the compensation committee determined that the metrics of the mid cycle should be to with restock for the outstanding long

on the restock metrics of free cash flow and included in fifo operating profit growth and will be applied to one third of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target similarly for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year performance will be measured on the plan metrics and will be applied to one third of the previously cash and performance unit bonus target fiscal year and

our strong focus on we are responsible of the environment the board that issuing report on renewable energy would be unnecessary and would consume time and that are best spent on on our and we urge you to support the of our current and vote against this proposal shareholder chairman we have been notified by one shareholder the name and of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at our executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting resolved of the ask the board of to adopt policy and amend the as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent member of the board this policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation the policy should provide that if the board that chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select chair who the policy within days of that determination and compliance with this policy is if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair supporting statement except for brief apprenticeship at the outset of their service have also the role of board chair for many we believe the combination of these two in single person governance which can harm shareholder value as former chair grove stated the separation of the two goes to the heart of the conception of corporation is company sandbox for the or is the an employee if an employee he needs boss and that boss is the board the chairman the board how can the be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide balance of power between the and the board and support strong board oversight proxy advisor glass lewis in report that are better when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the of the company and set pro shareholder agenda without the management that exist when or other executive also as chairman content in depth report independent board chairman an independent board chair been found in academic to improve the performance of public although evidence overall is inconclusive while separating the of chair and is the norm in of company have also this best practice media research and insight spencer us board index we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly useful at in providing more robust oversight regarding we agree with the recent by state street global that long term horizon focus on and that are often better than the day to day management to see these over longer time investment environmental social governance long term value be at the board eu to risk its reputation by selling produce with group of highly toxic to bees to join the fair food program to ensure equitable treatment of farm also risk associated with its to the of food production on deforestation independent board leadership would we think more likely result in and to mitigate these business we urge to vote for this proposal the board of vote against this proposal for the following the board should have the flexibility to determine the structure to needs at any time separating or combining the of chairman and board is structured to provide the most effective leadership for our our are best when the company the flexibility to select the appropriate person to serve in the role given the of the retail food the board that the rigid one all proposal is not in the best interest of and should be balanced governance structure in which independent an independent lead director exercise meaningful and vigorous oversight board is led by strong independent lead director who the same as chairman and the that the proposal independent lead director robust that ensure strong independent and active board that the role the lead robust and are in detail in the which are available at the lead director variety of and all board meeting meeting and schedule serving as liaison between the chairman and the independent at the regularly executive sessions of independent and of the board when the chairman is not present calling an executive session of the independent at any time and serving as the representative for any consultation and direct communication if by major while our current chairman is also the this structure is reflection of the current view that both and our would not be best by separation the at this time given the important and industry that our to the board particularly given current transformation under the restock plan however the board routinely leadership structure which discussion of performance the impact that the leadership on that performance and the structure that best the of our strong governance ensure our independent leadership and oversight the board and in addition to the independent lead director that create balanced governance system of independent and effective oversight all of board are independent except for the all of each of the board are independent the full board of independent annually evaluate the performance led by the independent lead director the full board and each committee annual self the board is to board refreshment and diversity and the board and each of its have unfettered access to management and the authority to retain independent as they deem appropriate contrary to the in the supporting statement there is no established consensus that separating the of the chairman and the is best practice or that such separation for the of school of business article splitting up the of and chairman reform or red herring knowledge article that there is no evidence that separating the of chairman and corporate performance in corporate governance update of board composition and laura york law journal the that from board effectiveness perspective there is no need to separate the of chairman and so long as there is an effective lead director in place in addition the majority of have not the structure by the proposal the board will continue to review leadership structure to ensure that the structure best and dynamic business in consultation with the current board and our the board that
