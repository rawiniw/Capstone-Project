the average trade payable the average and wages and the average other current are calculated for return on capital by the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is common factor used by our and rating is non financial measure of performance should not be in isolation or considered as substitute for our financial as in accordance with is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment on capital management is useful metric to and because it how effectively we are our assets all included in the calculation of are excluding certain to operating income although is relatively standard financial term numerous exist

critical accounting we have chosen accounting that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating and financial position and we apply those accounting in consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting are in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could vary from those recently adopted accounting in the its on comprehensive income by disclosure of information about out of other comprehensive income by component specifically the amendment disclosure of the effect of significant out of on the respective line in net income in which the item was if the amount being is to be to net income in its entirety in the same period it cross reference to other that provide additional detail for that are not to be in their entirety in the same period this disclosure effective for us beginning and is being adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard see note to the consolidated financial for the related to this standard in the its related to assets and this amendment to disclose both gross and net information about certain and eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain and subject to an agreement similar to master netting agreement this information is intended to enable of the financial to understand the effect of these on our financial position the effective for us on in the further this standard to limit its scope to repurchase and reverse repurchase and see note to the consolidated financial for the related to this standard recently accounting in the accounting codification income the provide guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either reduction of deferred tax asset or as liability when net operating loss similar tax loss or tax credit the will be effective for interim and annual beginning after and may be applied on retrospective basis early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of these to have significant effect on our consolidated financial position or of outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance excluding the potential merger with teeter these are based on and in light of the information currently available such are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal year excluding certain tax and the effect of the pending teeter merger looking forward to we expect net earnings per diluted share growth of excluding the effect of the pending teeter merger and tax which is consistent with our long term growth strategy we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of for the fourth quarter of we expect fifo non fuel operating for to expand slightly to excluding the in fiscal and the and for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from we expect capital for to increase to approximately billion excluding and of we also expect capital to increase million each year over the next few excluding and of to accomplish our strategy we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before and operational we expect that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of will be approximately excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax and from certain tax we do not anticipate goodwill in various and other could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward looking these include the specific risk in the annual report on form for the fiscal year ended and any subsequent filings as well as the following the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase pay and fund capital could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our ability to achieve earnings and cash flow may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock the effect of brand prescription going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy from third party natural or adverse weather and the success of our future growth the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above during the first three quarters of the year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by year end in product our lifo charge for the year will be affected primarily by in product at year end if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase we can not fully foresee the effects of in economic on business we have assumed economic and competitive will not change significantly during the remainder of other and not above could also cause actual to differ materially from those set forth in the
