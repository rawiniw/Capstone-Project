share of which the consolidated pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter of and the extra week in the fourth quarter of we expect the second and third quarter net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be at the high end of the to range or above the range primarily because we expect inflation in the second and third quarters of to be comparable to the second and third quarters of we also expect the fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share on week to week basis to be lower than prior year primarily due to lifo charge of million to lifo credit of million in the fourth quarter of we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in our long term business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth plus an dividend over time that

above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings in the and of that compete with us are likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent

the financial or for other our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may decrease customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the cost our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by natural or adverse weather particularly to the extent that they disrupt our or those of our create in the availability or in the cost of that we sell in our or and we use in our or raise the cost of energy to our various the cost of transportation we can not fully foresee the effects of in economic on business we have
