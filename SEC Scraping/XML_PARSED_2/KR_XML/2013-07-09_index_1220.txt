looking more closely at their footprint and ours you will see they have in many attractive high growth for example of its teeter today in north in the area in south three in the area in the area which is the market four in the market three in as well as one store each in and we will have minor overlap in and and we are making now as to how we will operate in each of these over the long term we are excited about entering which include vibrant and growing major urban such as and several other metropolitan in the and affluent vacation and university teeter in several with growing faster than the national average complementary core we see lot of opportunity to learn from one another and many ways that our combination will benefit each organization we plan to bring to teeter the that does very well our power information and loyalty with the world class customer firm this merger footprint into growing we also believe the entire organization will benefit from in operating urban upscale and

this strategy integration upon regulatory approval we will have from both work to bring out the best of both we take integration very seriously and will work hard to capture all the of transaction for teeter our and our and successful merger history is based on joining with with an established brand in their brand is exceptional to be locally relevant retailer and we believe this is one of many following teeter will continue to operate its as subsidiary of the and will continue to be led by key of senior management team know that many for both want to know the for their while there are operational that are still to be in the coming we see teeter as strong merchant and expect to grow their franchise just as we expect to continue to grow franchise we have no to close and will continue to have employment with both we will examine everything in the context of the growth when the transaction we will be in position to share more about our for now can say that we would like to keep everything about teeter that made the company the highly successful supermarket operator it is financial overview finally will outline the financial of the merger capital structure we will finance the deal with debt also to assume outstanding debt of approximately million we expect to access the capital in the next few to refinance the that this year and then closer to issue debt at different to finance the merger this will allow us to set up our capital structure to have exposure at various along the yield curve and balance our fixed and floating rate exposure we have bridge loan commitment in place to provide us the liquidity to fund the transaction both and teeter have strong track of cash to consistent with this long term commitment to continue its quarterly dividend and share repurchase program while free cash flow to reduce the leverage taken on from this merger although the ratio will increase at the time the merger to allocate some free cash flow to debt reduction to re establish and maintain its net debt to ratio over the next the company is to its current investment grade credit rating accretion and the effect of some free cash flow to debt reduction we expect net accretion to earnings per diluted share in the range of in the first full year after the merger excluding transition and transaction to maintain its current long term net earnings per share growth rate off of this higher earnings base we expect to achieve total run rate of approximately to million in annual cost over the next three to four much of the is to come from the of scale strong history of synergy by us being patient in those the risk of the transaction and the stage for sustainable growth the merger is subject to customary and regulatory approval the transaction also is subject to teeter shareholder vote which will require approval from majority of the outstanding conclusion as you can see this transaction is compelling for from financial and strategic standpoint one that will
