in note to the consolidated financial the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other

the effect of that are inherently uncertain self insurance we primarily are self insured for related to compensation and general liability the represent our best estimate generally accepted actuarial of the ultimate for plus those but not for all through we establish case for case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both compensation and general liability we have stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on per claim basis we are insured for covered in excess of these per claim we account for the for

potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger have these include current period combined with history of or projection of or significant decrease in the market value of an asset when trigger event we perform an impairment calculation undiscounted cash current cash flow information and growth related to specific to the carrying value for those if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market or future cash we record impairment when the carrying value fair market value with respect to property and equipment for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable based on our previous to dispose of similar assets

in and million in included in the amount are asset million for southern unit we record to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest with goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of division against the fair value of its underlying assets and excluding goodwill to estimate an fair value of the goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value in the third quarter of our operating performance due to persistent deflation and intense competition based on our forecast during the third quarter of and the initial of our annual budget process for the supermarket management that there were evident to warrant impairment testing at these we did not test for impairment our variable interest with goodwill as no event the unit in southern was the only unit for which there was potential impairment the operating performance of the unit was significantly affected by economic and to competitive in southern as result of this decline in current and future cash along with comparable fair value information management that the carrying value of goodwill for the unit its fair value resulting in an impairment charge subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the unit management used an equal weighting of cash and weighted multiple to estimate fair value the cash assume long term growth comparable to historical and discount rate of in addition the in the declined since those used in the assessment we our annual assessment in the fourth quarter for all supermarket and variable interest entity vie with goodwill based on current and future cash we believe additional goodwill are not reasonably possible reduction in fair value of our would not indicate potential for impairment of our goodwill balance except for one supermarket unit and one vie unit with goodwill of million and million respectively for additional information to our of the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the noncancellable lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future or that no longer is for its originally intended purpose is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on

by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount as of year end was to match the cash to that of yield curve that the equivalent on zero coupon corporate for each maturity benefit cash due in particular year can theoretically be settled by them in the zero coupon bond that in the same year the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively represent the equivalent single under broad market aa yield curve we discount rate of for year end for both pension and other basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately million to determine the return on pension plan assets we consider current and plan asset as well as historical and on various asset for and we

liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and future

the interest cost on under the credit facility could be affected by decrease in our credit rating or decrease in our applicable percentage ratio our credit facility also the maintenance of leverage

million based on the underlying this indebtedness as of it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these we have also agreed to guarantee up to million the indebtedness of an entity in which we have ownership interest our share of the responsibility as of should the entity be unable to meet its approximately million and is by approximately million of inventory in our we consolidate this entity because we are the primary beneficiary and therefore the entire million is liability on the consolidated balance we also are contingently liable for that have been assigned to various third in connection with facility and we could be to satisfy under the if any of the are unable to fulfill their lease due to the wide distribution of our among third and various other available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be to assume material amount of these is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics for certain pension trust fund contribution and withdrawal in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification and take on indemnification in the ordinary course of business such include against third party out of to

hedging the are included in note to the consolidated financial effective we adopted the that clarify that share based payment that entitle their to receive nonforfeitable before vesting should be considered and included in the computation of pursuant to the two class method see note to the consolidated financial for further discussion of its adoption effective we adopted related to business the expand the of business and the fair value measurement and in business combination all business after will be for under the effective we adopted that deferred the fair value for most non financial assets and non financial to fiscal beginning after see note to the consolidated financial for further discussion of the adoption of the in the its for noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership with respect to the subsidiary the standard noncontrolling interest previously minority interest as the portion of equity in subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to parent the standard among other that noncontrolling interest be clearly and in the consolidated balance sheet as equity but separate from the equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly and on the face of the consolidated statement of income and that if subsidiary is the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent in the former subsidiary and recognize gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the non equity investment we adopted the standard effective and applied it retrospectively as result we noncontrolling in of from the mezzanine section to equity in the consolidated balance sheet certain to the consolidated of have been made to prior period to conform to the presentation of the current period under the standard for prior previously as net earnings which are now as net earnings attributable to the have not as result of the adoption of the standard effective we adopted the related to about in these require additional about an involvement with and of financial assets the adoption of these did not change any in our consolidated financial due to our being immaterial recently accounting in june the its to change how company when an entity that is insufficiently or is not through voting or similar should be consolidated the will become effective for our fiscal year beginning while we are still the evaluation of the impact of these on our consolidated financial we believe these will not have material effect on our consolidated financial in the guidance that amends and guidance related to fair value and this guidance for in and out of level and level and for such and the separate presentation of and settlement in the level reconciliation it also guidance around disaggregation and of and valuation for level and level fair value this guidance is effective for our first quarter of except for the in the level reconciliation the level are effective for our first quarter of we do not expect that this guidance will have material impact on our consolidated financial outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash flow capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in for we will continue to focus on driving growth and balancing in gross and customer service to provide better shopping experience for our we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect non fuel operating to have slight reduction to slight improvement in rate in from excluding the non cash impairment for we expect fuel which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel sold for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage and to pay cash as market change we plan to re evaluate the above of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology the continued capital spending in technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and should reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before and operational we expect to reduce our internal capital by approximately billion in total over the next three fiscal our original internal capital year over year continued capital expenditure growth we now expect capital to average under billion year over the next three based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit agreement we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation these will be in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our although we are not to make cash to company defined benefit pension during we expect to contribute approximately million to these in we expect any elective made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect our cash and expense to the retirement account plan from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective and capital market in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next five but we believe it unlikely that will double during that period which is change from our estimate at year end we expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our through our company branded credit card in to be approximately million we believe no additional goodwill will be reasonably possible in we have various labor that will be in covering store in little rock and we will also negotiate with the for in and upon the expiration of our collective work the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us if market change it could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor industry consolidation and promotional of and non traditional our response to these the state of the economy interest and the inflationary and deflationary in certain commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic stock and the success of our future growth the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating persistent deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical store growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline more than if we are unable to pass on any cost fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we could fail to realize our operating per gallon of fuel and fuel sold based upon in the price of fuel or change in our operating we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of rate plan compensation and length of service of our and expense related to employer pension funds could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if weakness in the financial or our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in the general business and economic in our operating the rate of inflation population growth and employment and job growth in the in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified to operate our this would negatively affect earnings and growth in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next three fiscal could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology are not in the time frame or on budget or if current operating fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in the credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for company pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may decrease the customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the cost our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by adverse weather particularly to the extent that and other disrupt our or those of our create in the availability or in the cost of that we sell in our or and we use in our or raise the cost of energy to our various the cost of transportation other and not above could also cause actual to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information accordingly actual and may vary significantly from those included in or by forward looking made by us or our item quantitative and qualitative about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial primarily to manage our exposure to in interest and to lesser extent adverse in commodity and other market we do not enter into derivative financial for trading as matter of policy all of our derivative are
