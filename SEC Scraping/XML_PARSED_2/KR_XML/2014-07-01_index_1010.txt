accounting codification income the amendment guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either reduction of deferred tax asset or as liability when net operating loss similar tax loss or tax credit this amendment effective beginning and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on net income and did not have effect on our consolidated balance sheet recently accounting in may the accounting update revenue from with which guidance for revenue recognition the core principle is that company will recognize revenue when it goods or to in an amount that the consideration to which it to be in exchange for those goods or this guidance will be effective in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending we are currently in the process of the impact of adoption of this on our consolidated financial outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance teeter these are based on and in light of the information currently available such are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal year excluding the pension plan in we expect net earnings per diluted share growth of plus the dividend excluding the pension plan and the partly due to the benefit of teeter thereafter we would expect to return to our long term growth rate plus dividend that we expect to increase over time we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in fiscal year we expect the full year fifo non fuel operating increase in excluding the pension plan to be higher than our long term guidance which is slightly expanding when to excluding the partially due to teeter not being included in the base year of for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to improve our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from we expect capital for to increase to approximately billion excluding and of we also expect capital to increase million each year over the next few excluding and of to accomplish our strategy we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before and operational for we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the unexpected effect of the resolution of any tax and from certain tax we do not anticipate goodwill in for we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension funds this amount any to employer pension funds related to pension that were in the first quarter of we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of any to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate with the for store in food less in west and and an agreement with the covering several distribution and these will be as we must have competitive cost in each market while meeting our needs for good wages and affordable health care also we must continue to address the of employer pension various and other could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward looking these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase pay and fund capital could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our ability to achieve identical earnings and cash flow may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and

caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock the effect of brand prescription going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy from third party natural or adverse weather the success of our future growth and the successful integration of teeter the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above during the first three quarters of our fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by year end in product our lifo charge for the fiscal year will be affected primarily by in product at year end if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable
