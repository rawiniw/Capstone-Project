contrast to its to make little forward progress in renewable energy adoption this shareholder resolution that evaluate adoption of enterprise wide renewable energy to reduce its carbon risk rationale for yes vote to disclose information to assess how or whether the company is adequately carbon risk or renewable energy portfolio into the future does not currently report any climate related beyond the target setting as found in remains and unclear providing data with moving and that while to be significant actually encompass relatively small while any reduction effort by the company is laudable the energy reduction goal for in on now year old therefore this goal as will result in reduction of the energy use by in total between and an anemic year furthermore in recent the company increasing greenhouse gas emission into question if the company will even reach its minimal early between now and similarly goal of improving transportation fuel efficiency by is little different from business as usual given current fuel economy improvement goal federal that require increase in fuel efficiency of heavy by fuel efficiency goal to simply track the vehicle replacement schedule finally the on

between and or roughly per year which by the by this proposal report considering the feasibility of renewable energy target is an important first step in assuring that our company is working to effectively remedy its climate risk climate change to that remain insufficiently increasing renewable energy adoption will reduce those and benefit the company unlike many today annual report does not mention climate change climate risk or consider the related to its energy in contrast competitive like target and have the material and of climate change to their as an example target by setting greenhouse gas reduction goal through the science based initiative carbon risk generally financial performance according to research from when track manage and reduce carbon various financial tend to improve return on equity lower earnings volatility reduced and reduced regulatory risk the same report business of carbon reduction through renewable power adoption power price certainty responsiveness to customer demand for low carbon reduced overhead and reduced regulatory uncertainty from climate change likely to impact and or future fossil fuel energy it comes as no surprise that major whole coca cola nestle and have made toward renewable energy the executive chairman of eric much of corporate is renewable energy not just to be sustainable but because it business sense helping diversify their power supply hedge against fuel and support innovation in an increasingly cost competitive way which large carbon significantly its on reducing climate and renewable energy adoption although historically made commendable energy efficiency toward meeting energy consumption reduction goal by off it nonetheless its on overall greenhouse gas emission and renewable energy uptake how were on track to fight climate how were on track to fight climate change mart corporate target media climate change change information request target corporation section corporate net phoenix annual

temperature increasing in the where are with regard to renewable energy further behind its for instance made commitment to source of its power from joining over other whole market coca cola and made no such commitment and as of spring only solar power at seven of its of and distribution and just two wind turbines this is especially minimal to target which by had solar on of its corporate procurement of renewable energy is quickly as the cost of renewable energy significantly nationally according to data the average cost of electricity from the grid was for commercial in up from in renewable energy in contrast are lower and on downward trajectory according to energy finance sustainable energy in the most competitive power purchase came in at just over for solar while wind executed in the wind belt an in while market to renewable energy procurement remain an issue for some large corporate who have both significant market power and in house procurement are well positioned to take advantage of the business that this low cost renewable energy according to the study turning point of major have set goal of reducing their greenhouse gas and have set specific goal for their procurement of renewable energy globally have the re initiative and to renewable energy to power their according to the business corporate deal tracker for over of renewable energy in

renewable energy by these include on site solar large scale wind and other in addition to many of the food that supply have also to renewable energy organic valley and are all re many other major have set more modest renewable energy and more still are in the process of setting by failing to conduct the study by to determine the feasibility of setting renewable energy target management is missing potentially major business opportunity this refusal also the company at risk of falling behind that are able to procure renewable energy at lower and the company to and business by climate change response to the board of statement of opposition while to be to our company not disclosed clear comprehensive forward looking strategy to address climate or increase renewable energy beyond commitment to reduce energy use by per year for the next two and increase fuel economy at equivalent to current federal do not sufficiently indicate how the company will mitigate the potential for being left behind who are setting renewable energy and taking responsibility for the critical greenhouse gas emission to limit global temperature increase to well below internationally goal intended to avoid the most catastrophic of climate change conclusion the report will provide an important first step in the value of greater renewable energy to reduce climate risk and add to the resiliency and competitiveness weak to reduce the total greenhouse gas and its absolute in failure to recognize the serious this to its reputation brand regulatory compliance supply chain success and ongoing competitiveness with more efficient environmentally conscious with supply that stretch across the globe are extremely vulnerable to the of climate change the company made little headway since the last
