substitute for our financial as in accordance with is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment on capital management is useful metric to and because it how effectively we are our assets although is relatively standard financial term numerous exist for calculating as result the method used by our management to calculate may differ from other use to calculate their we urge

implementation of this amendment in the reclassification of current deferred tax as non current and had no effect on our consolidated of recently accounting in march the compensation retirement topic which that the service cost component of pension and benefit be in the same line item as other current employee compensation and other of those benefit be separately from the service cost component and outside subtotal of income from if the also that only the service cost component of pension and benefit cost is eligible for capitalization the update is effective for annual beginning after and interim within that annual period application is retrospective for the presentation of the of these benefit and prospective for the capitalization of only service we do not expect application of this to have material impact on our consolidated financial in may the revenue from with as by several subsequent which guidance for revenue recognition the principle is that revenue must be when goods and are transferred to the customer in an amount that is proportionate to what been at that point and that the consideration to which the company to be for those goods or per deferral of effective date this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending we formed project team to assess and document our accounting related to the revenue guidance as of the end of the

consolidated balance or consolidated of cash we intend to adopt the standard on retrospective basis and will be regarding revenue recognition as by the standard at adoption as we complete our assessment we are also and to implement to our accounting and business and to support the revenue recognition and disclosure in the which guidance for the recognition of lease the core principle is that company will now recognize most on its balance sheet as lease with corresponding right of use assets this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year ending early adoption is permitted the adoption of this will result in significant increase to our consolidated balance for lease and right of use assets and we are currently the other effects of adoption of this
