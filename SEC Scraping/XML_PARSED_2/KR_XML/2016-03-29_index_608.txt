assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could differ from those we believe that the following accounting are the most critical in the preparation of our financial because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex about the effect of that are inherently uncertain self insurance we primarily are self insured for related to compensation and general liability the represent our best estimate generally accepted actuarial of the ultimate for plus those but not for all through we establish case for case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both compensation and general liability we have stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on per claim basis we are insured for covered in excess of these per claim we account for the for compensation on present value basis risk discount rate basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability are not the underlying the ultimate of claim are subject to high degree of which can affect the liability for such for example variability in inflation of health care inherent in these can affect the similarly in

future claim and currently of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain have these include current period combined with history of or projection of or significant decrease in the market value of an asset when event we perform an impairment calculation undiscounted cash current cash flow information and growth related to specific to the carrying value for those if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market or future cash we record impairment when the carrying value fair market value with respect to property and equipment for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable based on our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value reduced by direct of disposal we asset in the normal course of business million in million in and million in we record to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated of as operating general and administrative expense the that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our of future cash our cash flow look several into the future and include on such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative and such as long lived assets for impairment at different level could produce significantly different goodwill our goodwill billion as of we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of we perform of each of our operating and variable interest collectively that have goodwill fair value is determined multiple of earnings or future cash and we compare fair value to the carrying value of unit for of potential impairment we base future cash on knowledge of the current operating environment and for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and excluding goodwill to estimate an fair value of the goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value in goodwill million primarily due to our merger with in goodwill million primarily due to our merger with for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for and refer to note to the consolidated financial the annual evaluation of goodwill for our other during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment based on current and future cash we believe goodwill are not reasonably likely reduction in fair value of our would not indicate potential for impairment of our goodwill balance for additional information to our of the goodwill impairment during and see note to the consolidated financial the impairment review the extensive use of management judgment and financial application of alternative and such as goodwill for impairment at different level could produce significantly different the cash flow in our goodwill impairment can be affected by several such as inflation business in the market the economy and market competition store we provide for closed store on the basis of the present value of the non lease after the date net of subtenant income we estimate the net lease discount rate to calculate the present value of the net rent on closed we usually pay closed store lease over the lease associated with the closed which generally have ranging from one to to closed store primarily relate to in subtenant income and actual exit from original we make for in in the period in which the change becomes known we review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to reduce the carrying of property equipment and leasehold in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we inventory write in connection with store if any in merchandise we expense to transfer inventory and equipment from closed as they are post retirement benefit we account for our defined benefit pension the recognition and disclosure of which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement on the consolidated balance sheet we record as component of other comprehensive income actuarial gains or prior service or and transition that have not yet been the determination of our obligation and expense for company pension and other post retirement is dependent upon our selection of used by in calculating those those are in note to the consolidated financial and include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of in compensation and health care actual that differ from our are and over future and therefore generally affect our expense and obligation in future while we believe that our are appropriate significant in our actual experience or significant in our the discount rate used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount was to match the cash to that of hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from and match the benefit cash the discount are the single that produce the same present value of cash the selection of the and discount as of year end for pension and other respectively the hypothetical bond portfolio with an aa or better rating with the assistance of an outside consultant we discount rate of and as of year end for pension and other respectively basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately million to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets by for we considered current and plan asset as well as historical and of return on various

for made in manner consistent with our target we believe rate of return assumption is reasonable for see note to the consolidated financial for more information on the asset of pension plan assets on we adopted mortality tables industry based tables for reflecting more current mortality experience and for future generational mortality improvement in calculating our benefit as of and and our

the consolidated pension plan in we recognize expense in connection with these as are funded or when are made in accordance with we made cash to these of million in million in and million in based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially in most of the employer to which we contribute substantially the value of the assets in trust to pay we have to estimate the amount by which these exceed the assets the amount of as of because we are only one of number of to these we also have to estimate the ratio of our to the total of all to these in year as way of our share of the nonetheless the is not direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of we estimate that our share of the of employer to which we contribute was approximately billion tax or billion after tax which share of of its employer this an increase in the amount of of approximately billion tax or approximately million after tax as of to the increase in the amount of is attributable to lower than on the assets in the employer during in mortality rate and the merger of our estimate is based on the most current information available to us actuarial and other data that include the of and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this is direct liability of ours rather we believe the is likely to have important in we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension subject to collective and capital market we expect in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few finally that in the event we were to exit certain or otherwise cease making to these funds we could trigger substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be when it is probable that liability and can be reasonably in accordance with the amount of above is an estimate and could change based on contract on the assets in the employer and benefit the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the of the assets in the trust significantly increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset decline if currently to these funds cease participation or if occur through collective trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of ours any to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made see note to the consolidated financial for more information to our

regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially the guidance below our for we expect net earnings to be to per diluted share which is essentially in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by actual fuel which we expect to be at or slightly below the five year average with continued volatility we expect our core business in to grow in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in reflecting the lower inflationary environment we expect full year fifo operating in excluding fuel to expand slightly to we expect capital excluding and of to be to billion these capital include approximately major covering and ruler to major and other minor and technology and infrastructure to support our customer st business strategy we expect total supermarket square footage for to grow approximately before and operational we expect year end to increase slightly to the result we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the resolution of certain tax in we anticipate product cost inflation of to excluding fuel and an lifo charge of approximately million we expect inflation to be lower during the portion of and to gradually rise during the later portion of we expect company pension expense to be approximately million we do not expect to make cash contribution in in we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under funded employer pension although these are not direct obligation or liability of any that would commit us to fund certain employer will be when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate with for store in little rock southern and in this year will be as we must have competitive cost in each market while meeting our needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement various and other could cause actual to differ materially from those in the forward looking these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial our ability to achieve earnings and cash flow may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending volatility of fuel in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock our ability to retain pharmacy from third party consolidation in the industry pharmacy benefit our ability to negotiate to employer pension natural or adverse weather the potential and associated with potential or data security the success of our future growth and the successful integration of teeter and our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by year end in product our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by in product at year end if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since fuel lower profit than our supermarket we expect to see our
