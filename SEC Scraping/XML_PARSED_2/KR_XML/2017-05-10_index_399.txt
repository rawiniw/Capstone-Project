effective messrs and in annual cash bonus plan metrics and connection to our business plan the annual cash bonus plan had the following measurable performance metrics all of which are and individually necessary to sustain our business model and achieve our growth strategy metric weight rationale for use id id represent without fuel at our that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our across the enterprise key driver of our model is strong id it is the engine that our growth net operating profit without supermarket fuel operating profit net operating profit this metric from to net operating profit the difference being depreciation because we are significant capital into assets we this metric to focus on an earnings result that the amortization of that investment net operating profit is an important way for us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we can not achieve solid net operating profit without strong operating model this is the best measure of the profitability of the business taking into account the capital to generate the earnings unlike earnings per share which can be affected by management on share this measure of earnings is relevant for all of our approximately who are eligible for the annual cash bonus plan customer st strategy customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four of our customer st strategy are people shopping experience and price this proprietary metric mixture of strategic and operational metrics that measure the improvement in how is by in each of the four annual cash bonus is based on certain of the customer st strategy to highlight annual that are intended to receive the most attention in that year total operating as percentage of without fuel an essential part of model is to increase productivity and to take out of the business in sustainable way we strive to be so that as the company are properly total of metrics bonus kicker an additional is if certain with respect to our expansion and the change from last kicker based on fuel our focus on different aspect of the business this year the bonus was added to the annual cash bonus plan as an incentive to encourage the addition of at faster rate while certain operating and financial the bonus of is only available if the determined are met if any of the are not met no portion of the bonus is net operating profit is calculated as gross profit minus operating general and administrative minus depreciation and amortization excluding supermarket fuel and the non portion of earnings of consolidated variable interest total operating is calculated as the sum of operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization and rent expense without supermarket fuel and warehouse and transportation shrink and advertising for our supermarket without fuel the use of these four primary metrics and on the various and that impact the long term success of the company the id net operating profit and customer st strategy metrics are weighted equally to highlight the need to simultaneously achieve all three metrics in order to maintain our growth we the weighting of id and net operating profit metrics to emphasize growth balanced with the focus on profit business is not sustainable if we merely increase our id but do not have corresponding increase in earnings furthermore in the id and net operating profit metrics are interrelated certain minimum payoff level on id must be for the net operating profit metric to exceed similarly certain minimum payoff level on net operating profit must be for the payoff on the id metric to exceed in addition certain minimum payoff level on both the id metric and net operating profit metric must be for the payoff of the customer st strategy metric to exceed by supporting the customer st strategy and the four we will better connect with our our unique competitive advantage is our ability to deliver on the four which are the that matter most to our as we strive to achieve our aggressive growth we also continuously aim to reduce our total operating as percentage of without fuel productivity and other in operating allow us to reduce in that do not matter to our so that we can invest money in the that matter the most to our like the four we carefully manage operating cost to ensure consistent delivery of the customer experience this again the need to have multiple metrics to create and on the various behavior and that are by the design of the bonus plan of annual cash bonus plan the established by the compensation committee the actual and the bonus percentage for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as target performance metrics minimum target weight id net operating profit billion billion billion customer st strategy total operating as percentage of without fuel bonus or total the customer st strategy goal also was established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive total operating without fuel were at as percentage of for fiscal year an additional would have been if had certain with respect to its expansion and operation these were established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but are not disclosed as they are competitively sensitive following the close of the year the compensation committee performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which those the compensation committee determined that in did not meet some of our business due to our performance when to the established by the compensation committee the of their bonus in as in all the compensation committee discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus for all executive the if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus were not appropriate given their assessment of company no were made in that affected neo the independent that discretion for the bonus the compensation committee and the independent also discretion to adjust the for each metric under the plan should unanticipated arise during the year the compensation committee and the independent in the case of the determined that the annual cash bonus appropriately reflected the performance in and therefore should not be the actual annual cash bonus percentage for performance that did not meet all of our business plan the strong link between pay and performance is by comparison of under our annual cash bonus plan in previous such as and when significantly in those we and or all of our business plan comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage in prior the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance fiscal year annual cash bonus percentage as above the annual cash bonus percentage is applied to each bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent in the case of the the actual of performance based annual cash to the for are in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee in the importance of providing an incentive to the to achieve the long term established by the board as such majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the long term and is via four long term compensation long term cash bonus performance stock and restricted stock long term compensation long term value creation and the over emphasis of short term at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee several in the target value of long term compensation to the or in the case of the to the independent the amount these include the compensation report regarding long term compensation by our peer group the level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation within individual performance and the recommendation of the for all other than the long term are structured to be combination of performance and time based compensation that of financial and common performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial and to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the long term strategic stock and restricted stock are linked to common performance alignment between and company have no initial value and only realize if the value of our common following the date of grant majority of long term compensation is equity based performance stock and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common further the of our with our all four of long term compensation are intended to focus executive on our long term strategy each component is in more detail below of long term compensation and outstanding for the are set forth in the executive compensation tables section long term incentive plan design in contrast to the performance based annual cash bonus plan above which approximately our performance based long term incentive plan approximately the each year we adopt similar long term incentive plan which for three year performance the long term incentive plan which of performance based long term cash bonus and performance the following the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition fixed number of performance is to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the are out in common based on actual performance along with cash amount equal to the during the performance period on the number of common ultimately the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance are each determined based on our performance against the same metrics established by the compensation committee the independent for the at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance actual can not exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance the compensation committee long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year each year when the performance metric and percentage per unit of improvement the compensation committee the difficulty of improvement over time under the long term incentive plan performance to approximately the long term incentive plan metrics and connection to our business strategy metric rationale for use customer st strategy customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four of our customer are people shopping experience and price this proprietary metric the improvement in how is by in each of the four long term incentive plan is based on all of the of the customer st strategy to maintain our consistent focus on the entirety of the customer st strategy this is in contrast to the annual cash bonus which is based on certain of the customer st strategy to highlight annual that are intended to receive the most attention in that year improvement in associate engagement in an annual survey of this metric is included in the long term incentive plan as an that our success is directly tied to our with and serving our every day whether in our distribution or reduction in as percentage without fuel an essential part of model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take out of the business in sustainable way we strive to be so that as the company are properly an operating metric is included in both the annual cash bonus plan and long term incentive operating without fuel can be temporarily on an annual basis but it is more difficult to maintain these over time it is the role of the approximately in the long term incentive plan to continue to reduce operating as percentage of without fuel over time and to ensure such are sustainable over the long term this metric in the long term incentive plan these key to implement for sustainable improvement over long period of time part of our long term growth strategy is to make substantial capital over time we have pipeline of high quality and store and we continue to increase the square footage in our fill in with significant capital spend it is essential that we achieve the proper on our this measure is intended to hold accountable for the on the capital operating is non measure and is calculated as the sum of operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and warehouse and transportation shrink and advertising for our supermarket without fuel operating will exclude one time in lieu of future future that are by virtue of the incurrence of

carbon footprint is to expand its use of renewable energy while making some on energy and supply chain efficiency not to reduce the carbon impact of its failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy is in strong contrast to its which are rapidly and profitably scaling renewable energy competitor me of solar at different target of solar at and solar business further to renewable electricity joining other major such as whole market and re target an ambitious goal to install distributed solar power on more and distribution by target corporate social responsibility report according to eric

our business that reduce carbon we assert that the of the proponent are by number of included in our history of reducing carbon across our footprint nearly ago we set goal which we to aggressively reduce energy consumption and refrigerant improve transportation efficiency and create renewable energy from food waste these targeted among have in nearly intensity reduction since even as our company grown in and square footage we are actively working to do more in both the short and long term for example our turkey hill dairy two wind energy turbines with megawatt capacity since these turbines have up to of the annual electricity needs which is enough power to produce six million of ice cream and million of iced tea in addition ten have approximately of solar energy capacity that annually approximately million the recovery system in ca at the food less distribution been in operation since late it anaerobic digestion naturally process to transform food waste into renewable this system annually approximately of food waste annually this is then turned into power for the system approximately million of renewable energy for the square foot food less distribution the system area truck by more than each year and waste these are to reduce carbon by per year early last year set of several specific to address carbon emission reduction across the enterprise will reduce cumulative energy consumption by by as year will build on our long term success of energy consumption reduction through the maintenance of and as well as testing and learning from will improve transportation efficiency by by as year we will track our ton per gallon effectively looking at how many we haul one ton of on one gallon of fuel will reduce refrigerant in our supermarket refrigeration will reduce refrigerant by to the program year will be zero waste company by as defined by or more of waste away from as food manufacturer and retailer the reduction of food waste is key component to meet this goal its also key component of our scope we have many in place to divert as much food as possible away from to higher better for each of the past several we have our annual report that many of our can also be found at finally as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental we are in the midst of an analysis to develop comprehensive carbon reduction plan that we cross functional team to help

soy beef and pulp paper the percentage that can be back to its source and the percentage via credible third as not to physical expansion into or these against an for consistent with those criteria and an assessment of and operational facing in relation to supply chain and operational on deforestation the board of vote against this proposal for the following the regarding deforestation associated with palm oil beef soy and paper pulp used to produce corporate in many industry and credible third such as the world wildlife fund the consumer goods forum alliance and the consortium to address the
