to report accurately and fairly our operating and financial position and we apply those accounting in consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting are in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended the preparation of financial in conformity with generally accepted accounting us to make and that affect the of assets and and related of contingent assets and we base our on historical experience and other we believe to be reasonable under the the of which form the basis for making about the carrying of assets and that are not readily apparent from other actual could vary from those recently adopted accounting in june the financial accounting board its the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial and to increase the prominence of in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment that all non owner in equity be either in single continuous statement of

effective for the interim and annual beginning on or after early adoption was result in common definition of fair value and common for fair value measurement and disclosure between general accepted accounting and international financial accounting consequently the change some fair value measurement and disclosure the implementation of the accounting guidance did not have material effect on our consolidated financial position or of outlook this discussion and analysis certain forward looking about future performance these are based on and in light of the information currently available such relate to among other in net earnings attributable to the identical supermarket growth product cost pension plan our ability to generate operating cash capital square footage growth to reduce cash flow and our operating plan for the future and are by such as comfortable will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar or these forward looking are subject to and other that could cause actual to differ materially elsewhere in this report and below regarding our or are forward looking within the meaning of section of the exchange act of while we believe that the are accurate about the general economy our labor our ability to execute our on timely basis and other below could cause actual to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share excluding the in the range of for this net earnings per diluted share range of to for the fourth quarter of the annual guidance range the strength of our for the first three quarters of these guidance assume the benefit of the in lower lifo charge the benefit of share and the benefit from the pension plan consolidation the benefit of the in will be disclosed when we release our annual earnings in march the benefit of the is dependent on many and outstanding we expect the net earnings benefit from the in the fourth quarter of per diluted share will be in the range of this to net earnings per diluted share growth rate in the range of excluding the in the in the overview section of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of and the consolidated pension plan charge in the of we expect identical supermarket growth excluding fuel of in the fourth quarter of this guidance the effect of several brand prescription that have come off patent during which will reduce because generic have lower retail price than branded our long term business model will be structured to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth plus higher dividend over time for we intend to continue to focus on improving growth in accordance with our customer by making in gross and customer shopping we expect to finance these primarily with operating cost we expect fifo non fuel operating excluding the for to expand slightly to excluding the consolidated pension plan charge in for we expect our lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on cost for in our inventory for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital to maintain our current debt coverage to pay cash and to repurchase stock as market change we may re evaluate these of cash flow we expect to obtain growth from square footage as well as from productivity from capital reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as on productivity from our store base through in addition we intend to continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate and logistics and technology our continued capital spending on technology is on improving store logistics procurement category management and and is to reduce we intend to continue cash flow from to finance capital expenditure we expect capital for to be in the range of billion excluding and of we expect capital for to be approximately billion excluding and of we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before and operational based on current operating we believe that cash flow from and other of liquidity under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet for working capital capital interest and principal for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage under our debt to continue to respond effectively to competitive we believe we have adequate of cash if under our credit facility and other borrowing for the next twelve and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve we expect that our will be affected by such as higher employee benefit and credit card offset by productivity from process and leverage through we expect that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of will be approximately excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax we expect rent expense as percentage of total and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be to reduce our operating in such as administration productivity shrink and transportation we intend to invest most of these in our core business to drive profitable growth and offer value and shopping for our we expect to contribute approximately million in total to the company defined benefit pension in for the first three quarters of we approximately million to these we expect any made during will decrease our in future among other investment performance of plan assets the interest to be used to calculate the pension and future in legislation will determine the of any additional we expect expense for company defined benefit pension to be approximately million in addition we expect retirement account plan cash and expense from automatic and matching to to increase slightly in to we expect to contribute approximately million to employer pension in subject to collective in addition we expect meaningful in expense as result of in employer pension plan over the next few we do not anticipate additional goodwill in we expect to refinance billion of debt maturing in calendar and we have various labor that will be in covering store in and we will also negotiate an agreement for our in our distribution facility in upon the expiration of our collective work the affected could occur if we are unable to negotiate with labor work substantial number of could have material adverse effect on our in all of these rising health care and pension will continue to be an important issue in various and other could cause us to fail to achieve our these include the extent to which our of liquidity are sufficient to meet our may be affected by the state of the financial and the effect that such condition on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable our ability to borrow under our of credit our bank credit could be if one or more of our under those is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural or weather interfere with the ability of our to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial in market could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve and earnings may be affected by labor or in the and of that compete with us and promotional of and non traditional and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these the state of the economy interest the inflationary and deflationary in certain and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel have on consumer spending in government funded benefit commodity diesel fuel related to our logistics in consumer spending the extent to which our exercise caution in their in response to economic the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery in inflation or deflation in product and operating stock the effect of brand prescription going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy from third party such as express the that we receive from the consolidation of the pension and the success of our future growth the extent to which the we are making to our strategy create value for our will depend primarily on the reaction of our and our to these as well as operating inflation or deflation competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our our ability to achieve and earnings may also be affected by our ability to manage the above our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic weather availability of raw and in the that we sell and their and other beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost will depend on the of our and to those our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our could be affected by unanticipated in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the and our failure to generate earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by in product during the year if actual differ significantly from future for certain variable interest an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the fair value would have to be in addition to the above our identical supermarket growth could be affected by in private label the effect of our sister in close proximity to an store and in retail our operating without fuel could decline or fail to meet if we are unable to pass on any cost if we fail to deliver the cost or if in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those differ from our we have our exposure to the and litigation in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing and believe we have made where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected in these however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings in the and of that compete with us are likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable can not be rent expense which subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which the amortization of assets under capital is principally the straight line method over the useful of individual assets or the of use of the straight line method of depreciation risk that future asset write or potential impairment related to store would be than if an accelerated method of depreciation were our effective tax rate may differ from the rate due to in the status of pending with various taxing and the of certain the actual amount of automatic and matching cash to our retirement account plan will depend on the number of compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of the of our and expense related to employer pension funds could vary from the that we expect and could increase more than should asset in these funds deteriorate if withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our prove to be our could increase more rapidly than we have if the investment performance of our pension plan assets does not meet due to poor performance of the financial or for other our to company defined benefit pension could increase more than in future in or in accounting taxation and environmental may have material effect on our financial in the general business and economic in our operating may affect the shopping of our which could affect and earnings in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial for example we continue to add supermarket fuel to our store base since gasoline low profit we expect to see our fifo gross profit decline as gasoline increase although this negatively our fifo gross gasoline provide positive effect on expense as percentage of our capital square footage growth and number of store over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in suitable for if development vary from those if our logistics and technology or store are not on budget or within the time frame or if economic fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment in our credit in the amount of outstanding debt to incur prepayment on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely our and in an increase in debt impairment goodwill could be affected by in our of future cash market or business in the market our cash flow include several of cash which would be affected by in the economic environment real estate market competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our expense and obligation for pension and other post retirement could be affected by in the used in calculating those these include among the discount rate the long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of in compensation and health care adverse weather could increase the cost our charge for their or may decrease customer demand for certain in demand for certain could also increase the cost our charge for their additionally in the cost of such as utility or raw material could negatively affect financial and earnings although we presently operate only in the united civil unrest in foreign in which our do business may affect the we are for goods if we are unable to pass on these to our our fifo gross and net earnings would suffer earnings and also may be affected by natural or adverse weather particularly to the extent that they disrupt our or those of our create in the availability or in the cost of that we sell in our or and we use in our or raise the cost of energy to our various the cost of transportation we can not fully foresee the effects of in economic on business we have assumed economic and competitive will not change significantly for
