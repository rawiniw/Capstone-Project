human used to frame the assessment frequency of assessment methodology used to track and measure performance nature and extent of consultation with relevant in connection with the assessment how the of the assessment are incorporated into company and decision making the report should be made available to on no later than supporting statement as long term we favor and that protect and enhance the value of our there is increasing recognition that company related to human such as litigation damage and project and can adversely affect shareholder value like many other adopted supplier code of conduct see the company standard vendor agreement but yet to publish company wide human policy human and separate human code that to its adoption of these would be an important first step in effectively human must then assess to shareholder value of human in their and supply to translate into protective the importance of human risk assessment is reflected in the united on business and human the by the un human council in the urge that business should carry out human due actual and potential human and acting upon the and communicating how are business media mar business it to

not be permitted to do business with us until they comply with our code as such we do not believe that human in our supply chain pose substantial risk that the report would serve little benefit to and preparation of report would divert that otherwise could be more appropriately used in the best of this proposal the same subject matter as one to vote at the last three annual and was soundly by shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by two the name and of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to secretary at executive that it to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas post consumer and printed paper nearly half of waste and is significant consumer of natural energy and source of greenhouse gas half of printed paper and is or burned rather than plastic debris to where it damages tourism and marine life there is growing link between ineffective waste management and plastic debris piling up in and where it and marine invasive species and threat to human health nearly million annually to prevent trash much of it from polluting and ocean frontage the market value of wasted that could be is billion more efficient use of valuable it less pollution and less energy than virgin raw in the pay to recycle but poor infrastructure and strapped municipal have lagging for aluminum for glass and only for plastic further house among other are recently increasing use of non flexible plastic such as more than have some or all of onto of intensive can expect to be to take more responsibility for of in the future we believe some measure of responsibility for is key component of corporate environmental policy extended producer responsibility corporate and public policy that accountability for of from to is promising potential solution two major coca cola and nestle na have for to adopt in the legislation is pending in several taking an active role in for producer responsibility for will reduce risk ensure continued high quality reduce wasted and increase program the company not decisively to lead or participate in such an effort nor its responsibility for post consumer for its be it resolved that of request that the board of issue report at reasonable cost and confidential information policy position on the responsibility for post consumer product of its private label and whether alternative could lead to substantially supporting statement in the report should include analyses of company based that will increase of and participation in policy and technical development of or other producer responsibility in collaboration with sector and with goal of greatly and reduced energy use and pollution the board of vote against this proposal for the following the regarding waste reduction and the important role it as good steward of the environment we have numerous in place to preserve our natural and to conserve energy for instance the company more than million of plastic waste from and plastic film in the company also more than billion of cardboard each year most importantly weve the perishable partnership which the donation of more than million of safe wholesome food to feeding food to fight hunger in local that which can not be donated is or converted to energy through an innovative waste to energy system by scaling up these innovative is reducing the amount of waste being sent to also works to reduce waste in the first place by designing and is in national to expand and scale infrastructure for each of the past several we have on line the public report and our annual report that highlight the and waste reduction in greater detail this proposal that take additional to report on the feasibility of policy of extended producer responsibility or the resolution no guidance regarding view of the of company adopted policy to reduce waste in the supply chain as above and in our various it would be inappropriate however to support policy that is not clearly defined we believe our support for waste reduction in our supply chain are significant and meaningful is familiar with various in and in other that require and to pay substantial and related to waste disposal the vary in detail and implementation and while we do assess and for their feasibility cost and to do so for each individual proposal at the federal state and international level would require significant that could be more wisely in the best of often is to take position on legislation or regulatory while occasionally we will communicate to federal state and local our on specific policy we believe it is premature to offer an official position statement on legislative and regulatory without first carefully examining the of each individual law or regulation and how it would affect our and our business this proposal the same subject matter as one to vote at the last two annual and was soundly by shareholder annual meeting shareholder intended for inclusion in our

review store quarterly to ensure that any amount that is not sufficient estimate of future or that no longer is for its originally intended purpose is to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash and asset recovery based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is our previous to dispose of similar assets and current economic the ultimate cost of the disposition of the and the related assets is affected by current real estate inflation and general economic we reduce for disposal to their net realizable value we account for to

used and the return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement and our future expense note to the consolidated financial the effect of change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit and the related liability the objective of our discount rate was intended to reflect the at which the pension could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of that would be available under the our methodology for the discount as of year end and was to match the cash to that of hypothetical

basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension benefit obligation as of by approximately to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets by for we considered current and plan asset as well as historical and of return on various asset due to the teeter merger close to year end the rate of return on pension plan assets acquired in the teeter merger did not affect our

increase or if further occur through collective trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand share of the could increase and future expense could be adversely affected if the asset decline if currently to these funds cease participation or if occur through collective trustee action or adverse legislation the company to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded employer

favorable based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue of common under the share repurchase we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt during but do not currently expect

borrow on daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper program at we had billion of outstanding are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit fall the ability to borrow under our current program could be adversely affected for period of time and increase our interest cost on daily under our program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our program would be any lower than million on daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march we had million of outstanding the decrease as of march to year end was due to cash from against our year end
