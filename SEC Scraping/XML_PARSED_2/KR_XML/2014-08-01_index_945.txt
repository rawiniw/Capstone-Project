price topping bidder would have to pay but topping bidder would be sufficiently from even bidding in the first place the merger agreement from soliciting topping thus topping bidder would have to emerge on its own if topping bidder were to emerge and make play for can not even respond to the topping bidder for at least after providing notice to when does respond the merger agreement to provide with the name of the bidder and the information underlying the topping proposal and to provide the same information provided to the topping bidder to contemporaneously given the highly competitive nature of the industry these rapid information serve to dissuade topping bidder as it will have to reveal business and to without any recourse or risk to the merger agreement then with matching period that can use to draw out bidding process this potential topping because of inter the cost of the time the topping bidder will spend during the matching process which process the topping bidder no guarantee of winning to compound the problem the merger agreement further grip on if topping bidder its bid public in that scenario the merger agreement board to publicly reconfirm its support of the by within five business days after demand by that board do so thus not only does topping bidder have to anticipate drawn out matching process can force board to reconfirm support of potentially even before the matching process is finished as result are locked into the per share tender offer without the ability to benefit from an unencumbered bidding process through which or another entity like

that that may purchase at price per share equal to the merger consideration that number of necessary to obtain over of the outstanding of the company thus to complete short form merger in the event that the transaction can not be under section even more troubling is the fact that can purchase those by paying in cash an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the up option and by and to the company promissory note principal amount equal to the remainder of such purchase price to the detriment of the the of the merger agreement substantially favor and are calculated to unreasonably dissuade potential from making for example the individual have all but that another entity will not emerge with proposal by agreeing to no solicitation provision in section of the merger agreement

furnish non public information to such person and shall include with such notice of any written received from or on behalf of such person to such acquisition proposal without limiting the foregoing it is understood that any violation of the foregoing by the or shall be to be breach of this section by the company further locking up control of the company in favor of is section of the merger agreement which provision for termination fee of million payable by the company to if the individual cause the company to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the lawful exercise of their fiduciary additionally the company into the support with certain board and their specifically the company into support with individual defendant and capital which is large company stockholder and is by further the company into support with the great hill group which are by individual and collectively capital and the great hill group own of the stock the company by of the stock is already locked up in favor of the transaction as herein the solicitation statement that the company into confidentiality with eleven that expressed an interest in the company but it does not disclose whether those confidentiality standstill or however given the fact that the confidentiality agreement into with on march standstill and provision from among other to acquire the company or waiver or modification of any provision of the standstill for period of two it is likely that the confidentiality into with the other eleven interested contain similarly restrictive thus the board used these preclusive to handcuff the eleven interested from the very outset rather than them to extract best and final from few select at the end of the process as they should be used even more problematic is the fact that the board agreed to section of the merger agreement which that the company shall not terminate amend or waive any standstill or other similar agreement into with any other party other than thus the eleven that expressed interest in the company are contractually from for waiver of their standstill agreement and the board is contractually from those moreover under section of the merger agreement the board may not solicit from or previously thus the board contractually itself from the highest price reasonably available for the as it was to do or at the very least itself from becoming informed about the value in the market place as if that was not enough the board into the day exclusivity agreement with on may thereby the board from speaking with other interested party which an offer to acquire the company this was also problematic considering that the company engaged in wholly inadequate market check prior to entering into the exclusivity agreement which in the company no financial and produced only one other initial bid from party by agreeing to all of the deal protection the likely the support and the exclusivity agreement with the individual have locked up the transaction and have other from making successful for the company furthermore the merger consideration to be to plaintiff and the class in the transaction is unfair and inadequate because among other the intrinsic value of the company is materially in excess of the amount in the transaction accordingly the transaction will deny class their right to share proportionately and equitably in the value of the valuable and profitable business and future growth in and earnings as above the company been well recently moreover the stock price as high as per share in the last or over higher than the merger consideration further have set mean target price for the company of per share and one analyst set price target of per share furthermore the merger consideration to adequately compensate the for the significant by the merger according to rodney we are delighted to welcome to the talented team built an exceptional retail destination in the growing nutrition and wellness market with an enviable

create exciting of personalization and convenience for our as result the have their fiduciary that they owe to the public because the will not receive adequate or fair value for their common stock in the transaction the materially incomplete and misleading solicitation statement the solicitation statement with the sec in connection with the transaction as below and elsewhere herein the solicitation statement material information that must be disclosed to to enable them to render an informed decision with respect to the transaction the solicitation statement material information with respect to the process and leading up to the transaction as well as the and analyses of financial advisor this information if disclosed would significantly alter the total mix of information available to for example the solicitation statement to disclose whether the confidentiality into with the eleven that expressed an interest in the company standstill or and if so the solicitation statement must explain the significance of those as the confidentiality agreement into with standstill and from among other to acquire the company or waiver or modification of any provision of the standstill for period of two moreover section of the merger agreement that the company shall not terminate amend or waive any standstill or other similar agreement thus it is likely that the confidentiality into
