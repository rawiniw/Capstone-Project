operating in fiscal were associate incentive continued investment in our global and related to third party the foreign corrupt act also operating for fiscal in fiscal our global to the majority of the increase in operating as we continued to invest in our commerce depreciation expense also due to our financial system with the remainder of the increase being driven by multiple none of which were individually significant operating income and in fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year although we operating in fiscal and operating income for both grew at rate than in fiscal the primary for operating income growing than were the in our global and related to third party the additionally our investment in price for sold in our retail which gross to operating income growing than in fiscal and was the primary cause for operating income growing than in fiscal table of on return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for fiscal and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the impact of and currency exchange rate we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as fiscal ended in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and exclude assets of of million million respectively which are in and other in the company consolidated balance as of and exclude of of million million respectively which are included in in the company consolidated balance table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of billion fiscal and respectively the billion increase in free cash flow for fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to higher income from positively net cash from operating and lower capital the modest decline in free cash flow in fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to capital the growth in net cash from operating free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our

square which square added through net from in fiscal for billion of the increase in net and in currency exchange positively impacted net by billion our gross profit as percentage of gross profit rate declined and basis in fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the decline in gross profit rate during fiscal is primarily due to the segment strategic focus on price investment and low price leadership during fiscal all three decline in gross profit rate due to in price generally our and international realize higher gross profit than our sam club segment which on lower as

positively impacted operating income million and million in fiscal and respectively our effective income tax rate was for fiscal with and for fiscal and respectively the fiscal effective income tax rate was lower than the previous fiscal year primarily due to number of discrete tax the positive impact from fiscal legislative at the end of the fiscal year most notably the taxpayer relief act of the fiscal effective income tax rate was largely consistent with that for fiscal the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax for fiscal and is in note in the to consolidated financial looking forward we expect the annual effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended fiscal to range between and as was the case with our effective income tax rate for fiscal our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period due to variety of in our assessment of certain tax valuation in tax of administrative the impact of other discrete and the mix of earnings among our

unit net percentage change in net from previous fiscal year calendar comparable store operating income operating income as percentage of net unit retail square net for the segment and for fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the increase in net for fiscal to fiscal was due to increase in comparable store as result of higher average ticket and an increase in customer traffic combined with increase in retail square the increase in net for fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of in retail square gross profit rate declined basis for fiscal when to the previous

impacted operating income million and million in fiscal and respectively international grew operating income faster than in fiscal but did not grow operating income faster than in fiscal table of club believe the information in the following table under the caption excluding fuel is useful to because it to understand the effect that fuel which are impacted by the volatility of fuel on the operating of the sam club segment volatility in fuel may continue to impact the operating of the sam club segment in the future fiscal ended in millions except unit percentage change from previous fiscal year

customer traffic and average ticket and higher fuel higher fuel resulting from higher fuel and sold positively impacted comparable by basis during fiscal gross profit rate was flat in fiscal when to fiscal and was not impacted by fuel in fiscal gross profit rate basis when to fiscal driven by the highly competitive retail environment as well as inflation and high fuel in fiscal fuel negatively impacted the comparison by basis operating as percentage of net and basis for fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the fiscal decrease was due to wage management benefit related to
