international segment now of the outside of the united and the club segment now the warehouse membership in the united and as well as all prior period have been to conform to the current presentation throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store or comparable club the company the of its among other each operating income that certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the under the caption other in the table below to operating income are corporate overhead comparable store is measure which the performance of our and by measuring the growth in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store from and open for the previous and in format are from comparable store when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square footage of more than five percent comparable store are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in of our consolidated and the operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to convert the international operating from local into for the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not in the dollar effective may the company enterprise resource system for its in the united canada and concurrent with this implementation and the system the company the level at which it the retail method of accounting for inventory in these from to the company the change is preferable because the retail method of accounting for inventory at the departmental level better merchandise with similar cost to retail and turnover as well as more accurate cost of goods sold and ending inventory value at the lower of cost or market for each period the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase our operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently the company our assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net three ended six ended dollar in millions net total net total net net total international club net our net and for the three and six ended respectively to the three and six ended the increase in net is primarily due to our continued expansion as we added of additional retail square footage as of to our retail square footage as of in addition million and billion of the increase in net was due to currency exchange rate for the three and six month ended respectively volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future comparable store club total club comparable club include fuel fuel had positive impact of percentage and negative impact of percentage for the three ended and respectively fuel had positive impact of percentage and negative impact of percentage for the six ended and respectively volatility in fuel may continue to impact the club comparable club in the future fuel had positive impact of percentage and negative impact of percentage for the three ended and respectively fuel had positive impact of percentage and negative impact of percentage for the six ended and respectively volatility in fuel may continue to impact the total comparable store in the future comparable store in the united fuel percent and percent for the three and six ended respectively the decline in comparable store in the current three and six month was primarily driven by the decline in customer traffic at certain deflation in certain merchandise and competitive activity leverage operating income three ended six ended dollar in millions total total total total international club other total operating income we believe growing operating income at faster rate than net growth is meaningful measure because it how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net operating for the three and six ended operating and respectively when to the same in the prior year while net and respectively over the same operating grew at rate than net primarily due to labor productivity and organizational at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our in addition operating for the three ended were positively impacted by decrease in certain incentive plan operating income for the three and six ended we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net our operating income grew by and for the three and six ended respectively when to the same in the prior year while net by and respectively over the same we met this objective in both primarily due to our focus on expense return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was and for the trailing month ended and respectively the period over period increase in roi is principally due to solid operating performance resulting from our focus on expense leverage we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure under the we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its roi before our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as dollar in millions as calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data as as total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively effective may the company enterprise resource system for its in the united canada and concurrent with this implementation and the system the company the level at which it the retail method of accounting for inventory for these from to the company the change is preferable because the retail method of accounting for inventory at the departmental level better merchandise with similar cost to retail and turnover as well as more accurate cost of goods sold and ending inventory value at the lower of cost or market for each period the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of billion and billion for the six ended and respectively our free cash flow during the period was positively impacted by temporary increase in payable as result of timing related to our payment partially offset by our investment in inventory free cash flow is considered non financial measure under the management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the six ended and as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in in those six in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in of the following discussion of our of is based on our and any or discussion of our consolidated three ended and percentage dollar in millions in our consolidated net for the three ended when to the three ended the increase in net is primarily due
