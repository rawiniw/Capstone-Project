in our free cash flow is primarily the result of operating and inventory management free cash flow is considered non financial measure under the management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow

rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure under the we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you
