year accordingly we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net for either period overall lower than net higher investment in key such as global leverage and commerce and additional related to the foreign corrupt act and and our global compliance program and organizational to us not for the three and nine for the and and our global compliance program and organizational were the three and nine respectively to million and million for the three and nine respectively the negative leverage impact of these was partially offset by lower incentive for the three and nine operating the three and nine operating income grew and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year in currency exchange negatively impacted operating income million for the three ended and positively impacted operating income million for the nine ended we grew operating income at faster rate than net for both primarily due to in the gross rate of basis and basis for the three and nine respectively and in our membership and other income of and for the three and nine respectively these in operating income were partially offset by the we for not operating table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve month ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to in and commerce growth in working capital and the impact of we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and in the table exclude assets of that are reflected in the company condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the nine to free cash flow of the nine the decline in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of for income and as well as higher capital when to the same period in the previous fiscal year free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in nine ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free

basis respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year overall lower than net higher investment in key such as global leverage and commerce and additional related to the and and our global

tax were and for the three and nine to our effective income tax of and for the same in the previous fiscal year respectively our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as result of in our assessment of certain tax valuation in tax law of administrative the impact of discrete and the mix of earnings among our and international where the statutory are generally lower

impacted our comparable store approximately for each of the three and nine month ended gross profit rate and basis for the three and nine respectively to the same in the previous fiscal year the in

also included in our computation of free cash flow cash from operating cash provided by operating was the nine and respectively the decline in net cash provided by operating was primarily due to the timing of for income and cash and working and cash were and respectively our working capital were and respectively the decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily attributable to the increase in our inventory as and sam club accelerated inventory to support our holiday as well as lower than across the company timing also to the decrease in our working capital deficit we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in and in providing to our in the form of share and of cash we employ our global in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through other ongoing cash from external or both accordingly we intend with only certain limited to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash outside of the in our foreign when the income either from or through our global and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our with respect
