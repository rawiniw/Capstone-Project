for fiscal were negatively impacted by as result of in currency exchange and in fuel from lower fuel at the sam club segment the negative effect of such was partially offset by year over year growth in retail square positive comparable in the segment and higher commerce across the company calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal and were as fiscal ended with sam club total table of store and club in the fuel and in fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the fiscal total comparable store and club were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher commerce at the segment partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel primarily due to lower fuel at the sam club segment commerce positively impacted comparable approximately and for and sam club respectively for fiscal the fiscal total comparable store and club were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher commerce at the segment offset to significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel from lower fuel at the sam club segment commerce positively impacted comparable approximately and for and sam club respectively for fiscal as we continue to add and in the we do so with an understanding that additional and may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club as result of opening and was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by the of the impacted and which are based on their proximity to the and to those of nearby non impacted and in each case as measured after the and are table of we are primarily on growth we also place priority on generating to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced we generate by efficiently assets and effectively working capital we monitor these through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics which we discuss below in addition we are on providing to our in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital section we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets return on assets and return on investment management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was and for the fiscal ended and respectively roi was and for the fiscal ended and respectively the in and roi were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and in accordance with for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi table of calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as fiscal ended in millions calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating of billion fiscal and respectively we free cash flow of billion fiscal and respectively the increase in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to working capital management additionally we from the application of tax related to the accelerated deduction of and related the decrease in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower income from partially offset by lower capital spending and working capital management definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net

of the retail value of inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued the lifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market which is determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent the retail method of accounting management to make certain and that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit made include recording used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management the ability to sell inventory for clearance activity and the related cost impact are considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer could cause material in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary we record lifo provision for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo we provide for inventory or shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of historical percentage of following annual inventory the provision is to reflect historical impairment of evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable management regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and operational performance such as operating income and cash the evaluation for long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level or in certain at the market group level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that of impairment exist and require impairment be which could result in management the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be generally this evaluation with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after an assessment based on the qualitative that the fair value of the unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that fair value of the unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be the quantitative test for impairment management to make to future cash growth and economic and market these are based on the fair value of unit or asset valuation method such as cash flow or relative market based approach historically our have sufficient to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the used in these if different occur in future future operating could be materially impacted table of have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income in the and numerous foreign accordingly the determination of our provision for income significant judgment the use of and the

affect our tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax will withstand challenge if any from taxing when and change we reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate we account for uncertain tax by the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is to meet before being in the financial this determination the use of significant judgment in our tax and the timing and of deductible and taxable deferred tax assets represent available to reduce income payable on taxable income in future such assets arise because of temporary between the financial and tax bases of assets and as well as from net operating loss and tax credit deferred tax assets are for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be many are considered when whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recent cumulative earnings of
