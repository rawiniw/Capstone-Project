prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the other in the leverage discussion of the company performance metrics include corporate overhead and other comparable store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as in format continue to be from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange that we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not in the dollar for financial we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior currency exchange we exclude the impact of current period from our calculation we refer to the of this calculation as currency translation throughout our discussion when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency translation and without the impact of current period the disclosure of constant currency or excluding the effect of to understand better our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or we made certain to prior fiscal year or to conform to the

year ended company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on through comparable store and club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net fiscal ended dollar in millions net net net international club net our consolidated net and in fiscal and respectively to the previous fiscal year the increase in net for fiscal was attributable to combination of an increase in comparable growth in retail square and currency translation while the increase in net for fiscal was attributable to growth in retail square and currency translation partially offset by decline in comparable store and club also to the increase in net for fiscal our continued expansion added and of additional retail square during fiscal and respectively currency translation for billion and billion of the increase in net for fiscal and respectively the of and in the second quarter of fiscal and further in note in the to consolidated financial for billion of the net increase in fiscal volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future calendar comparable store and club comparable store and club is measure which the performance of our and by measuring the growth in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club for fiscal and are as with fuel fuel impact club total comparable store and club in the fuel in fiscal and and in fiscal and respectively comparable store during fiscal primarily due to an increase in average ticket partially offset by decline in traffic comparable club were higher during fiscal due to member base driving traffic as well as assortment of total comparable store and club during fiscal primarily due to decline in customer traffic although customer traffic in fiscal comparable store and club in the were lower than those in the previous fiscal year due to deflation in certain merchandise and lower fuel as we continue to add and in the we do so with an understanding that additional and may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club as result of opening and was approximately in fiscal and and in fiscal leverage operating income fiscal ended dollar in millions international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at rate faster than net and that may grow our operating income at rate than net operating we operating in fiscal and in fiscal our operating to fiscal while net in fiscal to fiscal operating grew at rate than net due to our continued focus on expense management our global to the majority of the increase in operating as we continue to invest in our commerce depreciation expense year over year based on our financial system with the remainder of the increase being driven by multiple none of which were individually significant in fiscal our operating to fiscal while net during fiscal to fiscal operating grew at rate than net in fiscal due to labor productivity and organizational made at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our as well as reduction in certain incentive plan operating income as result of the above and our investment in price for sold in our retail which reduced our gross our operating income and in fiscal and respectively while net and in fiscal and respectively return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was and for fiscal and respectively the decrease in roi in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to additional in property plant and equipment global and higher as well as price investment ahead of full realization of productivity in future productivity gains are to more closely with price additionally to lesser degree roi was positively impacted by currency translation but offset by we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the consolidated balance of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we positive free cash flow of billion billion and billion for the fiscal ended and respectively the modest decline in free cash flow in fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to capital the growth in net cash from operating the decrease in free cash flow during fiscal was primarily due to an investment in inventory after fiscal ended with relatively low inventory partially offset by in payable free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow of the following discussion of our of is based on our and any or discussion of our consolidated of fiscal in millions except unit net percentage change from previous fiscal year total calendar comparable

operating income was billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively club segment we believe the information in the following table under the caption excluding fuel is useful to because it to understand the effect of the club fuel which are impacted by the volatility of fuel fiscal in millions except unit fuel net percentage change from previous fiscal year calendar comparable club operating income operating income as percentage of net unit retail square excluding fuel net percentage change from previous fiscal year calendar comparable club operating income operating income as

customer traffic in average ticket and higher fuel higher fuel resulting from higher fuel and sold positively impacted comparable by basis during fiscal the fiscal growth in net is primarily due to the increase in average ticket and member traffic in addition fuel driven by higher fuel and sold positively impacted comparable club by basis in fiscal volatility in fuel may continue to impact the net and operating income of the club segment in the future gross profit basis for fiscal to fiscal the gross profit decrease was driven by the highly competitive retail environment as well as

respectively the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of additional income from and the timing of for the decrease in cash flow from operating during fiscal was primarily due to an investment in inventory after fiscal ended with relatively low inventory partially offset by in payable cash and working capital cash and cash were billion and billion at and

in addition to the inherent in our we are exposed to certain market in interest and in currency exchange the analysis below for each of our market risk sensitive is based on hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market the effect of change in particular assumption is calculated without any other assumption in reality however change in one factor could cause change in another which may magnify or negate other interest rate risk we are exposed to in interest as result of our short term and long term debt we hedge portion of our interest

summary of critical accounting management to report our financial in clear and understandable manner although in some accounting and disclosure are complex and require us to use technical terminology in the consolidated financial we follow accounting generally accepted in the united these require us to make certain and apply that affect our financial position and of as reflected in our financial these and are based on past and of future actual may differ from our management continually our accounting how they are applied and how they are and disclosed in our financial following is summary of our critical accounting and how they are applied in preparation of the financial we value at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the merchandise the retail method of accounting in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent are currently taken as reduction of the retail value of inventory the club merchandise is valued based on the weighted average cost the lifo method for the international are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated the first in first out fifo method under the retail method inventory is stated at cost which is determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is based on the initial of beginning inventory plus the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any the retail method management to make certain and that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit made include recording used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management the salability of inventory for clearance activity and the related cost impact are considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer related to fashion could cause material in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary we record lifo provision for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo we provide for inventory shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of percentage of following annual inventory the provision is to reflect historical impairment of assets we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and operational performance such as operating income and cash the evaluation for long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level or in certain at the market group level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that impairment exist and require impairment be which could result in management the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be this evaluation with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if we determine based on the qualitative that the fair value of the unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount the quantitative goodwill impairment test would be this quantitative test for impairment management to make to future cash growth and economic and market these are based on the fair value of unit or asset valuation method such as cash flow or relative market based approach historically we have sufficient within the applicable to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the used in these if different occur in future future operating could be materially impacted income income have significant effect on our net earnings as global commercial enterprise our tax are affected by many our global mix of earnings the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely outside the united legislation and tax of our income our tax are routinely and of raised in these sometimes affect our tax accordingly the determination of our provision for income significant judgment the use of and the interpretation and application of complex tax significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible and taxable and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax will withstand challenge if any from taxing when and change we reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate we account for uncertain tax by the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is to meet before being in the financial this determination the use of judgment in the timing and of
