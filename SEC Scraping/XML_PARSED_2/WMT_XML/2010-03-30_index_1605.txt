on for all other we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial the in certain key in those financial from year to year and the primary that for those as well as how certain accounting affect our financial we also discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess our performance the discussion also information about the financial of the various of our business to provide better understanding of how those and their affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial as of and the year then ended and our comprise three business international and club the segment the mass merchant concept in the united operating under the or mart brand as well as the international segment of the outside of the united the club segment the warehouse membership in the united as well as throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store the company the of its among other each operating income which certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the segment operating income for each segment affected by the is for all to maintain comparability in connection with the finance transformation project we and the classification of certain revenue and expense within our consolidated of income for financial the did not impact operating income or consolidated net income attributable to the were effective and have been reflected in all comparable store is measure which the performance of our by measuring the growth in for such for particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year in fiscal our method of calculating comparable store included all and that were open for at least the previous additionally and that were expanded or converted were from comparable store for the first following the relocation expansion or conversion during fiscal year the company its definition of comparable store for consistency with other as result of that review since definition of comparable store from and open for the previous and in format continue to be from comparable store when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square footage of more than five percent since the impact of this revision is inconsequential the company will not restate comparable store for previously comparable store are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in of our consolidated and the operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to convert the international operating from local into for the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not the retail industry we operate in the highly competitive retail industry in both the united and the we serve internationally we face strong competition from other discount department drug variety and specialty warehouse and many of which are national regional or international as well as based and we compete with number of for prime retail site as well as in and retaining quality whom we call we along with other retail are by number of but not limited to general economic cost of goods consumer disposable income consumer debt and consumer credit availability interest customer unemployment labor inflation deflation currency exchange fuel and energy weather climate change catastrophic competitive and insurance further information on to our company can be in item risk in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on growth the priority of leverage the metric to increase our operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently the company our assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net fiscal ended dollar in millions net total net total net total international club net our net by and in fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year net in fiscal due to customer traffic continued global expansion and the acquisition of our subsidiary in offset primarily by billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact in our international segment and price deflation in certain merchandise in our segment net in fiscal due to our global expansion and comparable store offset by billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact despite the unfavorable impact of currency the international net as percentage of total company net in fiscal and respectively volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the international net in the future comparable store club total club comparable club include fuel fuel had negative impact of percentage in fiscal year and positive impact of and percentage in fiscal and respectively on comparable club comparable store is measure which the performance of our by measuring the growth in for such for particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year comparable store in the united in fiscal and in fiscal although customer traffic in fiscal comparable store in the united were lower than fiscal due to deflation in certain merchandise and lower fuel comparable store in the united in fiscal were higher than fiscal due to an increase in customer traffic as well as an increase in average transaction per customer as we continue to add in the united we do so with an understanding that additional may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store as result of opening was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal with our store growth we expect the impact of on comparable store to stabilize over time leverage fiscal ended dollar in millions total total international club other total operating income we believe growing operating income at faster rate than net growth is meaningful measure because it how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net operating in fiscal operating when to fiscal while net over the same period operating grew at faster rate than net due to higher health benefit and higher advertising in fiscal operating to fiscal while net over the same period operating grew at faster rate than net in fiscal primarily due to higher utility legal higher health benefit and corporate operating income for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net our operating income by when to fiscal while net by over the same period our and international met this objective our club segment fell short of this objective primarily due to million charge to its the closure of for fiscal we did not meet our objective because our operating income by when to fiscal while net by over the same period the and club fell short of this objective due to in operating the international segment fell short of this objective due to for certain legal and in currency exchange return on investment management return on investment is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was percent for both fiscal ended and we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure under the we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its roi before our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as for the dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable based on only and therefore the impact of and the divesture of other of the now japan pursuant to program adopted during the third quarter of fiscal all of these have been disclosed as total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the consolidated balance of million million and million respectively the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating of in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we positive free cash flow of billion billion and billion for the ended and respectively the increase in our free cash flow is primarily the result of operating and inventory management free cash flow is considered non financial measure under the management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating of measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in of the following discussion of our of

technical terminology in our consolidated financial we follow accounting generally accepted in the united these require us to make certain and apply that affect our financial position and of as reflected in our financial these and are based on past and of future actual may differ from our management continually its accounting how they are applied and how they are and disclosed in our financial following is summary of our more significant accounting and how they are applied in preparation of the financial we value our at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting the last in first out lifo method for substantially all our merchandise club merchandise and merchandise in our distribution are valued based on weighted average cost the lifo method for international are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated the first in first out fifo method under the retail method inventory is stated at cost which is determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is based on the initial of beginning inventory plus the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any the retail method management to make certain and that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit made include recording used to sell through inventory and shrinkage when management the salability of inventory for clearance activity and the related cost impact are at the time the price change decision is made considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer related to fashion could cause material in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary the company lifo provision for quarter for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo the company for inventory shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of percentage of the provision is annually to reflect the historical trend of the actual physical inventory count impairment of assets we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and our operational performance such as operating income and cash the evaluation for long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level or in certain at the market group level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that impairment exist and require that impairment be which could result in management that the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be this evaluation management to make to future cash growth and economic and market these are based on the fair value of unit or asset valuation method such as cash flow or relative market based approach historically the company sufficient to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the used in these if different occur in future future operating could be materially impacted income the determination of our provision for income significant judgment the use of and the interpretation and application of complex tax significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible and taxable and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax will withstand challenge if any from taxing when and change we reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate we account for uncertain tax by the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is to meet before being in the financial this determination the use of judgment in the timing and of deductible and taxable self insurance we use combination of insurance self insured retention and self insurance for number of but not limited to compensation general liability vehicle liability and the obligation for employee related health care associated with the that we retain are by considering historical experience frequency severity demographic and other actuarial in calculating our liability we analyze our historical loss development and apply appropriate loss development to the associated with the made against our self insured program the for these could be significantly affected if future or loss development differ from these for example for our compensation and general liability accrual increase or decrease to the for or loss development would increase or decrease our self insurance accrual by million in fiscal our actuarially determined ultimate loss were reduced primarily for our fiscal through compensation and general liability the in ultimate loss primarily from handling experience which loss development and other actuarial due to the beneficial change in estimate of our ultimate for general liability and compensation were reduced by million or million after tax resulting in an increase in net income per
