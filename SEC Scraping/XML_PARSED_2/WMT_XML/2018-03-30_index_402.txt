financial condition and of of the company as whole throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club and other management the of the company each segment operating income certain corporate overhead as well as other from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment operating income certain corporate overhead and other as determined by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period and are to conform to the current period presentation comparable store and club or comparable is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable from and open for the previous and as well as we measure the impact by all or though mobile channel which are through our and of store that in format are from comparable when the conversion of that store is by relocation or expansion that in change in the store retail square of more than five percent additionally related to are until such have been for comparable are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we use the term currency exchange to refer to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar into for financial we calculate the effect of in currency exchange from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and current period activity the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future the retail operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the we serve we face strong competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty warehouse and as well as many of these are national regional or international or have national or international presence we

further information on the that can affect our operating and on certain to our company and an investment in its can be found herein under item risk and under cautionary statement regarding forward looking company performance are to helping save money and live better through everyday low by everyday low at we adjust our business to maintain and strengthen our competitive in the in which we operate our financial framework is defined as strong efficient growth operating discipline capital allocation as we execute on this financial framework we believe our on capital will improve over time strong efficient objective of strong efficient growth we will focus on increasing comparable and growth while the rate of growth of and at we make strategic which are on the long term growth of the company which may not benefit comparable in the near term comparable is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable below we are to our calendar comparable calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable also differ from the retail calendar comparable provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal and were as fiscal ended with sam club total comparable in the fuel and in fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the fiscal total comparable were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement higher and the impact of higher fuel positively impacted comparable approximately for both and sam club for fiscal the fiscal total comparable were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher at the segment partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel primarily due to lower fuel at the sam club segment positively impacted comparable approximately and for and sam club respectively for fiscal in the past when we were on and in the we did so with an understanding that additional and may take away from we reduced the number of store and club in fiscal and the negative impact on comparable as result of these was not significant we expect this trend to continue in the future as well in fiscal we estimate the negative impact on comparable as result of opening and was approximately our estimate was calculated primarily by the of the impacted and which are based on their proximity to the and to those of nearby non impacted and in each case as measured after the and are operating operate with discipline by and the efficiency of how we work we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net growing at faster rate than operating fiscal ended in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative as percentage of net for fiscal operating selling general and administrative operating as percentage of net basis when to the same period in the previous fiscal year while our increase in net and improving expense management had positive impact on our operating as percentage of net we did not leverage as result of approximately billion of related to sam club and real estate approximately million related to lump sum bonus to million related to home office severance legal accrual of million related to the matter charge of million related to real estate and the to exit certain international and wind down the first party brazil strategic capital are more capital to technology and supply chain and less to store and club when to prior this allocation with our of improving our customer proposition in and and digital and physical shopping the following table additional detail in millions fiscal ended allocation of capital and and technology supply chain and other total international total capital total capital fiscal when to the previous fiscal year capital related to and and billion partially offset by to capital for and for technology supply chain and other these were result of our shift in capital allocation strategy to support growth in comparable store and club and while the rate at which we open and we execute our financial framework we believe our on capital will improve over time we measure on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets while roi is considered non financial measure management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term was and for the fiscal ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended roi was and for the fiscal ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and in accordance with for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi the calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as fiscal ended in millions calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating of billion fiscal and respectively we free cash flow of billion fiscal and respectively the in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal were primarily due to the timing of tax and other as well as lapping the previous year in working capital the benefit from the application of tax adopted in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to working capital management additionally we from the application of tax related to the accelerated deduction of and related definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for

to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent the retail method of accounting management to make certain and that may significantly impact the

activity and the related cost impact are considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer could also cause in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary we record lifo provision for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices as measure of sensitivity increase to our retail price indices would not have in decrease to the carrying value of inventory at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo we provide for inventory or shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of historical percentage of following annual inventory the provision is to reflect historical historically our inventory have been materially accurate when to annual inventory and we expect that trend to continue impairment of evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable management regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and financial performance the evaluation of long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that of impairment exist and require impairment be which could result in management the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the related long lived assets although impairment for fiscal were billion these primarily related to as well as real estate in the and to exit certain international impairment not related to or to exit for fiscal were not material and would not change materially with decrease in the undiscounted cash for the with of impairment additionally total impairment for fiscal were not material goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be generally this evaluation with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after an assessment based on the qualitative that the fair value of the unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that fair value of the unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be the quantitative test for impairment management to make to future cash growth and economic and market these are based on the fair value of unit or asset valuation method such as cash flow or relative market based approach historically our and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets have sufficient to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the used in these if different occur in future future operating could be materially impacted for approximately million of certain acquired indefinite lived intangible assets the fair value the carrying value any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge income have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income in the and numerous foreign accordingly the determination of our provision for income significant judgment the use of and the interpretation and application of complex tax our effective income tax rate is affected by many in our assessment of certain tax and in valuation in tax law of administrative the impact of discrete and the mix of earnings among our and international where the statutory are generally lower than the statutory rate and may fluctuate as result our tax are routinely and of raised in these sometimes affect our tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax will withstand challenge if any from taxing when and change we reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate we account for uncertain tax by the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is to meet before being in the financial this determination the use of significant judgment in our tax and the timing and of deductible and taxable deferred tax assets represent available to reduce income payable on taxable income in future such assets arise because of temporary between the financial and tax bases of assets and as well as from net operating loss and tax credit deferred tax assets are for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be many are considered when whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recent cumulative earnings of future taxable income and other relevant quantitative and qualitative the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is by the adequacy of future taxable income from all reversal of taxable temporary operating earnings and available tax this evaluation heavily on on the tax and act of the tax act was and significant to income tax law effective in the tax act the statutory tax rate from percent to percent and on foreign earnings and
