cycle were also well below target ranging from to of target for more information about our performance share unit program which is based on and roi metrics see proxy statement back to contents under our incentive fiscal incentive have been consistently with our performance as in the following graph showing the combined value of the annual cash incentive and long term performance share unit to our over the past three fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal solid operating income performance in fiscal in an annual cash incentive payment to our of approximately million slightly above his target we also had solid and roi performance in fiscal but our long term performance share unit for the three year period ending was million below target due to and roi performance during fiscal and fiscal our was for fiscal and for the three year period ending global retail environment during fiscal in operating income that was below leading to our an annual cash incentive payment of approximately million more than million less than his target we also fell short of and roi resulting in long term performance share unit for the three year period ending that was million below target our was for fiscal and for the three year period ending while our financial performance throughout fiscal we fell short of the operating income and roi established at the beginning of fiscal as result our annual cash incentive was approximately million once again significantly below his target our performance share unit for the three year period ending was million below target our was for fiscal and for the three year period ending proxy statement back to contents shareholder engagement and consideration of last say on pay vote following our annual meeting the considered the of the non binding advisory vote on our executive compensation program say on pay while strongly our executive compensation program with approximately of the cast in support of our say on pay proposal support was not as strong as in the two prior when more than of were cast in support of our executive compensation program during fiscal at the direction of the in addition to our regular with the investment community senior of the company with number of significant as well as with leading proxy advisory to discuss executive compensation governance and other of interest to our we value the feedback provided by our and look forward to this dialogue in these generally expressed positive view of our executive compensation program and its link to performance but enhanced disclosure regarding certain while our expressed wide range of during these key regarding our executive compensation program included the following investor our why dont we use or other relative performance metrics in our executive compensation program while the closely performance relative to when making compensation the determined that there are key in business to other based that make it unworkable to base our pay on relative performance to peer group these include our our significant international our product mix and our variety of additionally the price of stock historically been less volatile than the common stock of most of our retail which relative an imprecise measure of our performance to other as more fully on the that the best approach for is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are with our strategy that can be directly impacted by our and that are designed to promote shareholder value over the long term the made performance easier to achieve in recent no as more fully on page our performance are in line with our operating which are established with input and review by the board these operating are in the context of our long term strategic which are at series of board each year like our operating our performance vary from year to year and reflect economic capital and other strategic for example our operating income and roi reflect our significant ongoing in our commerce and our global compliance program the independent compensation consultant regularly our performance and consistently found them to be conclusion that is by our recent history of below target incentive shown on page above why does the make to our of for incentive plan as more fully on the limited number of positive and negative as by the of our incentive or at the time performance are set these are not outcome driven and are intended to ensure that pay is with performance and that we are the right behavior for example our incentive require that be to remove the effect of store and the that regarding these should not be by of how these may impact incentive similarly should neither be nor due to outside their control such as currency exchange rate why does the sometimes grant special or retention the that targeted special used selectively have proven effective in retaining and key through of leadership transition we believe that the selective use of special been instrumental in our ability to successfully manage two since we the to provide more information regarding the specific rationale for each special award in fiscal see page why do we set performance annually under our long term performance share unit program as global retailer our operating are significantly impacted by outside of our control these along with the rapidly retail landscape make it difficult to forecast accurately over year period similar to the long term incentive used by many performance for our three year performance share unit are set annually and are determined based on average performance over each of the three within each performance cycle see page for more information regarding the rationale for this approach why do we grant feather in performance share unit for newly hired or under our long term incentive plan in appropriate we may make feather in of performance share when are hired or to significantly these feather in result in these an opportunity to realize performance share unit following their first full year in role we believe that this approach to both short and long term performance and also recruiting and retention value it is important to note that when retire or otherwise leave the company all unvested performance share for performance that are still in progress are and we do not accelerate the vesting of any performance share see page for more information proxy statement back to contents our executive compensation we are to executive compensation that drive performance and mitigate risk and that the of our leadership team with the of our below is summary of best that we have and we avoid because we believe they are not in the best of our company or our what we do what we do not do pay for performance significant majority of our target

our are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment based on percentage of base salary this cash incentive payment can range from of target opportunity if threshold performance are met to maximum of of target opportunity long term equity the portion of our of two of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity to the of our with the long term of our and also as

our strategy and can be impacted by our unlike tied to stock price or shareholder return our can have direct impact on our operating income roi and performance these performance are important metrics for retail performance operating income and roi have historically been and continue to be important of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these is important to our similarly is key indicator of commerce performance the that success with respect to these performance will support shareholder value over the long term at the request of the the independent compensation consultant the historical correlation between various performance metrics and within the retail industry the independent compensation consultant found that the metrics used in short and long term incentive are generally with in the retail industry we believe that good performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value over the long term it is unworkable to effectively apply relative performance metrics to executive compensation program there are several key in our business to other publicly in the our our significant international our product mix and our variety of additionally the price of common stock historically been significantly less volatile than the common stock of most of our retail the that these make it unworkable to base our incentive pay on relative

three year for the long term performance share unit program the found that the current approach of setting annually with determined by performance over three year period is the most effective approach for our long term performance share unit program for the following as global retailer operating are significantly impacted by and regional economic outside of control these economic as well as the rapidly retail landscape make it difficult to forecast accurately over three year period for example in fiscal our were performance share with three year and roi performance subsequently the global financial downturn in had the effect of making these three year virtually unachievable only few into the three year performance period the reasoned that performance cease to be an effective tool in performance if the either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve while some attempt to address the impact of by relative in their long term incentive the determined that relative are not the right approach for for the on page above the regularly performance relative to and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive are operating as intended another advantage of our current approach is more easily understandable and better performance which the are more effective in performance as above our incentive are with our business plan and regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on strategic and other setting three year for example would result in situation in which our have three at any one time one for each outstanding of performance share the that the current performance share effectively long term focus with clear and understandable performance why do we adjust of for of our incentive both our annual incentive plan and our stock incentive plan require that certain be made to our of for of calculating incentive the purpose of these is to cause incentive to be calculated on comparable basis from year to year and to ensure that in these are and appropriately many of these substantial majority of the aggregate made during fiscal are that the to make at the time incentive are established by the for example our incentive require that be to remove the effects of currency exchange rate given our significant international which contribute approximately of our total in currency exchange which are generally out of our control often have significant impact on our financial the typically that exclude the impact of fuel because fuel and therefore our fuel are subject to significant fluctuation and are outside of ability to control in light of our significant ongoing in global when the established fiscal operating income for our operating it limited the operating attributable to the of those operating for incentive plan like many other our incentive dictate that we make other to our of for incentive plan for that may not be known at the beginning of the fiscal year when are set for example our require that we make for the impact of store and we do not believe that decision regarding these of should be by consideration of how these might impact the incentive pay of our management the that our compensation should not serve as that could discourage management from making that are in the best of our company and our the rigorous oversight and certification process to determine the by our incentive this process is not outcome driven and both positive and negative while the made for fiscal had net positive impact on incentive this is not always the case for example in fiscal and fiscal the adjustment process in reduction in incentive proxy statement back to contents what were made to fiscal for incentive plan operating cash incentive plan for fiscal the substantial majority of to operating income pursuant to the of our annual cash incentive plan of the following the first three of which are by the of our incentive and the fourth of which was established by the at the time were set in early fiscal an adjustment to remove the impact of currency exchange rate which adjustment had net positive impact on operating income for annual incentive plan to remove the impact of related to store and in the canada and japan which positively impacted operating income for incentive plan to remove the impact for and for litigation related to that in prior generally under prior management which had positive impact on operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan to remove the impact of attributable to and in excess of set limit established by the when were set at the beginning of fiscal from and club operating income which had the effect of increasing operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan other to fiscal operating income for incentive plan included to remove the impact of the following each of which are by the of our incentive related to commerce which positively impacted operating income gains on the sale of real estate and other assets which negatively impacted operating income related to uninsured damage to resulting from hurricane which had the effect of increasing operating income for annual incentive plan these taken together had the effect of increasing the fiscal operating income of our total company and of each operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our as calculated for of our annual cash incentive program as result of these the percentage in fiscal operating income to prior year operating income for of our cash incentive plan as shown in the actual performance as column in the table on page were somewhat greater than the in our publicly operating income for fiscal the table on page above the net impact of these on the operating income of our total company and the operating income attributable to the operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our as calculated for of our cash incentive plan cash incentive plan and long term performance share unit program for fiscal there were two primary to for of our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program both of these were at the time were set in early fiscal an adjustment to exclude fuel which adjustment was at the time the established we generally exclude fuel from our incentive plan due to the high volatility of fuel an adjustment for the impact of currency exchange rate which was also at the time were established this adjustment positively impacted for of our incentive these taken together had the effect of increasing the of our total company and the attributable to each operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our as calculated for of our annual cash incentive plan and performance share unit program as result of these the percentage in fiscal over fiscal for of our incentive as shown in the actual as column in the tables on and were greater than the in reflected in our publicly operating for fiscal as calculated in accordance with the tables on and above show the net impact of these on the of our total company and on the attributable to the operating segment or area of responsibility for each of our as calculated for of our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program term performance share unit program for fiscal the primary difference between our roi and roi for of our performance share unit program is that roi for performance share unit program the impact of currency exchange rate excluding currency exchange rate had the effect of decreasing our roi for fiscal for of our performance share unit program as to our roi in addition when calculating roi for of our performance share unit program we use the operating income used for calculating our annual cash incentive above since these had the effect of increasing fiscal operating income for annual cash incentive plan these also positively impacted roi for performance share unit program and partially offset the negative impact of the currency exchange rate adjustment the table on page above the net impact of this adjustment on our roi as calculated for of our performance share unit program proxy statement back to contents other

performance based cash award opportunity for brewer in the amount of million in order for brewer to earn this award club gross membership income must exceed our business plan for club gross membership income by amount during the one year period ending the this special award opportunity for brewer to drive performance in light of to increase membership and membership income which are key of our club strategy feather in performance share unit under our long term performance share unit program we customarily make additional of performance share to newly hired or when are to significantly these feather in allow to realize performance share unit commensurate with their for three year that are already in progress we believe that this approach to appropriately and reward short and long term

performance share in in connection with his recent promotion to president and of our segment received two additional feather in performance share unit vesting at the conclusion of the performance ending and these additional performance share unit were intended to increase target performance share opportunity for each of those to which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share award in for the performance cycle ending additional award under the of the management incentive plan the may award an additional cash incentive amount based on individual performance for his

generally any that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share unit program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our performance based incentive compensation generally reward mix of different performance namely operating income based based and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure growth to the detriment of performance under another measure return on investment for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our operating income resulting in performance share unit should be offset by in annual cash incentive the regularly the mix and of the performance used in our incentive compensation and that they provide appropriate to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation and return on investment maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program are capped at and of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive annual cash incentive are

some shareholder and supporting may contain about that we believe are incorrect and we have not tried to refute all such in the all in shareholder proposal and its supporting are the sole

president and general counsel corporate division southwest th street the board vote against each of the following shareholder for the set forth in in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that of mart urge the board of board to adopt policy policy that will disclose annually whether in the previous fiscal year any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as result of determination that the senior executive company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the of or detrimental to for of this proposal senior executive former senior executive the policy should provide that the general of the recoupment or forfeiture will be the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind above in the previous fiscal year statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture by law or regulation supporting statement as long term we believe that compensation should promote sustainable value creation we believe disclosure of the application of recoupment forfeiture would encourage ethical conduct and appropriate risk management at by senior about behavioral while discouraging future costly compliance by communicating concrete for misconduct in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon finding of misconduct management incentive plan that the compensation and governance committee committee may recoup all incentive compensation whether or not previously or deferred in the previous if the committee that the recipient engaged in any act inimical to the best of or to comply with and similarly the stock incentive plan sip for forfeiture of outstanding and repayment of received in respect of certain plan in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to best sip section separation with several recently retired senior state that may suspend and recoup made under any agreement with the executive if failure on the part to abide by statement of ethics is discovered never disclosed whether these recoupment forfeiture have been applied making it difficult for to hold of the committee accountable for the as of million in associated with into foreign corrupt act in china and brazil and it was recently that questionable accounting and unauthorized poor at retail business in china for several news mart report found profit by china recoupment disclosure would allow to determine whether compensation from any current or former senior executive for similar misconduct proxy statement back to contents statement in opposition to proposal no the board that vote against this proposal because of comprehensive recoupment and as well as sec disclosure which already require sufficient when the company its recoupment against the board and our management believe compensation should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation offer and other numerous and that give us broad to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to or former who have engaged in misconduct we believe these recoupment are than those provided to the and management of many and reflect strong commitment to ethics and integrity broad recoupment include the following each of which is noted in the proposal our management incentive plan that participant must have with our statement of ethics at all in order to be eligible to receive cash incentive payment moreover participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the within twelve of its payment that prior to the payment the participant any of our or otherwise inimical to the best of the company our stock incentive plan that if the that an associate any act detrimental to the best of the company he or she will forfeit all unexercised and unvested of restricted stock and performance share the stock incentive plan additionally that participant must reimburse the company if the that the participant at any time up to one year after the receipt of an equity award any of our any restrictive or confidentiality or otherwise inimical to the best of the company when an executive officer leaves we generally enter into separation agreement that he associate that the associate with the applicable statement of ethics during the employment the discovery of failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle to suspend and recoup any or due under this agreement or any other between the our statement of ethics among other all from being dishonest acting illegally and between the work and personal and the board are to recoupment when appropriate against current and former to have unethically we already are by sec disclosure to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation been and the amount from our moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation and compensation regarding the we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be further to disclose information taking into account applicable legal the desire of to receive information confidentiality and commercial and other are more properly made on case by case basis report would deprive the board of the ability to exercise judgment and discretion with respect to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information as noted above the disclosure already require to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive who during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such meet the definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure to all current and former senior is warranted in addition recoupment of compensation is not the only sanction that may impose on who violate company or otherwise act contrary to the best of the company for example an misconduct may result in his or her immediate termination from the company thus the report by the proponent which would focus solely on recoupment or forfeiture of incentive or stock compensation could present an incomplete and misleading picture of the full range of the and to penalize and deter associate misconduct in sum the board that this proposal is unnecessary because sec disclosure already require sufficient regarding comprehensive recoupment and and because the report by the proposal would not include the full range of used by to address associate misconduct for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal

should provide equal space and equal treatment of by vote to enhance shareholder value proxy access for proposal proxy statement back to contents statement in opposition to proposal no remains to quality shareholder engagement because it the board to understand and consider the of our during fiscal in addition to our regular with the investment community we with number of significant and leading proxy advisory to discuss of interest to our governance management the about these ongoing and the of interest raised by our we recognize that proxy access is topic of growing interest to of the investment community who share sincere interest in the appropriate composition of company however we do not believe the adoption of this proposal is the right approach for the is comprised entirely of independent non management and it regularly the composition of the board and board as well as the and of our current board throughout each year the in ongoing and extensive board succession the often also advice and input from prominent director search consultant firm this ongoing process is designed to identify and nominate director who possess diverse and complementary mix of and professional experience necessary to oversee our complex global business and who can contribute to the overall effectiveness of our board it also the and the board to evaluate the thoughtful and timely periodic refreshment of the composition of the board proxy access can interrupt and undermine the role of the to guide this critical governance process while our ultimately might reject director candidate in board election process which can be at virtually no cost to shareholder the resulting cost to the company and disruption for the the board and management would be meaningful and therefore would not be in our short or long term already have the ability to recommend director by of the in our governance and in this proxy statement each director candidate by shareholder pursuant to this process is to the and the all shareholder on the same basis as all other director over the our board variety of progressive governance which provide an appropriate balance between the accountability to and the board to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for the long term benefit of all for example each member of the board is annually and for one year term currently of the of our board are independent and of the board are non management board have full access to the and outside the independent annually appoint the lead independent director whose role and have been expanded recently holding or more of outstanding may request special and there are no voting for for shareholder vote therefore the board our corporate governance and the employed by the for the nomination and election of have led to board that is responsive to shareholder input and strategy of long term value creation for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy

not believe the adoption of this proposal is appropriate for at this time the in global climate stewardship are testament to the collective that our and external take to operate more efficiently and more our current and which are in more detail in our most recent global responsibility report have been by research to identify the of in our business and supply chain which us to focus our on those where our can have the impact in these we consider the scale of potential impact we can have on as well as our ability to influence that impact in meaningful way for example according to the world shipping council maritime shipping is the most carbon efficient form of transporting goods with footprint that is less than half of rail and less than one fifth of trucking see industry environment air carbon in the world shipping council total of million twenty foot equivalent were in the global market see about the industry global trade trade statistics by comparison the in this proposal approximately of the total number of in the market therefore in the area of transportation related our have primarily on trucking because of its impact and our greater ability to influence that area our are showing we recently we are of the way to our goal of doubling efficiency and we remain to these efficiency and related criteria along with other business relevant on time shipping in our evaluation of maritime and other however our ability to directly influence produced by international marine shipment of is limited by the number of cargo who can accurately track and report their therefore in the clean cargo working group along with other who collectively are engaged on this topic and who already are on more sustainable shipping the clean cargo working group is global business to business initiative made up of leading cargo and their and it is to environmental performance improvement in marine container transport was one of the initial of supply chain furthermore over the last three we have the number of our who are to participate in the carbon disclosure process the response rate every year and most recently included over given the framework and outlined above the board management and specifically our subject matter who are more familiar with the logistics supply chain is best situated to make prudent affecting our business and to evaluate how best to leverage our ability to influence the reduction of globally we believe can best address the effect of on climate change by to monitor and report on our current comprehensive and regularly communicating our progress as we have done for the prior seven for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no request for annual report regarding incentive resolved that of mart urge the board of the board to adopt policy that the compensation and governance committee the committee will annually analyze and report to at reasonable expense and proprietary information on whether incentive compensation and considered together provide appropriate to discourage senior from making that result in of return on investment roi taking into account the following over the previous three the relationship between growth in capital and growth in operating income in roi the relationship between same store growth also known as comparable store and total growth made to in connection with the measurement of performance for incentive and the extent to which at open for more than one year declined because of at newly cannibalization rate supporting statement as and long term we believe that incentive compensation for senior should encourage sustainable value creation we are concerned that recent by the committee may overemphasize growth even when that growth in of roi and in some does not produce that cover the cost of capital specifically the replacement of same store metric repeatedly as critically total growth as the metric under performance share program encouraging senior to invest in even if doing so to cannibalization of and lower roi during the last five fiscal revenue at the us division grew by about but comparable store declined during that period capital grew at more than twice the rate of growth our we estimate that during this period the rate of percentage of store which us and club above that the use of growth for the annual incentive plan the and roi metrics used in the long term plan yet the addition of growth to the annual plan this claim the measure to ensure that our incentive reward underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of our proxy statement at these have in all but one of the past five in in the metric used to award performance in from an upward adjustment for the lost to in the federal food stamp program even after had publicly any potential impact presumably the business to minimize the impact of these would have been well within the control of we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no we understand shareholder interest in the structure of our annual cash incentive plan and the long term performance share component of our stock incentive plan in response to this increasing shareholder interest we provided additional information in the this year regarding the goal setting process and made for of our incentive in keeping with our pay for performance philosophy and as in more detail in the included in this proxy statement our approach is designed to focus our leadership and balance short term performance and long term strategic moreover under our compensation have been closely with our operating return on investment roi is key performance measure used in the amount of compensation our receive through our incentive roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with short term generally our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion the company may make strategic that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net as in our public filings in our roi often are foreign currency exchange rate and continued proxy statement back to contents in store growth and equipment strategic are not always limited to and but also the who are responsible for superior customer in our and for example in we of over billion during fiscal for comprehensive to our compensation and training the importance of roi performance to our total compensation is in the narrative in the in this proxy statement and is clearly in included in the approximately of our total direct compensation for fiscal was based on performance related to roi operating income gross merchandise value or combination of these metrics this approach also is reflected in the performance based total direct compensation for our over the prior five fiscal even slight fluctuation in roi performance can lead to meaningful reduction in our performance share based incentive compensation as in the we fell short of our target roi goal for fiscal under our long term incentive plan this in each of our falling short of target performance under the performance share program in fiscal further because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only does this result in lower performance share for fiscal but it will also impact our performance share for fiscal and as well the is responsible for and the attainment of performance under our performance based incentive compensation the of the discharge this responsibility with high degree of care and professionalism executive compensation and incentive compensation at multiple throughout the year through its regular review and approval of the performance applicable to performance based compensation the already whether our incentive compensation appropriately our senior to achieve our strategic the strategic priority of this year the again that the design of our performance based incentive compensation an appropriate balance between rewarding both annual and long term performance and the risk that our senior will make that overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of the company as whole moreover the independent compensation consultant an analysis of the correlation performance metrics used in our executive compensation program and total shareholder return and that these metrics support value creation for our furthermore our have an adequate opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of the incentive compensation and by of the annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our the via the included in the annual proxy also already to on an annual basis regarding the relationship between our incentive compensation and the roi performance and how the roi performance may have meaningful impact on the amount of compensation our receive commensurate with its the to analyze whether the performance used in our incentive compensation properly our senior to achieve the strategic in light of our business strategy and consistent with the and of the sec the analyses of our incentive compensation will continue to be to in our annual proxy because the already regularly whether our incentive compensation provide proper to our to achieve our strategic roi and because our already receive annual on those in the in our annual proxy we believe the adoption of the policy by the proposal is unnecessary duplicative of already by the and our company and would result in an expenditure of and our and time that ultimately would not be in our best for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no independent chairman policy resolved the of mart the company ask the board of to adopt policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be director who not previously as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these director shall not be considered independent if during the last three he or she was with company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had personal service contract with the company or its senior management was with company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or of its gross annual from the company had business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under the and exchange commission been employed by public company at which an executive officer of the company as director had relationship of the sort above with any affiliate of the company and was spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person above the policy should be without any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if current chairman to be independent between annual shareholder compliance with the policy may be if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement the board of led by its chairman is responsible for protecting long term by providing independent oversight of management the chief executive officer in the this oversight can be when the chairman is not independent an independent chairman who and for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and ensure the objective of an effective board we view the alternative of lead outside director even one with robust set of as adequate only in exceptional fully disclosed by the board recent ongoing into bribery and corruption at the in china brazil and of accounting fraud at the china recent ruling by national labor board administrative law judge against the company for its illegal discipline of and the decision to authorize nationwide complaint against the company for of the national labor act highlight the need for enhanced oversight of corporate culture and behavior board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change several recommend chair independence corporate core and state that the independence of majority of the board is not enough the leadership of the board must embrace independence and it must ultimately change the way in which interact with management we urge you to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no always strived to maintain high corporate governance in keeping with this goal and unlike many other in the fortune the board the of chairman and since we believe this separation of our to focus on complex daily we also believe that separate chairman on oversight and governance the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have number of other key corporate governance in place to see that our board independently of management the following lead independent director since our board an independent director to serve as lead independent director as can be seen in our corporate governance the lead independent director is annually by the independent of the board and the of
