support in the leverage discussion of the company performance metrics consist of corporate overhead and other not to any of the company table of store and club is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as commerce we measure the commerce impact by those through our and through our commerce distribution as well as an estimate for but through our and in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to understand better underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense have been among to be comparable with the current period presentation company performance performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and our priority of growth on through comparable store and club commerce and unit square growth the priority of leverage our objective to increase our operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently we employ assets through return on investment and how effectively we manage working capital through free cash flow ended six ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for the three and six respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year the in net were primarily due to year over year growth in retail square and higher commerce across the company as well as strategic price investment and assortment in international these were partially offset by billion respectively of negative impact from in currency exchange for the three and six table of comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and six and were as three ended six ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel were relatively flat for both and six when to the same in the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club were negatively impacted by the reduction in government food for the three and six severe winter which during the first quarter of fiscal also had negative impact for the six commerce positively impacted comparable store approximately and positively impacted sam club comparable club approximately for each of the three and six month table of ended six ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe both the growth of our operating and our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three and six operating and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year accordingly we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net for either period higher health care in the from enrollment and medical cost inflation was the primary factor that us not to leverage for the three and six in addition severe winter in the to the increase in operating as percentage of net for the six higher net and expense management in the international segment partially offset the in operating as percentage of net operating the three and six we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net as operating income and respectively while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the we for not operating as well as lower gross profit rate in each of our table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to decrease in operating income as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and commerce we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for

flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth

working capital deficit was and respectively the decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily due to the decrease in short term further below and the increase in our inventory in each of our primarily from lower than and store growth timing also to the decrease in our working capital deficit we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in consistent access to the capital and in providing to our in the form of share and of cash we employ global in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through other ongoing cash from external or both accordingly we intend with only certain to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash outside of the in our foreign when the income either from or through global and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the within our

of our credit by credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing or impair our ability to access capital and credit on commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current
