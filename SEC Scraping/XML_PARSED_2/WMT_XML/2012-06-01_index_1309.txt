financial of the various of our business to provide better understanding of how those and their affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole this discussion to and its consolidated and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial as of and the included in part item of this quarterly report on form as well as our consolidated financial as of the and the related discussion and analysis of financial condition and of in our annual report to for the year ended and incorporated by reference in and included as an exhibit to our annual report on form for

extent due to different calendar and national and religious as well as different climatic historically the highest volume and operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending which the holiday season and the volume and operating income occur during the fiscal quarter ending throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store and club the company the of its among other each operating income certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the other in the leverage discussion of the performance metrics include corporate overhead and other comparable store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as in format continue to be from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange that we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or excluding the effect of to understand better our underlying performance table of the effects of currency exchange rate or we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain segment asset and expense have been among in the current period company performance performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on through comparable store or club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow ended dollar in millions net international club net our consolidated net for the three when to the three the increase in net is primarily result of growth in retail square of from of billion and positive comparable store and club the extra day from leap year during the three also added approximately basis to net these were partially offset by million of negative impact from in currency exchange calendar comparable store and club store and club is measure which the performance of our and by measuring the growth in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and are as three ended with club total table of ended dollar in millions operating international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three operating when to the same period in the previous year while net over the same period operating due to additional associate incentive and continued investment in our global for the three we operating operating operating income grew by for the three when to the same period in the previous year while net by when to the same period in the previous year although operating income in the current period we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net primarily because we experienced decline in our gross profit as percentage of net gross profit rate our gross profit rate declined due to price investment as we are expense back into for our and not passing on the full impact of cost inflation this price investment strategy gradually what our pay and accordingly our gross rate to decline additionally operating income for the three was negatively impacted by million due to in currency exchange volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the operating income in the future on return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing month ended and respectively roi was negatively impacted by capital and acquisition related partially offset by positive currency exchange rate we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital table of roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as dollar in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million respectively table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of to negative the three and respectively the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to improvement in inventory management timing related to associate incentive and strong operating performance free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash provided by used in three ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow table of of following discussion of our
