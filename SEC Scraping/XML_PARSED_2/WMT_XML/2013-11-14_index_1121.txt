press release that are calculated and in accordance with such non financial should not be considered superior to as substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the financial in the press release the non financial in the press release may differ from similar used by other calculation of return on investment and return on return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline was principally due to in fixed assets growth in working capital and the impact of we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as mart return on investment and return on twelve in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation

total assets of as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the company condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively free cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was the nine ended and respectively timing of associated with and as well as higher capital were the primary of the reduction free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in nine in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current

underlying diluted earnings per share from attributable to underlying for the three and the fiscal year to end is considered non financial measure under the because the underlying for each such period certain not included in the range of diluted earnings per share from attributable to calculated in accordance with for the three and the fiscal year to end management that the underlying for the three and the fiscal year to end is meaningful metric to share with because that metric which for each of such for certain to be in the three to end is the metric that best with the for the three and the fiscal year ended respectively in addition the metric view of for core earnings performance for the three and the fiscal year to end and the ability to make more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for each of such when to earnings performance for the three and the fiscal year ended respectively we have calculated the range of underlying for the three and the fiscal year to end by to the range of for each such period the approximate amount of the dilutive impact of the ending of retail franchise agreement in the transaction and the closure of approximately under in brazil and china the store on for the three to end for the three and the fiscal year to end is the financial measure calculated in accordance with that is most directly comparable to the underlying
