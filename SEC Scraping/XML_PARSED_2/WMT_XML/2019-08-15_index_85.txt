include return on assets which is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting as well as return on investment roi as to assess on assets management roi is meaningful measure to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with possible short term we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the increase in was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve primarily resulting from lapping the billion net loss in fiscal related to the sale of the majority stake in brazil and the and impairment

primarily as result of lapping the and impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the denominator relatively flat as the billion increase in average total assets due to the acquisition was offset by the decrease in average capital resulting from the removal of the eight rent factor upon adoption of since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period upon adoption of rent for the trailing by factor of is no longer included in the calculation of roi on prospective basis as operating lease assets are now for fiscal lease related assets and associated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date rather than because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing

which the hypothetical capitalization of our operating because the lease standard was adopted prospectively as of our calculation of roi for the comparable fiscal period was not recast our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial measure numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management
