the most directly comparable financial calculated and in accordance with generally accepted accounting the company provided the non financial information in the press release which is not calculated or in accordance with as information supplemental and in addition to the financial in the press release that are calculated and in accordance with such non financial should not be considered superior to as substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the financial in the press release the non financial in the press release may differ from similar used by other free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billion and billion for the nine month ended and respectively free cash flow is considered non financial measure under the management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for

used in net cash used in calculation of return on investment and return on assets management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was percent and percent for the trailing ended and respectively we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure under the we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge to understand the used by another company to calculate its roi before our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as mart return on investment and return on assets dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude
