of roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve ended and respectively roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the in and roi were primarily due to our decrease in operating income we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during

plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial measure numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi non roi the calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as mart return on assets and return on investment trailing twelve ended trailing twelve ended in

period we had net cash provided by operating of billion and billion for the three ended and respectively we free cash flow of billion and billion for the three ended and respectively the in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate
