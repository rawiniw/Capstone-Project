communication will be sent to certain of mart dear shareholder mart or the company is holding its annual meeting on june we are writing to ask for your support at the annual meeting by voting in accordance with the of our board of the board on all this letter is intended to supplement our proxy statement which is available on corporate at stock annual particularly we are your support by voting for proposal no advisory vote to approve executive officer compensation and the election of and duke to the board pursuant to proposal no election of in how to vote on the we encourage you to read the relevant of our proxy statement and consider the supplemental information below proposal no advisory vote to approve executive officer compensation independent proxy advisory firm glass lewis agreed with the board and vote for proposal no institutional shareholder another proxy advisory firm vote against this proposal we believe that analysis the nature and operation of executive compensation program we believe are incorrect and inconsistent with prior analyses the primary difference this year to be the submission of letter may from investment group which number of and intentionally our executive compensation program is union group that long and consistent track record of opposing with its sole motive being to undermine the company in an attempt to organize as in its report own quantitative analysis that executive pay is of low concern with executive pay with performance and that pay is low relative to the median of its itself further that compensation not historically been particular concern at mart most of its program meet best practice and pay disclosed for raised no in pay for performance screen most of the program and made with respect to to do not on an individual basis raise significant concern in the context of the company and comparable compensation and as in our proxy statement executive compensation program performance and is intended to closely the of our executive or with the of our the compensation and governance committee the regularly our executive compensation program to ensure that compensation is closely tied to of our performance that our executive can impact and that are likely to have an impact on shareholder value moreover the compensation by our for the fiscal year ending fiscal that our performance based incentive are working as designed our financial performance during fiscal was below our at the beginning of the fiscal year and our pay for fiscal reflected that performance because fiscal operating income was lower than the management incentive plan payment or the cash bonus payment for each of our six was below target and significantly less as to the prior year bonus was approximately million less bonus was nearly less was more than less was more than less ashes was less and was less see annex for additional information regarding cash bonus to each of these we fell short of and return on investment roi resulting in the of performance share in several for our based on fiscal performance the performance share for duke and brewer were under percent of target for each while their three year performance cycle was less than percent of the target because our performance generally have three year performance period with the ultimate at the end of that period based on the average performance of the three fiscal during that performance period the fiscal performance will also impact our performance share in fiscal and even after fiscal cash bonus and performance share were historically low we believe our executive compensation program is working the way it should we acknowledged that our performance in fiscal did not meet our and our compensation reflected that performance are rigorous and in line with operating that relaxed its performance from year to year this is not accurate the intent as in the proxy statement is to set but achievable each year the roi operating income and revenue used in our incentive compensation are set at the beginning of each fiscal year and are based on our operating and at that time for fiscal these took into account difficult global retail operating environment as well as our in global and to ongoing regarding of the foreign corrupt act the and compliance as in the compensation discussion and analysis the of our proxy statement on page are set so that in order to achieve target we must perform in line with our and operating to believe it is troubling that the roi under long term performance share program have declined over the past few however this decline does not represent decreasing difficulty in roi we have been very deliberate about our strategy for continued growth and the we are making in the business as in our quarterly earnings recent in our roi are largely driven by capital such as strategic in and in and technology and related and global compliance we believe that criticism of our recent in roi is really criticism of our business model and strategic direction and not an executive compensation issue we believe that the increase in our stock price during the last five fiscal which in more than billion increase in our market capitalization that our believe in our further its recommendation in part by in performance that do not result in any decline in related even as the company performance to lag with respect to roi roi does not lag even as the cash and stock by our declined significantly in fiscal our fiscal roi of us above the of our retail peer group moreover there is no long term downward trend in our and operating income as in fact it is not even correct to say that our and operating in fiscal were lower than the prior year for fiscal in and operating income were necessary to achieve target performance just at lower rate of increase than for fiscal further fiscal and fiscal operating income growth as to the prior fiscal we do not believe it would be prudent to set unrealistic that are not achievable and that would not serve to performance rather we set but achievable that are consistent with our operating and as noted above during fiscal we fell short of our operating and and as result the performance based compensation by our was well below target clearly the set by the for fiscal were not excessively easy to achieve and we believe that characterization of the as relaxed is incorrect and misunderstanding of the purpose and operation of our incentive compensation to operating are appropriate and the result of rigorous also to operating under our incentive compensation even though its report that such are not an uncommon practice we believe that for such as store and are appropriate and are intended to cause incentive pay to be calculated on comparable basis from year to year for example we do not want decision regarding or store which may be in the long term best of the company and our to be by consideration of how it might impact our our compensation should not from making the right that support our strategy for our business are not intended to increase incentive pay or enrich in some such as fiscal and fiscal the adjustment process in reduction in incentive are by the of our incentive compensation and rigorous oversight and analysis process and are not outcome driven special retention are appropriate in the context of special restricted stock to our made for retention in these were made in the context of transition on that took effect on we have successfully executed the last two primarily due to the strong focus on succession and bench strength of our leadership team additionally the that our current leadership team is instrumental in successfully our strategic we believe that these special restricted stock were appropriate and reasonable in order to retain our senior leadership team for future succession and delivery of our ongoing strategic feather in performance are reasonable and also to of additional long term performance for ongoing performance made to certain of our in we note that although we do not grant additional performance for ongoing performance as matter of course we have made such in limited where we believe there is compelling reason to do so we have clearly disclosed these in our proxy statement in past and we have never received any negative feedback from any shareholder or from for that matter as the award for was designed to deliver the potential to earn at the appropriate level of target performance for his position for each year he that position the additional performance for and brewer as with the special restricted stock were made in the context of our ongoing transition and succession and reflected the of the rigorous process in our the run by our are similar in or than many of our retail peer making our very attractive to other the additional performance were to maintain competitive total direct compensation for and brewer moreover it is important to note that all unvested performance are upon separation from the company and unlike some we do not accelerate the vesting of unvested performance when an executive both of our last two all unvested performance for ongoing performance upon retirement from our company specifically upon his retirement lee unvested performance while duke unvested performance upon his retirement election of and duke to the also that vote against the election of and duke to the board bases this recommendation on the assertion that the board not to date meaningful information to about any specific the related and whether will be accountable for related compliance emphasis added the audit committee and the company are following the appropriate protocol for an independent thorough the company previously the audit committee of the board is an independent internal investigation into among other of the and misconduct in connection with foreign also as previously to the company voluntarily disclosed the audit investigative activity on these to the department of justice and the and exchange commission both of which are their own external of these we believe that recommendation that vote against the election of and duke because the board not disclosed specific regarding the related is at odds with the appropriate conduct of such internal and external we further believe that request for disclosure of specific with respect to these ongoing is contrary to the best of the company and our because such disclosure could interfere with or distract from the ongoing is impractical given that no final or have been made and could adversely impact the position in any current or future legal that may relate to these the audit committee of the board will continue to oversee thorough independent internal investigation of these and the company will continue to with all governmental investigating these the company can not comment on any specific of these ongoing this course of action is consistent with best for that these of are thoroughly and are timely resolved that the company made significant progress in its compliance that the clearly made significant to its compliance in the past year and provided better disclosure regarding its compliance the board and duke been instrumental in these compliance which have anti corruption and in
