in the fiscal quarter ending this discussion which our for in the fiscal year ending fiscal and the fiscal year ended fiscal should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial as of and for the three and six ended and the included in part item of this quarterly report on form as well as our consolidated financial as of and for the year ended the and the related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and of in our annual report of form for the year ended incorporated by reference we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial the in certain key in those financial from period to period and the primary that for those we also discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess the company performance additionally the discussion information about the financial of each of the three of our business to provide better understanding of how each of those and its of affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club and other management the of the company each segment operating income certain corporate overhead as well as other from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment operating income and other as determined by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker in fiscal the company certain of its corporate overhead to the operating and accordingly prior period for comparability comparable store and club or comparable is metric that the performance of our and measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable from and open for the previous and as well as we measure the impact by all or though mobile channel which are through our and at store that in format are from comparable when the conversion of that store is by relocation or expansion that in change in the store retail square of more than five percent additionally related to are until such have been for comparable are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we use the term currency exchange to refer to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar into for financial we calculate the effect of in currency exchange from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and current period activity the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future table of retail operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the we serve we face strong competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty warehouse and as well as many of these are national regional or international or have national or international presence we compete with number of for prime retail site as well as in and retaining quality we along with other retail are by number of but not limited to catastrophic weather competitive consumer disposable income consumer debt and consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate customer deflation inflation fuel and energy general economic insurance interest labor tax and unemployment company performance are to helping save money and live better through everyday low by everyday low at we adjust our business to maintain and strengthen our competitive in the in which we operate we define our financial framework as strong efficient growth operating discipline capital allocation as we execute on this financial framework we believe our on capital will improve over time strong efficient objective of strong efficient growth we will focus on increasing comparable store and club and growth while the rate of growth of and at we make strategic which are on the long term growth of the company comparable is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable below we are to our calendar comparable calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable also differ from the retail calendar comparable provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable as well as the impact of fuel for the three and six ended were as three ended six ended with sam club total comparable in the fuel and for the three and six ended respectively when to the same period in the previous fiscal year total comparable were driven by strong comparable growth at both the and sam club the segment had growth of and for the three and six ended respectively driven by ticket and traffic growth and by warmer weather in the second quarter for the three and six ended the segment positively impacted comparable by approximately and respectively comparable at the sam club segment were and for the three and six ended respectively driven by strong traffic which is partially due to of from our closed to our the increase in comparable at the sam club segment was partially offset by reduced tobacco the sam club segment positively impacted comparable by approximately for both the three and six ended table of operate with discipline by and the efficiency of how we work we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net growing at faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating three ended six ended in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative as percentage of net for the three and six ended we operating which and basis as percentage of net when to the same in the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage was strong performance in conjunction with productivity that more than offset in and technology strategic capital are more capital to store technology and supply chain and less to store and club when to prior this allocation with our of improving our customer proposition in and and digital and physical shopping the following table additional detail in millions six ended allocation of capital technology supply chain and other and and total international total capital although capital relatively flat in total how we capital varied consistent with our shift in capital allocation strategy we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets while roi is considered non financial measure management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with possible short term was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve which was the result of the billion net loss related to the sale of majority stake in brazil on extinguishment of debt in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal on our investment and and impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in roi was due to the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve which was primarily driven by the and impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally an increase in average total assets also to the decline of roi primarily driven by our higher cash balance at as result of our recent billion net proceeds from issuance of long term debt and in the value of our investment table of define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial measure numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi the calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in the same period we had net cash provided by operating of the six and respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating was primarily due to the timing of vendor partially offset by decrease in tax primarily as result of the tax reform and act of tax reform we free cash flow of billion for the six ended which was relatively flat to billion for the six ended definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in six ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in net cash used in for property

in the future net for the sam club segment and for the three and six respectively when to the same period in the previous fiscal year the decrease in net for the three and six primarily due to the net

due to our efficient use of cash in consistent access to the capital and provided to our in the form of of cash and share the reduced working capital deficit at to was due to higher cash balance from
