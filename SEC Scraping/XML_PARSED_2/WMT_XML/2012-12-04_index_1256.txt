measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange that we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant table of or to understand better our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense have been among to be comparable with the current period presentation company performance performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on through comparable store or club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow ended nine ended dollar in millions net international club net our consolidated net and for the three and nine respectively when to the same in the previous year due to year over year growth in retail square and positive comparable store and club across the company in addition net of the fiscal through their respective anniversary in fiscal for billion of the increase in net for the nine ended when to the same period in the previous year these were partially offset by billion and billion of negative impact from in currency exchange for the three and nine respectively calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and nine and were as three ended nine ended with club total table of ended nine ended dollar in millions operating international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three and nine operating and respectively when to the same in the previous year while net and respectively when to the same in the previous year operating primarily due to additional associate incentive and continued investment in our global for the three and nine additionally operating included related to third party the foreign corrupt act of the three and nine respectively fiscal also operating for the nine we met our objective of operating for the three and nine operating the three and nine operating income grew by and respectively when to the same in the previous year while net by and respectively when to the same in the previous year although in currency exchange negatively impacted operating income by million and million for the three and nine respectively we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net for the three and nine on return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve month ended and respectively the slight reduction in roi is primarily due to the negative impact of currency exchange rate the effect of which was partially offset by reduction in as result of our focus on capital discipline we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital table of roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending dollar in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million respectively table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the nine to free cash flow of the same period in the previous year the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of for operating and more approach to capital investment free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management

respectively volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the international net in the future gross profit rate basis for the three when to the same period in the previous year primarily due
