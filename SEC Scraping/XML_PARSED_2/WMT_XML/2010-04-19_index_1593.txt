analysis executive summary overview in the following we discuss how our and certain other current executive our executive or were in fiscal and describe how this compensation within our executive compensation philosophy during fiscal under the leadership of our senior executive team our company well we strong financial for the fiscal year particularly our earnings despite continued economic our earnings for fiscal significantly the end of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year our free cash flow significantly over fiscal and we finished the fiscal year with strong balance sheet our company continued to deliver stable tax with return on investment for fiscal the same as return on investment for fiscal our stock price slightly during fiscal and we returned more than billion to our in the form of us continued to grow faster than and continued to manage inventory effectively with inventory down percent versus the prior year and us to be well positioned in the current economic environment comparable store at us were slightly down in fiscal international continued its strong growth with increasing above club also experienced continued growth with comparable club excluding fuel increasing with fuel comparable club slightly club also reduced inventory by percent these in the compensation below for fiscal with our cash incentive plan which is based on profitability paying out at or near maximum our performance share plan which is based on return on investment and metrics in to our that were between threshold and target the total compensation by our in fiscal was reflective of our overall strong performance our compensation program performance we design our neo compensation with an emphasis on performance base salary typically less than percent of each total annual compensation opportunity and substantial majority of each annual compensation is contingent on meeting performance that we believe have meaningful impact on shareholder value the regularly our executive compensation to ensure that compensation is closely tied to performance that can be by our and that we believe is likely to impact shareholder value our annual cash incentive is based on the profitability of our company and or one or more operating depending on each our performance share program is based on total company return on investment as well as the performance of one or more operating depending on each area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating the risk that our would be to pursue good with respect to single metric or operating division to the detriment of our company as whole in addition our executive compensation program to balance rewarding long term performance with shorter term performance our cash incentive plan is based on single fiscal year while our performance share plan is based on financial performance over three year period our also receive service based restricted stock which typically in equal on the second fourth and fifth of the grant date our company and each of our operating had strong earnings performance for fiscal because our cash incentive plan is based on tax profit and operating income our received cash incentive for fiscal that were at or near the maximum potential conversely our comparable store and club for fiscal were not as strong as we when performance were set in early fiscal because our performance share program is based in part on performance versus metrics under our performance share program were below the target performance for that program the cash and performance by our for fiscal are in more detail below because it is our goal to provide our with performance based compensation on criteria they can impact we consider underlying operational performance to ensure that operating for the fiscal year are comparable to the prior year during fiscal the most significant were to remove the impact of in currency exchange and certain in the fourth quarter the made for of fiscal performance under our compensation are in more detail below table of contents executive compensation overview who are our for fiscal our were duke our president and duke our company in and in number of vice chairman prior to becoming president and in our executive vice president and our company in wright our vice chairman wright our company in our executive vice president president and of international our company in our executive vice president president and of club our company in what are the primary of our executive compensation program the annual compensation of our of three main base salary performance based annual cash incentive payment and annual equity based compensation comprised of long term performance based award and long term service based award for of setting neo compensation the the amount that each neo could earn from these three assuming performance are and all service based equity vest as that total direct compensation or we discuss each of these of in greater detail below in addition our may from time to time receive special equity special are typically for retention or in recognition of extraordinary performance fiscal compensation what were the significant to our executive compensation program for fiscal there were no significant to our compensation program for in fiscal prior to setting neo compensation for fiscal the undertook comprehensive review and analysis of our executive compensation program to determine if any could be made to tie executive compensation more closely to performance and to otherwise our executive compensation program more closely with shareholder for fiscal we further refined the performance metrics for our performance share program by distinguishing between us comparable store and or club comparable club depending on the primary area of responsibility what was the for each of our during fiscal and fiscal when setting neo compensation the amount for each neo and then that among the various of compensation the compensation opportunity available to an neo for given fiscal year if performance are as shown in the table below target the our would receive if target performance are maximum the that our would receive if maximum performance are and is therefore intended to reflect the our would receive only in the event of exceptional performance the summary compensation table that on page specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal for our in the manner by sec the in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation by the for our nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation actually by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance for example our typically neo compensation for the upcoming fiscal year in prior to the start of our fiscal year on as result the equity that appear in the summary compensation table as in particular fiscal year are typically part of an compensation package for the following fiscal year table of contents the following table the established for each neo for fiscal and fiscal inclusion of this information is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the decision making process when neo compensation for of the table below is defined as the sum of base salary potential annual performance based cash incentive and grant date value of annual equity assuming performance are satisfied because is established through process as below does not include any one time or special as these of are generally not reflected in the data that is available for our peer group fiscal fiscal name target maximum target maximum duke wright duke was from vice chairman to president and effective effective wright was from executive vice president president and us to vice chairman effective was from executive vice president president and club to executive vice president president and international the in for fiscal shown above for messrs duke wright and are reflective of these increase in is primarily attributable to an increase in the value of his annual equity award the determined that performance in fiscal was strong as by our excellent financial management and strong balance sheet the also determined that annual equity value and as result his was relatively low given his performance and level of experience the annual process is in detail below was as executive vice president president and club effective the above for are shown on an basis significant percentage of the shown above of performance based cash and equity for example for fiscal approximately percent of our target of performance and an additional percent of his target of his cash incentive opportunity the in among our are due to that the in and the compensation of our these include the in job scope and among our the review of peer group compensation information through peer which is in more detail below and of experience historical compensation retention and succession and individual and where relevant divisional performance the set forth in the table above represent the judgment as to the appropriate compensation in light of these and are not the result of any specific policy or formula table of contents how is the of our among the various of compensation each is comprised of the following base salary annual cash incentive opportunity and equity each equity award is comprised of performance and restricted stock for fiscal the majority of each target to performance based of compensation as breakdown of fiscal target name restricted stock performance based compensation all performance based compensation plus cash target at target at target duke wright in this table reflect the percentage of target by the particular element of compensation these have been rounded to the nearest tenth of percent and may not total percent due to rounding base salary in keeping with our philosophy that substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the typically less than percent of to base salary because our more senior typically have large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our advance in our company and assume with greater for fiscal and fiscal our base were as name fiscal fiscal duke wright in the base of our the also the base for our against base within our peer to ensure that our base are appropriately competitive the typically to set base near the th percentile of our peer the will set base higher or lower if necessary to result in in the quartile of our peer or if necessary to result in an appropriate mix of performance based versus fixed compensation the process is in more detail below the base salary shown above for messrs duke and are result of their and are reflective of their received percent increase in base salary which is in line with base salary for management generally who are to be at high level base salary is shown on an basis cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management our are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment calculated as percentage of base salary whether an incentive payment is and the amount of the incentive payment depend on whether we achieve established performance for fiscal as for the past several fiscal these were based on growth in tax profit for the total company and on growth in operating income for each of the incentive are also based on diversity table of contents in addition beginning in fiscal we added an individual performance component to the management incentive plan under the plan as the may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target for that neo based upon the subjective evaluation of that individual performance for fiscal and fiscal our had the opportunity to earn the following cash expressed as percentage of base salary name threshold target maximum duke wright the in cash incentive opportunity for duke and are due to their the actual cash by our for fiscal performance are on page below equity the balance of is then between various of equity compensation we believe that equity that vest over period of time help to the of our with the of our consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance for fiscal as in fiscal approximately three quarters of the annual equity value to our was in the form of performance with the remainder in the form of restricted stock performance performance share award the officer it the right to receive number of if we meet certain performance during performance period if an associate who performance to be employed by us before the end of the applicable performance period the performance do not vest and the recipient no for those performance generally performance to our have three year performance period for performance share prior to the applicable performance metrics were return on investment and revenue growth beginning in fiscal we the revenue growth metric used in prior performance share with comparable store and club improvement metric and or growth in international revenue metric depending on the area of responsibility these metrics are in more detail below restricted stock the percent of the equity value to each neo was in the form of restricted stock which is to vest in three equal on the second fourth and fifth of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting the value of the equity to our for fiscal and fiscal assuming target performance under the performance share metrics is as name fiscal fiscal duke wright because the these equity prior to the beginning of the fiscal year these are included in the summary compensation table as compensation for the prior fiscal year the in and equity for fiscal were primarily result of their to their current and our process below the increase in annual equity value is primarily due to the determination through its process that equity value was relatively low given his performance and level of experience table of contents do our receive any compensation that is not included in on occasion we grant our our special equity that are not included in these are generally in the form of restricted stock and are intended for retention and or to reward exceptional performance in in connection with their to their present the in performance based restricted stock to both duke and wright the vesting of these was contingent on our company at least percent revenue growth in fiscal in march the certified that this performance condition had been satisfied these continue to be subject to service based vesting with award to vest on and award to vest on june reflective of their the in late fiscal also in and performance with performance ending and respectively these equity are in the summary compensation table on page as part of fiscal compensation as result the for duke and wright in the stock column of the summary compensation table are greater for fiscal than for fiscal in as part of the fiscal executive compensation process our performance based restricted stock award to wright with the award to vest in june the also service based restricted stock award to with the award to vest in equal on the second fourth and fifth of the grant date as condition to these wright and were to execute non competition with the of which are on page as part of his offer of employment is to bonus of with one half in march and the other half to be in march during the first two of employment is to recover this bonus if voluntarily from or is for violation of policy furthermore no bonus installment shall be if prior to the date of payment voluntarily from is as the result of violation of policy or employment is as the result of his death or disability additionally received grant of restricted stock valued at in connection with his employment with in this restricted stock grant is to vest in equal on the second and fourth of the grant date finally received certain relocation in fiscal reimbursement of certain on the sale of his home relocation allowance duplicate housing and tax gross up related to such relocation in addition our receive other generally available to our such as participation in our profit plan our stock purchase plan and other available to our such as our deferred compensation plan our also receive certain and supplemental below table of contents what financial performance metrics were applied to our compensation for fiscal the selected the following performance metrics to apply to our incentive based compensation during fiscal element of compensation fiscal performance metrics cash incentive company operating income for performance return on investment us comparable store club comparable club international revenue growth the chose these performance metrics because it that good performance relative to these metrics is important for our overall financial performance and therefore is likely to have positive effect on shareholder the that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to our to achieve performance that is in the best of our company and our the that the combination of these performance metrics to mitigate the risk that our would be to pursue good with respect to single metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if our management were to seek to increase comparable store or club by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in cash incentive what were the specific performance for fiscal and how did our company perform relative to those cash incentive payment the generally to set performance applicable to our cash incentive plan so that consistent level of difficulty in these is from year to year the applicable to the cash incentive are expressed in of percentage increase over our prior year performance as below the cash incentive of our that are responsible for one of our operating are based in part on the performance of those operating for fiscal the threshold target and maximum performance under our cash incentive plan and our actual performance are shown in the following table because operating performance for of the cash incentive plan is calculated on an as basis the actual shown in the table below differ from our operating fiscal cash incentive plan increase over fiscal goal applicable to threshold target maximum actual total company tax profit us operating income international operating income club operating income for the purpose of our cash incentive plan we define tax profit as income from before income and minority interest subject to certain necessary to compare tax profit for particular fiscal year to the prior on comparable basis we have the for fiscal below such tax profit as may be considered non financial measure under the for of the performance we define return on investment which is non measure as defined in the as operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight the definition of comparable store and comparable club for this purpose is the same as the definition used for financial and from and in the united open for the previous and in format are from comparable store when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square footage of more than five percent comparable club as calculated for this purpose exclude the fuel of our club table of contents these were established in light of the operating for our company and each of its and in light of economic in our industry and in the in which we at the time the were established in in order to achieve the target set forth above our company and operating would have to perform in line with our earnings and operating plan at the time the were set in order to achieve the maximum the performance of our company and operating would have to exceed those by significant amount the higher performance for our international division relative to our other reflected our strategic growth for our international market and the level of capital investment for growth in the international in which we operate the club reflected the impact of fuel which significantly to income in fiscal but were to have negative impact on income in fiscal in actual performance for of our cash incentive plan the made certain positive and negative to the tax profit of our total company and operating income for each of our operating as provided by the of the plan these are intended to enable for particular fiscal year to be on comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our cash incentive plan underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of our for fiscal the most significant to tax profit and operating income were to remove the impact of in currency exchange and to exclude related to in the fourth quarter other were to exclude the impact of interest expense related to share to exclude the operating income related to recent and to exclude for litigation as result of this adjustment process the fiscal in operating income shown in the table above differ from our publicly operating for fiscal under after these the fiscal performance under our cash incentive plan for our were as by company and division performance name international duke wright these each neo received the cash incentive payment shown below expressed both as percentage of base salary and fiscal cash incentive of of duke wright actual to reflect hire date in addition the an additional cash incentive payment to equal to of his target cash incentive award for fiscal or in this additional award for the considered the outstanding performance of international in environment and to that performance his in and comprehensive global strategy net billion for the first time in fiscal and international remains our growing segment international would have been even higher without the impact of lower currency exchange against the dollar international also grew its operating income faster than during fiscal table of contents portion of each cash incentive payment is also subject to meeting diversity for fiscal these of two placement and good faith under our diversity program each cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not achieve applicable diversity for the fiscal year based on the report of our chief diversity officer the determined that each neo satisfied his diversity for fiscal performance performance represent the long term performance based component of our executive compensation program performance vest only if performance over three year period are satisfied the following table the performance applicable to the performance with three year performance period ending by our and the resulting performance after to ensure that operating for fiscal are on comparable basis to the prior year against those performance period weighting performance actual performance threshold target maximum beginning with the performance as part of fiscal compensation the the performance metrics in an effort to the performance share program more closely with performance metrics that can be by our for performance with three year performance period ending and the weighting of these metrics for our for fiscal is as name return growth duke wright performance to with primary responsibility for the total company such as duke and are subject to mix of the four performance above performance to with primary responsibility for one of our operating such as messrs wright and are subject to the performance measure corresponding to their operating division along with total company return on investment this approach is consistent with our philosophy of compensating based on performance within their influence while still tying significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company as result of its review of the performance share and how well they their intended purpose beginning in fiscal the also the manner in which performance are set and measured for prior to performance were set at the beginning of the three year vesting period for the entire three year period after several of experience with performance we determined that as practical matter setting at the beginning of three year period for the entire period could result in performance that were either not realistically achievable or that could prove to be too easy to achieve in either instance performance would cease to be an effective tool in performance the performance in and in subsequent continue to have three year vesting period and continue to be based on performance over that three year period however the now the for each fiscal year within the three year performance cycle at the beginning of that fiscal year at the end of the full three year performance cycle we will calculate the average of our actual performance for each year in the three year performance period against that performance to determine whether any performance will vest and if so how many we believe that this change the the ability to set more effective performance based on more current information and over more realistic time frame table of contents the following table the performance set by the for fiscal applicable to the performance in and and our performance against those performance period performance measure performance as threshold target maximum club club international revenue growth as noted above the performance considered for of our executive compensation program is to ensure that operating for particular fiscal year are on comparable basis to the prior year and are intended to measure underlying operating performance therefore the shown above differ from our operating for fiscal for example the international revenue growth shown above is on constant dollar basis excluding the impact of in currency exchange these will be with the against performance established by the for the other two fiscal within the three year performance period to determine the ultimate for these performance what and other do our receive our receive limited number of and supplemental we cover the cost of annual physical we provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for number of each

considered among other the peer group data and analyses below our overall performance in fiscal in the context of economic environment our financial and operating performance and for those direct responsibility for the performance of one of our operating the performance of that operating division each individual performance and to our achievement of financial and operational each job historical compensation and and level of experience and the importance of retaining each neo and each potential to assume greater in the future we do not have any formula that which of these is more or less important in setting and the importance of specific may vary from neo to neo the the individual of each neo and the needs of our company when the importance of these in setting for each neo table of contents in individual performance the on annual performance and for each neo other than the on with our regarding such performance during the fiscal year in our performance the also on an evaluation of our performance by our chairman and by the chair of the and on with our chairman regarding our performance how is peer group data used by the during the compensation setting process the data in several ways first data was used to help determine the fiscal for each neo in our against at peer group the on comparative data and analyses provided to our people division by hay group to determine which at peer are most comparable to our through this process hay group at our company and at peer group and sizes each job consistent methodology to represent the relative scope and difficulty of these this in point score for each job that is intended to provide for more accurate by of similar our people division and the on these to determine those at peer group that are most comparable in of job scope and to the and job of our this data does not produce comparable at all of our peer group for all of our the also used data when each among the various of compensation as general guide to ensure that the amount of to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation against what peer do we the compensation of our our company is the retailer by wide and significantly more extensive international than most publicly based as result the that simply neo compensation against retail industry index would not provide the with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our therefore the publicly available information for three peer to determine how our compensation to the compensation to in comparable at other since information regarding comparable to those of some of our is not available for many of the in our peer three peer also in number of comparable to which our compensation could be data regarding each of these peer was by our people division based on publicly available information as vice chairman wright significant global global in addition to his as head of our us therefore we compensation against that of within our peer this in compensation at significantly lower percentile to his than our other retail industry survey this survey us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly retail with significant with annual exceeding

among the fortune by the people division the select fortune whose primary business is not but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global business model and we from this group since

the time of our for fiscal we were approximately in of annual revenue and approximately in of market capitalization than the retail industry survey at the median to take into account this discrepancy

these peer or to any particular of peer group when against them table of contents what other information does the consider when the also other information in the process of setting although the generally these to be less significant than the above compensation the also an estimate of the compensation of each of our during prior fiscal as well as of the compensation that could be by our in future the this information in order to understand the compensation actually by each neo and to determine whether such compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention no specific quantitative criteria are used in this analysis rather the this information as helpful in making subjective determination as to the appropriateness and reasonableness of each compensation and of the effectiveness of our compensation in our tally the also tally prepared by our people division these tally summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation and other the tally also quantify the that would be to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company fiscal are there any significant to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged to be comprised of base salary cash incentive opportunity and equity equity continue to be divided between performance and service based restricted stock in the established fiscal performance metrics and for the cash incentive payable under the management incentive plan for fiscal the cash incentive payable to our under this plan will be based on operating income as well as diversity as in prior the established threshold target and maximum performance under this plan the set the performance for fiscal such that our should earn approximately their target cash incentive payment if our performance is in line with our earnings as of our company must achieve near the of the range of our earnings in order to achieve maximum performance for fiscal in march the established performance metrics and for fiscal for performance by our for fiscal these will be based on return on investment and total growth for fiscal the selected total growth as the metric for corporate support and for our us and club comparable store which had been used in fiscal and fiscal this change is intended to our performance share more closely with our business strategy which productive growth appropriate leverage and return on investment the that return on investment to be the highest weighted performance metric for the performance which should help ensure that our are to grow the business productively these performance were set at which if we perform in line with our target should be achievable our company must perform at or near the of our with respect to each of these performance metrics in order to achieve maximum performance for fiscal general executive compensation what are our for stock and other equity option exercise we did not grant any stock to our during fiscal and stock are not currently part of our executive compensation program the may grant stock in the future in special when we grant stock the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the

performance of our and to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax with the exception of the portion of the cash incentive payment attributable to individual performance made to we believe that the cash incentive made to our for fiscal met these we also believe that the performance with performance period ending by our that met these do we have employment with our we do not have employment with any of our all are employed on an at will basis do we have severance with our we have into post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement that if we terminate the employment for any reason other than his violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two

country in which we have store or in which the executive we expect to have store within the near future and annual retail above certain these reduce the risk that any of our former would use the and knowledge they while with us for the benefit of one of our during reasonable period after leaving our company for more information regarding that we may be to make to our upon termination of

the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award participant any of our or otherwise detrimental to the best of our company the recipient must repay the incentive award upon

our stock only during open window and only after they have moreover may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange or or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative that speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial against the financial of our company risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share plan we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation for reward mix of different performance namely earnings based based and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share plan are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating division to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain under which may be or if the recipient not with our our statement of ethics or detrimental to the best

the district of island and over based human and every state civil advocacy group endorsed national legislation explicitly discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity our company in and to in and that currently prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity we believe that that prohibit discrimination both on the basis of sexual

company would benefit from consistent corporate wide policy to enhance to prevent discrimination resolve internally and ensure respectful and supportive atmosphere for all mart will enhance its

more than million more than million in the united our continued success as business on an inclusive work environment that the unique and of our sam our company by respect for the individual as core basic belief in keeping with this belief we serve our by an inclusive working environment through our employment in we received from national and for our to advance diversity and inclusion although the board is of the recognition that received for its in diversity and inclusion the board that the strength of diversity and inclusion not in the number of our company but in our commitment to leverage the rich mix of unique and that each of our to our company one example of our ongoing to fulfill its commitment to and the diversity of our is the creation of associate resource at our home

age disability marital status veteran status sexual orientation genetic information or any other legally status in light of our ongoing concrete to foster diverse and inclusive workplace for all of our and in view of the fact that this policy broadly discrimination or harassment based on any status by the law the board does not believe that change to our discrimination harassment prevention policy is necessary at this time for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no advisory vote on executive compensation resolved that the of mart mart or the company urge the board of to adopt policy under which could vote at each annual meeting on an advisory resolution to be by management to ratify the compensation of the executive set forth in the proxy summary compensation table the and the narrative disclosure of material provided to understand the but not the compensation discussion and analysis the proposal to should make clear that the vote is non binding and would not affect any compensation or to any neo supporting statement are increasingly concerned about executive compensation that sometimes to be insufficiently with the creation of shareholder value those have only in the current economic downturn recent sec rule which received record support from to disclose additional information about compensation and for in this rule the sec made it clear that market not the sec should provide and on compensation we believe that corporate governance sec and stock exchange listing do not give enough to provide input to on senior executive compensation by contrast public in the united kingdom allow to cast an advisory vote on the remuneration report which executive compensation such vote is not binding but clear voice that could help shape senior executive compensation table of contents stock exchange listing require shareholder approval of equity based compensation but those set only general and accord the compensation committee substantial discretion in making and performance for particular year do not have to provide ongoing feedback on the application of those general to individual pay see fried pay without performance similarly performance criteria for shareholder approval that would allow company to deduct compensation in excess of million are broad and do not constrain compensation in setting performance for particular senior from compensation committee who are standing for is blunt and inadequate instrument for dissatisfaction with the way in which the committee compensation and in the previous year accordingly we urge board to let express their opinion about senior executive compensation by an annual referendum process the of such vote would we think provide mart with useful information about whether view the senior executive compensation as each year to be in best we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no we recognize the importance of executive compensation to our and understand the importance of our executive compensation program in manner that to the highest of corporate governance after careful consideration the board does not believe that the adoption of this proposal is in the best of and that vote against this proposal for the following the which is comprised solely of independent our executive compensation as in the the in thorough and process and wide range of when designing and executive compensation the board that the is in the best position to make executive compensation and should have flexibility in making appropriate executive compensation that will attract and retain the talent necessary to achieve business we believe that the information we disclose in the and the executive compensation tables the insight to have confidence that our compensation are sound and that our are in manner that is consistent with the of our we believe that currently have the opportunity to provide feedback related to executive compensation as in the corporate governance section of this proxy statement have various and written correspondence to communicate with the entire board with the or with individual by communicating directly with the board through these can provide specific feedback regarding our executive compensation philosophy and we believe that this is much more effective and accurate method of particular or related to our executive compensation than simple for or against advisory vote which no meaningful insight regarding specific or that shareholder may have for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no political report resolved that the of mart company hereby request that the company provide report semi annually the and for political and both direct and indirect made with corporate funds monetary and non monetary political and not deductible under section of the internal revenue code but not limited to to or on behalf of political political political and other political organized and operating under sec of the table of contents internal revenue code and any portion of any or similar made to any tax exempt organization that is used for an expenditure or

political contribution or expenditure and the internal or if any governing the political and the report shall be to the board of audit committee or other relevant oversight committee and posted on the to reduce to stockholder supporting statement as long term of mart we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political these include direct and indirect political to political or political independent or on behalf of federal state or local candidate disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and its and critical for compliance with recent federal ethics legislation absent system of accountability company assets can be used for policy that may be inimical to the long term of and may pose to the company and its mart at least million in corporate funds since the election cycle home do and national institute on money in state politics index however on publicly available data does not provide complete picture of the political for example the to trade used for political are undisclosed and unknown in many even management does not know how trade use their money politically the proposal the company to disclose all of its political to trade and other tax exempt this would bring our company in line with growing number of leading and electric power that support political disclosure and accountability and present this information on their the board and its need complete disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets thus we urge your support for this critical governance reform statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political consistent with the federal state and local governing such we are fully to with all concerning political public disclosure federal law currently from making directly to for federal office and to national party as result does not make such some of our voluntarily fund political action committee pac that political to state and federal political party and or political action the of pac are subject to comprehensive regulation by the federal government detailed disclosure pac monthly of receipts and with the federal election commission the as well as election and post election all political over are shown in public information made available by the under the disclosure act of to congress semi annual which also are publicly available at the state level both and political also are subject to regulation although some have not corporate to or political all require that such be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available table of contents as result of the by law the board that ample disclosure regarding our political to alleviate the in this proposal in addition the board that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution as in this proposal would place our company at competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business and we are also involved in number of legislative that could dramatically affect our business and because with adverse also participate in the political process for their own business any unilaterally expanded disclosure by could benefit these to the detriment of and its for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no special special resolved ask our board to take the necessary unilaterally to the extent permitted by law to amend our and each appropriate governing document to give of of our outstanding common stock or the percentage permitted by law above the power to call special meeting this that multiple small can combine their to equal the above threshold this that such bylaw and or charter will not have any exception or exclusion to the extent permitted by law that apply only to but not to management and or the board and that will have no less at management special than management at shareholder special to the extent permitted by law special meeting to vote on important such as that can arise between annual if can not call special meeting investor may suffer should have the ability to call special meeting when matter prompt attention this proposal does not impact our current power to call special meeting this proposal topic also won more than support at the following in sprint mot and and nick these the merit of this special meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for in our corporate governance status the corporate library an independent investment research firm rated our company with high governance risk and very high concern for executive pay million former lee the corporate library said the more than of our total outstanding this the risk that the of us minority were to the of the especially when the two were on our board chairman with long tenure and director seven were either mart or had with mart which could compromise their independence this raised multiple regarding board independence we had no shareholder right to vote on executive pay call special meeting cumulative voting or an independent board chairman shareholder to address each of these have received majority at other and each would be an excellent topic for our next annual meeting we did not have separate board committee for executive pay or the above show there is need for improvement please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal special yes on statement in opposition to proposal no the board that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best of our company or its consistent with corporate law our provide that special meeting of may be by majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for public table of contents company of our because it our board according to its fiduciary to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best of to convene special meeting with as little as ten percent of the outstanding to call special for any reason and at any time could result in special that are not in the best of our company and all of its we take very seriously and take to provide with access to our making our available via holding special meeting of our would be costly undertaking involve substantial and require us to commit significant and attention to the legal and logistical of such meeting for example we would incur legal printing and associated with and the disclosure for special meeting the board also that our governance and provide with access to the board and of senior management and offer ample opportunity for to express their to management these governance include the annual election of all board and majority voting requirement for the election of in addition may submit shareholder which if appropriate under the may be included in our annual proxy statement and on at our annual meeting furthermore the governing listed on the and incorporated under law require us to submit certain to vote of for approval such as large share or similar and the approval of equity based compensation for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no poultry slaughter resolved that to advance the financial and the welfare of and for its encourage the board to require the chicken and turkey to switch to animal welfare friendly atmosphere killing less cruel method of slaughter within five supporting statement the current slaughter method used by many of mart poultry is cruel and inefficient consider the following many of mart poultry use electric immobilization in their this shackling live shocking them with water in stun bath cutting their and removing their in of scalding hot water often suffer broken bruising and during the shackling process which product quality and yield they also peck and scratch at each other which carcass contamination because the electric current in the stun bath is kept too low to effectively render unconscious many have their cut while they are still able to feel pain are often scalded to death in when this they often defecate further decreasing yield and increasing the likelihood of contamination frenzied flap their kick and vomit and defecate on them leading to worker and illness and poor overall is better for the welfare and more efficient consider the following with who are still in their transport are in where their oxygen is with nonpoisonous them to sleep every report on and numerous meat industry scientific temple raj and have that it is superior to electric immobilization with regard to animal welfare because there is no live shackling or live scalding product quality and yield are greatly and contamination is drastically the manager of turkey plant in told poultry that since switching to his company is starting to quantify the in yield and labor and see the in wing meat and breast meat because never handle live improve injury and illness decrease and the for to abuse live are the turnover rate at poultry plant by percent after it system table of contents the following are already moving toward king and carls give preference or consideration to chicken that use in canada ruby teeter and dixie are or by mart the ability to leverage its financial and industry power to require its to adopt this less cruel method of slaughter for poultry and move the industry in the right direction we urge to support this socially and ethically responsible resolution statement in opposition to proposal no humane animal handling by all of its we believe that atmosphere killing and other poultry and livestock merit continued study and review but that the effects of on food safety and product quality for poultry in commercial and the of to our remain unclear furthermore remains concerned that like could raise with respect to compliance with food and certain religious food preparation as result that all of poultry convert to to be premature at this time not experienced any significant customer demand that it sell only poultry that been moreover conversion of to only could be very expensive if we were to require our to convert to only within five making the conversion could seek to increase the at which they sell their to us in order to recoup the cost of the conversion some of those might decide not to continue selling to if were to require such conversion by supplier and as result for the poultry financial could be adversely affected in addition might find it difficult to replace any lost with only or who would sell poultry to at acceptable such situation could affect ability to meet customer demand for poultry remains to humane treatment of by its and that all of its conform to applicable legal and industry for the handling and of poultry and livestock we intend to continue to monitor our and available to ensure that to offer its affordable quality food however the board that implementation of requirement that all of poultry product use only in their would place at competitive disadvantage and would be contrary to the best of and its for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no report whereas primary responsibility is to create shareholder value the company should pursue legal and ethical to achieve that goal and legislative and regulatory public that would advance company and shareholder value in transparent and lawful manner resolved the request the board of at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information report to on the process for and legislative and regulatory public policy advocacy the report may describe the process by which the company and public policy of interest to the company describe the process by which the company into and trade for the purpose of affecting public policy table of contents identify and describe public policy of interest to the

of importance to the company and its embracing public policy that are contrary to the economic of who buy company or the preservation of the free enterprise system as whole shareholder value absent

company our our financial performance and the value of our stock those and relate to such varied as income tax on goods product safety environmental regulation renewable energy and interstate trucking and encompass many other and our business such public policy when and in manner the board and our management decide are appropriate and in the best of our company the board that for to pursue most effectively its own legislative and public policy and to preserve competitiveness in the the public policy of interest to the to such the for such if when and how to address those and how to enter and should not as general rule be widely the adoption and implementation of the proposal would result in public disclosure of such most if not all of in the retail industry do not issue report similar to the one the proposal if were to issue such report any strategic advantage as well as our ability to pursue our public policy effectively and without or untimely publicity regarding our could be negatively affected such effects of the report would not be in the best of our table of contents report on such would be complex and expensive undertaking an expense that in the opinion of the board would far outweigh any benefit to our further the policy affecting business often prove to be extraordinarily complex properly such policy detailed understanding of complex set of the content of pending legislation can change and dramatically and may sometimes necessitate change in our position on particular piece of legislation because of the speed and urgency with which may need to respond to public policy can not wait for the next meeting to seek guidance from its on whether or how to address such moreover which public policy are of interest to and how those are and may change frequently in response to in sum the report by the proposal not only would impose an impediment to the effective conduct of public policy but would also require an expenditure of and time that
