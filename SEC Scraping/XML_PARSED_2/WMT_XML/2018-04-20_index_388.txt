ongoing executive compensation governance and proxy statement fiscal performance metrics what financial performance metrics are used in our incentive and why did the select our performance based pay for fiscal was based on objective established financial for the following metrics financial performance metrics for of our incentive total company and international operating income and roi are calculated on constant currency basis and exclude certain such as revenue from fuel see page for more information the that the metrics above are appropriate and effective in driving tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the considered the following these performance metrics are with our enterprise strategy and can be impacted by our unlike metrics tied to stock price or shareholder return our can have direct impact on our operating income and roi furthermore unlike earnings per share and other share based metrics operating income and roi are not materially impacted by our share repurchase program these metrics are important for retail performance operating income and roi have historically been and continue to be important of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these is important to our the that success with respect to these metrics will support shareholder value over the long term the independent compensation consultant the historical correlation of various performance metrics and within the retail industry and found that the metrics used in our incentive are with in the retail industry we believe that good performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value over time it is difficult to effectively apply relative and other relative performance metrics to executive compensation program there are several key in our business to other publicly in the our our significant international our product mix and our variety of while the closely performance relative to that of our when making compensation the that the best approach for is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are with our strategy and operating and that can be directly impacted by our the combination of these performance metrics risk combination of performance metrics the risk that our could be to pursue with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if management were to increasing by that would negatively impact profitability resulting in incentive pay based on should be offset by in incentive pay based on operating income and roi proxy fiscal performance metrics what non financial metrics were used to assess the performance of our under our incentive for fiscal culture diversity and inclusion since fiscal our and many other management have had under our culture diversity and inclusion program the established these because it that diversity and inclusion contribute to an engaged and effective for fiscal our culture diversity and inclusion program included related to representation and promotion participation in diversity and inclusion and development of business specific diversity and inclusion subject to our culture diversity and inclusion program have of their annual performance evaluation tied to diversity and inclusion and can have their annual cash incentive payment reduced by up to if they violate our discrimination and harassment based on the report of our chief culture diversity and inclusion officer the determined that each neo satisfied his or her diversity for fiscal for more information about commitment to diversity and inclusion and key diversity and inclusion please see culture diversity and inclusion report which is available on our at corporate report web ethics and compliance since fiscal our executive cash incentive have also been subject to adequate progress in to the global compliance program now known as our ethics and compliance program our company is to and strong and effective global ethics and compliance program in every country in which we operate consistent with that commitment over the past few our company made significant to our ethics and compliance program around the world in early fiscal our senior leadership again for further to our global ethics and compliance program on basis covered subject such as anti corruption anti money responsible food safety environmental compliance health and safety compliance and and these sought to enhance key of our corporate ethics and compliance program but not limited to and enhanced compliance and and training of key compliance personnel and assessment of various of the program internal and access to information if in the judgment of the audit committee the company had not adequate progress in these then the could have negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the fiscal cash incentive to one or more of our executive during fiscal management regularly to the audit committee regarding ongoing to our global ethics and compliance program and progress in these at the end of fiscal the audit committee determined that in its qualitative judgment adequate progress had been in these and its determination to the on by the audit committee in making this determination included the progress on in variety of ethics and compliance and the extent to which that progress reflected sustainable long term change in the people and culture based on the qualitative assessment of the audit committee the determined not to exercise negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the cash incentive to any of our executive for fiscal for more information about specific to our global ethics and compliance program during fiscal please see letter about our global ethics and compliance program which is available on our at corporate global responsibility global compliance program report on fiscal year fiscal performance proxy statement incentive goal setting philosophy and process how does the set performance performance are established in the context of and consistent with the enterprise strategy and financial operating each fiscal year this process with the review of the overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and at an annual board strategic meeting following the strategic meeting the annual operating of the company and each of its operating are established with and board input the then performance under our annual and long term incentive that are consistent with these operating in fiscal we articulated our strategy to become the first retailer to deliver seamless shopping experience at scale we on this strategy by making significant year in our people technology and supply chain to improve our experience today while for sustainable growth in the future we also continued to focus on our global portfolio by certain and selling certain assets while also our in in we provided greater visibility into the long term of our strategy by our year financial plan at that time of our year financial plan included billion to billion in growth over three year period generating approximately billion in operating cash flow over three year period an incremental billion over two in associate wage and training several billion over three year period in lower for our as result of our strategic operating income and earnings per share were to decline during fiscal and and be relatively flat in fiscal consistent with our year financial plan in we provided specific guidance regarding earnings per share for fiscal which at that time we would remain relatively flat in march of the established operating income and roi for fiscal under our incentive consistent with our guidance for example the total company target operating income and for fiscal were as incentive metric fiscal target goal in millions change from fiscal excluding currency and fuel total company operating income total company proxy incentive goal setting philosophy and process these incentive were established with the intent that performance in line with our operating and guidance should result in approximately at target in order to achieve the maximum our performance would have to exceed our operating to significant degree threshold performance are set at level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify the independent compensation consultant annually the difficulty of our target performance and consistently found these to be why does the set each year under our long term equity incentive program the found setting each year annually for long term equity with three year vesting period is the most effective approach for our long term equity incentive program for the following as the global retailer operating are significantly impacted by and regional economic that may change drastically and that are outside of control these economic as well as the rapidly retail industry make it difficult to forecast accurately over three year period for example in fiscal our were performance with three year and roi performance subsequently the global financial downturn in had the effect of making these three year virtually unachievable only few into the three year performance period we believe that performance cease to be an effective tool in performance if the either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve due to beyond the control of our while some attempt to address the impact of by relative in their long term incentive the determined that relative are not the right approach for for the on page the regularly performance relative to and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive are operating as intended another advantage of this approach is more easily understandable and better performance which the are more effective in performance our incentive are with our enterprise strategy business plan and regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on strategic and other for example if we were to set three year this would result in situation in which our have three at any one time one for each outstanding of performance equity the that combining annual performance with three year vesting period effectively long term focus with clear and understandable performance as on page beginning with the in the simplified our long term equity program by providing for one year performance period by an additional two year time based vesting period incentive goal setting philosophy and proxy statement fiscal performance and performance what were the fiscal financial under our annual and long term incentive our performance based pay for fiscal was based on objective established financial for the following weighted metrics in order to make comparable from year to year for of our incentive total company and international operating income and roi are calculated on constant currency basis and exclude certain such as revenue from fuel how did we perform in comparison to those fiscal annual cash incentive and in millions constant currency operating income constant currency excluding fuel in order to make comparable from year to year we exclude fuel the impact of currency exchange rate and the effects of certain other from our of for incentive plan see page for more information proxy fiscal performance and performance fiscal long term performance equity and constant currency excluding fuel in millions roi in order to make comparable from year to year we exclude fuel the impact of currency exchange rate and the effects of certain other from our of for incentive plan see page for more information how were these used to determine fiscal award the performance to each of the shown above was then weighted according to each performance measure and was then with for the prior two within each three year performance cycle as below beginning with the fiscal grant our received

performance performance club total company fiscal grant segment time based vesting through performance and to vest on club based on continued employment total company fiscal performance and proxy statement why do the used in our incentive differ from our of for fiscal the objective in our incentive is to cause incentive to be calculated on comparable basis from year to year and to ensure that plan are and appropriately the rigorous oversight and certification process to determine the to exclude from our of for of our incentive this process is not outcome driven and both positive and negative to of for the above the following of are from our incentive and or our incentive by the of the incentive like many other our shareholder incentive require that incentive be calculated by excluding the impact of recent and and store and similar on our operating for fiscal by the of our incentive the majority of the difference between our and operating income and our and operating income as calculated for incentive plan at the time incentive are established when the incentive it typically the impact of certain from the performance for example because as matter of policy we generally do not hedge for currency exchange rate the incentive on pegged currency basis excluding the impact of currency exchange rate similarly that exclude the impact of fuel because fuel are volatile and subject to significant fluctuation which is out of our control also in light of our significant ongoing in when the established fiscal operating income for our operating it limited the impact of certain operating attributable to the of those operating for incentive plan in order to encourage our segment to make these necessary from are not limited for of total company incentive so that operating are calculated on comparative basis from year to year consistent with the of our incentive the may exclude certain other so that can be calculated on comparative basis from year to year during fiscal these included among the exclusion of related to unplanned bonus to our as well as an accrual related to our ongoing investigation impact of on fiscal performance for incentive plan as shown below by significant the from our fiscal of of automatically by the of our such as the impact of and and to be at the time incentive were set such as the impact of currency exchange rate fuel

performance for incentive plan roi for long term performance equity when calculating roi for long term performance equity we used the operating income shown in the table above in the row titled

compensation and risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally any that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation our performance based compensation is balanced between an annual incentive and long term incentive program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation reward performance based on mix of operating income based metrics based metrics and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance metrics any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one metric to the detriment of performance under other metrics for example our long term performance share plan is based equally on and roi performance we believe that this structure any incentive to pursue that would increase our at the detriment of roi performance the regularly the mix and of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation and that they are with our strategy and provide appropriate to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at and of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to robust stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive cash incentive are subject to reduction or elimination if compliance are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain robust under which may be or if an associate not with our our global statement of ethics or detrimental to the best of our company compensation committee and insider participation none of the who on the or the predecessor committee at any time
