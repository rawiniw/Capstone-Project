corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store table of by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both

the priority of leverage the company objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than

in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for the three and six respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year the in net were primarily due to year over year growth in retail square the impact of fiscal which for million and million of the net for the three and six respectively and positive comparable club at sam club these were partially offset by million and billion of negative impact from in currency exchange for the three and six respectively and by in comparable store at and in number of our international table of comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and six and were as three ended six ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel for the three and for the six when to the same in the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club were positively impacted by member traffic driven by various membership at sam club and negatively impacted at from lower consumer spending primarily due to the increase in the payroll tax rate additionally positively impacted the total comparable store and club approximately for each of the three and six month ended our impact those through our and through our distribution as well as an estimate for but through our and table of ended six ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three and six operating and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year accordingly we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net for either period overall lower than net higher investment in key such as global leverage and and additional related to the foreign corrupt act and compliance enhancement to us not for the three and six for and compliance enhancement were million and million for the three and six respectively to million and million for the three and six respectively higher non income also to us not for the three ended the negative leverage impact of these was partially offset by decline in incentive for the three and six operating the three and six operating income grew by and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year while net by and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year in currency exchange positively impacted operating income by million and million for the three and six respectively primarily due to the we for not operating international did not grow operating income at faster rate than net and corporate and support not to any of our for the three and six as result we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net for either period table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve month ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the impact of and an increase in capital we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the six to free cash flow of the six the decline in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of income tax and an increase in capital when to the same period in the previous fiscal year free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in six ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free

our efficient use of cash in and in providing to our in the form of stock and of cash we employ our global in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through other ongoing cash from external or both accordingly we intend with only certain limited to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash outside of the in our foreign when the income either from or through our global and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our with respect to reinvestment were to change

in these with combination of short term and long term debt we plan to refinance long term debt as they mature and may desire to obtain additional long term for other corporate our access to the commercial paper and long term debt historically provided us with adequate of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in from those in the future due to our favorable in the debt in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt with favorable interest and other will depend to significant degree on the assigned by the credit rating to our indebtedness to be at or above the level of our current at the assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long term debt were as rating poor sa aa fitch the event that the of our commercial paper or any rated series of our outstanding long term debt were or withdrawn for any reason or if the assigned to any issue of our long term debt were lower than those noted above our ability to access the debt would be adversely affected in addition in such case our cost of funds for of commercial paper and long term debt the rate of interest on any such indebtedness would be higher than our cost of funds had the of those been at or above the level of the noted above the rating agency are not to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term we consider various qualitative and quantitative we monitor the ratio of our debt to total capitalization as support for our long term at and the ratio of our debt to total
