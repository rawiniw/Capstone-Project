for the three and were as three ended with sam club total comparable in the fuel for the three when to the same period in the previous fiscal year total comparable were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher at both and sam club positively impacted comparable by approximately and for the three ended for and sam club respectively table of operate with discipline by and the efficiency of how we work we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net growing at faster rate than operating three ended in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative as percentage of net for the three operating selling general and administrative operating as percentage of net basis when to the same in the previous fiscal year as result we did not leverage primarily due to we are making in and technology as well as charge related to the pending our banking canada and related to disposal and closure which in the fourth quarter of fiscal strategic capital are more capital to store technology and supply chain and less to store and club when to prior this allocation with our of improving our customer proposition in and and digital and physical shopping the following table additional detail in millions three ended allocation of capital technology supply chain and other and and total international total capital although capital relatively flat in total how we capital varied consistent with our shift in capital allocation strategy table of we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets while roi is considered non financial measure management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the on extinguishment of debt of billion and the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve ended roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating the trailing twelve ended we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial measure numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi table of calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in the same period we had net cash provided by operating of the three and respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating was due to the timing of we free cash flow of the three which was relatively flat to the three definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in three ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our

charge related to the pending our canada banking approximately million currency partially offset these unrealized were the three primarily as result of the decrease in the market value of our

was for the three to for the same period in the previous fiscal year the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the three ended was primarily due to the tax and act of and related accounting our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as result of in our assessment of certain tax valuation in tax law of administrative the impact of discrete and the mix of earnings among our and international which are subject to statutory that are generally lower than the statutory rate consolidated net income three when to the same period in the previous fiscal year the

have historically us with significant source of liquidity our cash provided by operating with our long term debt and short term have been sufficient to fund our while us to invest in that support the long term growth of our for example to finance the recently acquisition which is subject to regulatory approval we intend to use combination of newly debt and cash on hand generally some or all of the available cash flow been used to fund the on our common stock and share we believe our of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund finance our global investment and expansion pay and fund our share for the foreseeable future net cash provided by operating ended in millions net cash provided by operating net cash provided by operating was the three and respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating was due to the timing of cash and working and cash were and respectively our working capital deficit was and respectively we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in consistent access to the capital and provided to our in the form of of cash and share we use intercompany in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash provided by domestic operating with long term debt and short term accordingly we intend with only certain to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings outside of the in our foreign as part of tax reform and act of we continue to assess the impact of the tax which can in turn impact our assertion regarding any potential future repatriation if our with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the within our foreign could be to the although any repatriation under tax could be subject to incremental we do not expect current local other or potential on future of cash outside of the to have material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or of as of and cash and cash of approximately not be freely transferable to the due to local or other net cash used in ended in millions

increase our future borrowing or impair our ability to access capital and credit on commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current short term credit could impair our ability to
