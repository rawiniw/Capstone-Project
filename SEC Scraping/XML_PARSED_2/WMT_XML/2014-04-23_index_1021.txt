its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally any that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our performance based incentive compensation generally reward mix of different performance namely operating income based based and return on investment we believe that of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our operating income resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive cash incentive are subject to reduction or elimination if certain compliance are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain

proposal upon oral or written request made to mart vice president and general counsel corporate division southwest th street the board vote against each of the following shareholder based on policy as set forth in in opposition following each shareholder proposal in our in opposition we have not to refute all of the made about in the shareholder proxy statement back to contents proposal no independent chairman resolved the of mart ask the board of to adopt policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be director who not previously as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these director shall not be considered independent if during the last three he or she was or was with company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had personal service contract with the company or its senior management was with company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or percent of its gross annual from the company had business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under sec been employed by public company at which an executive officer of the company as director had relationship of the sort above with an affiliate of the company or was spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person above the policy should be without any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if current chairman to be independent between annual shareholder compliance with the policy may be if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement we believe the board of ability to provide independent oversight of management is when the chairman of the board is not independent we believe that an independent chairman who and for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and help ensure the objective of an effective board we view the alternative of lead outside director even one with robust set of as adequate only in exceptional fully disclosed by the board into bribery and corruption at in china brazil and along with recent national labor board decision to authorize nationwide complaint against the company for of federal labor law highlight the need for enhanced oversight of corporate culture and behavior board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change the for corporate governance and performance yale school of management noted in its the board report the independent chair of interest oversight of risk the relationship between the board and as conduit for regular communication with and is logical next step in the development of an independent board we urge you to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no always strived to maintain high corporate governance in keeping with this goal and unlike most other in the fortune the board the of chairman and since as stated in our corporate governance the board policy of separating the of chairman and as under the heading board leadership structure above we believe this separation of our to focus on complex daily we also believe that separate chairman on oversight and governance the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have number of other key corporate governance in place to see that our board independently of management the following independent director since our board an independent director to serve as director the board recently expanded the of the director to include at of our non management and independent which are regularly serving as liaison between the chairman of the board and the independent the authority to call of separate of the non management and independent board meeting and board meeting related information and being available for consultation with major generally defined as those holding two percent or more of the outstanding common stock when appropriate proxy statement back to contents majority independent board currently of the incumbent of our board are independent and of the board are non management fully independent key board all of the audit committee and compensation and governance committee are independent the of these are heavily engaged in for committee no to rely on any of the governance available to under the listed company if and when such may become available to the company annual board and board committee self as by our corporate governance the board and each of the board evaluate their organization leadership structure and each year to see that the board and board are effectively our chairman more than of experience with and is well positioned to provide our with guidance advice and counsel regarding business and strategy moreover our significant ownership stake in our company unparalleled alignment with the of his fellow our have the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re our chairman and other board by wide each year we note that the proponent in its supporting statement report by the yale school of for corporate governance and performance the board the case for independent leadership in corporate north available at web law default the board final the report far from supporting this proposal significant portion of the report on the value of separating the of chair and structure that had in place for more than two moreover the report that there is no one all approach to board leadership the vast majority of of the separation of the of chair and that specific company may warrant the combination under exceptional in these most would agree that should explain to why such an alternative model best the long term of the corporation and its for example situation in which company may choose to explain rather than comply with separating the may include enterprise in which the and chair is the majority report at for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that of mart urge the board of board to adopt policy policy that will disclose annually whether in the previous fiscal year any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as result of determination that the senior executive company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the of or detrimental to for of this proposal senior executive former senior executive the policy should provide that the general of the recoupment or forfeiture will be the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind above in the previous fiscal year statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture by law or regulation supporting statement as long term we believe that compensation should promote sustainable value creation we believe disclosure of the application of recoupment forfeiture would encourage ethical conduct and appropriate risk management at by senior about behavioral while discouraging future costly compliance by communicating concrete for misconduct in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon finding of misconduct management incentive plan that the compensation and governance committee committee may recoup all incentive compensation whether or not previously or deferred in the previous if the committee that the recipient engaged in any act inimical to the best of or to comply with and similarly the stock incentive plan sip for forfeiture of outstanding and repayment of received in respect of certain plan in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to best sip section separation with several recently retired senior state that may suspend and recoup made under any agreement with the executive if failure on the part to abide by statement of ethics is discovered proxy statement back to contents never disclosed whether these recoupment forfeiture have been applied making it difficult for to hold of the committee accountable for the as of million in associated with into foreign corrupt act in china and brazil and also recently pled guilty to federal and state criminal and civil of illegally dumping hazardous leading to over million in cab aa recoupment disclosure would allow to determine whether compensation from any current or former senior executive for similar misconduct statement in opposition to proposal no the board that vote against this proposal because sec disclosure already require sufficient regarding comprehensive recoupment and the board and our management believe that compensation should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation offer and other numerous and that give us broad to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to or former who have engaged in misconduct we believe that these recoupment are than those provided to the and management of many and reflect strong commitment to ethics and integrity broad recoupment include the following our management incentive plan that participant must have with our statement of ethics at all in order to be eligible to receive cash incentive payment moreover participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the within twelve of its payment that prior to the payment the participant any of our or otherwise inimical to the best of our company our stock incentive plan that if the that an associate any act detrimental to the best of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised and unvested of restricted stock and performance the stock incentive plan additionally that participant must reimburse the company if the that the participant at any time up to one year after the receipt of an equity award any of our any restrictive or confidentiality or otherwise inimical to the best of our company when an executive officer leaves we generally enter into separation agreement that he associate that the associate with the applicable statement of ethics during the employment the discovery of failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle to suspend and recoup any or due under this agreement or any other between the our statement of ethics among other all from being dishonest acting illegally and between the work and personal and the board are to recoupment against current and former to have unethically we already are by sec disclosure to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation been and the amount from our moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation and compensation regarding the we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be further to disclose information taking into account applicable legal the desire of to receive information confidentiality and commercial and other are properly made on case by case basis report would deprive the board of the ability to exercise judgment and discretion with respect to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information as noted above the disclosure already require to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive who during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such meet the definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure to all current and former senior is warranted in addition recoupment of compensation is not the only sanction that may impose on who violate company or otherwise act contrary to the best of our company for example an misconduct may result in his or her immediate termination from the company thus the report by the proponent which would focus solely on recoupment or forfeiture of incentive or stock compensation could present an incomplete and misleading picture of the full range of the and to penalize and deter associate misconduct in sum the board that this proposal is unnecessary because sec disclosure already require sufficient regarding comprehensive recoupment and and because the report by the proposal would not include the full range of used by to address associate misconduct for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no request for annual report on whereas corporate our company to that could adversely affect the stated and ultimately shareholder value and whereas we rely on the information provided by our company and therefore have strong interest in full disclosure of our to evaluate whether it is consistent with our expressed and in the best of and long term value resolved the of mart request the board authorize the preparation of report annually company policy and governing both direct and indirect and by used for direct or indirect or in each case the amount of the payment and the recipient membership in and to any tax exempt organization that and model legislation description of and the decision making process and oversight for making in section and above for of this proposal communication is communication directed to the general public that to specific legislation or regulation

organization of which is member both direct and indirect and include at the local state and federal the report shall be to the audit committee or other relevant oversight and posted on supporting statement as we encourage transparency and accountability in our use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation is reportedly member of the chamber of commerce which is as by far the most muscular business lobby group in chamber of economist spending more than billion on since experienced negative press because of its involvement with the chamber that actively against the foreign corrupt act mart took part in campaign to amend anti bribery law post does not disclose its in or to trade or the of such used for transparent would reveal whether company assets are being used for contrary to long term spent approximately million in and on direct federal the federal figure does not include to influence legislation in at the state level with at least in in national institute on money in state politics and does not disclose its membership in tax exempt that write and endorse model legislation we urge support for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no the board that vote against this proposal already information about its and the oversight role by the board as by law and the additional of proprietary and confidential information by this proposal are unnecessary and would risk at competitive disadvantage our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state we engage with public at the federal state and local when we believe it will serve the best of and our is to in the political process as good corporate citizen in this regard effective for the appropriate disclosure and oversight of its and is fully to with all concerning public disclosure and the decision making process to such are subject to review and oversight as in our global responsibility report our statement regarding political and policy engagement available at corporate global responsibility report political and public policy global responsibility report the and governing as reflected in that statement and in the charter of the which is composed only of independent proxy statement back to contents the review and oversight responsibility for legislative and public policy engagement strategy in addition our government policy available at corporate government policy that all and other with government or legislative on behalf of only be made by or as specifically directed by the government department this policy further that corporate funds may not be given to political or without the express knowledge and consent of the government department also with all federal and state governing its under the disclosure act of as quarterly to congress which outline federal for the quarter and the specific legislative that were the of and the who on behalf of these are available at house and senate we also provide links to these publicly available on our corporate at corporate government policy similar periodic with state reflecting state which are also publicly available like most major is member of certain retail industry and other trade that we believe can assist in its long term strategic periodically its in these which may sometimes take on legislation or communicate with government on public policy although is not the primary purpose of these the membership by and other may be part of the funds they use to engage in may not agree with every action taken by such accordingly the board that additional regarding the specific made to these trade would not necessarily present an accurate reflection of on certain public policy as result of the already review and oversight role and regarding its and the board this proposal is unnecessary in addition the board this proposal is not in the best of and our we are involved in number of legislative that could dramatically affect our business and because with adverse also lobby for their own business any unilaterally expanded disclosure by regarding its could benefit these to the detriment of and its for the above the board that the vote against this proposal other our
