how does shareholder feedback impact executive compensation our board actively and feedback from over the past several in addition to our day to day with we have expanded our shareholder engagement to include an annual outreach program on strategy governance executive compensation and other by our since our annual meeting we our institutional to participate in this outreach program and we ultimately engaged with approximately million or approximately of our public float we also had with the leading proxy advisory say on pay support this engagement gave us an opportunity to discuss our strategy our commitment to corporate governance and executive compensation best how our governance and compensation help to support our strategy and our commitment to and value while our expressed wide range of in these we received generally positive feedback on our strategy our to our board and committee structure over the past few to support that strategy our executive compensation program and recent to our proxy statement additionally our say on pay proposal received support the feedback we have received from our the of our say on pay proposal is regularly to the the and the board we

performance equity for of our incentive total company and international operating income and roi are calculated on constant currency basis and exclude certain such as revenue from fuel see page for more information the that the metrics above are with our enterprise strategy and appropriate and effective in driving tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the considered the following these performance metrics are with our enterprise strategy and can be impacted by our unlike metrics tied to stock price or shareholder return our can have direct impact on our operating income and roi furthermore unlike earnings per share and other share based metrics operating income and roi are not materially impacted by our share repurchase program these metrics are important for retail performance operating income and roi historically have been and continue to be important of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these is important to our the that success with respect to these metrics will support shareholder value over the long term the independent compensation consultant the historical correlation of various performance metrics and within the retail industry and found that the metrics used in our incentive generally are with performance over time additionally our historical performance with respect to these metrics generally correlated with our stock price over the long term we believe that strong performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value creation over time the that relative and other relative performance metrics are not the best way to our there are several key in our business to other publicly in the our our significant international our product mix and our variety of while the closely performance relative to that of our when making compensation the that the best approach for is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are with our strategy and operating and that can be directly impacted by our the combination of these performance metrics risk combination of performance metrics the risk that our could be to pursue with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if management were to increasing by that would negatively impact profitability resulting in incentive pay based on should be offset by in incentive pay

consistent with the enterprise strategy financial operating and financial guidance each fiscal year this process with the review of the overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and at an annual board strategic meeting following the strategic meeting the annual operating of the company and each of its operating are established with and board input the then performance under our annual and long term incentive that are consistent with these operating incentive informed by strategic and financial process long range annual operating incentive march assess competitive landscape and macro refine enterprise strategy and segment specific develop annual operating plan in light of long range and strategic review strategy and capital review choice of incentive metrics to ensure that they support enterprise strategy establish performance with annual operating plan and guidance in fiscal we articulated our strategy to become the first retailer to deliver seamless shopping experience at scale we on this strategy by making significant year in our people technology and supply chain to improve our experience today while for sustainable growth in the future we also continued to focus on our global portfolio by certain and selling certain assets while also our in our technology and in late fiscal we provided greater visibility into the long term of our strategy by our year financial plan at that time of our year financial plan included billion to billion in growth over three year period generating approximately billion in operating cash flow over three year period an incremental billion over two in associate wage and training and several billion over three year period in lower for our as result of our strategic operating income and earnings per share were to decline in the short term consistent with our long term financial plan in we provided specific guidance regarding earnings per share for fiscal which we would be between and per share in march of the established operating income and roi for fiscal under our incentive consistent with our guidance for example the total company target operating income and for fiscal were as incentive metric fiscal target goal in millions change from fiscal excluding currency fuel club tobacco and total company operating income total company proxy statement table of contents executive compensation these incentive were established with the intent that performance in line with our operating and guidance should result in approximately at target in order to achieve the maximum our performance would have to exceed our operating to significant degree threshold performance are set at level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify the independent compensation consultant annually the difficulty of our target performance and consistently found these to be additionally over the past ten under both our annual and long term incentive our performance target incentive in five and fallen short of target incentive in five we believe this is further evidence of the effectiveness of our goal setting process in performance that are appropriately why does the set each year under our long term equity incentive program the found that setting long term equity performance each year with three year vesting period is the most effective approach for our long term equity incentive program for the following as the global retailer operating are significantly impacted by and regional economic that may change drastically and that are outside of control these economic the rapidly retail industry and our own ongoing strategic transformation make it difficult to forecast accurately over three year period we believe that performance cease to be an effective tool in performance if the either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve due to beyond the control of our or due to in our strategy and related while some attempt to address the impact of by relative in their long term incentive the determined that relative are not the right approach for for the on page the regularly performance relative to and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive are operating as intended another advantage of this approach is that it is more easily understandable and in performance that are better with our strategic transformation the this approach is more effective in performance our incentive are with our enterprise strategy business plan and regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on strategic and other for example if we were to set three year this would result in situation in which our have three at any one time one for each outstanding of performance equity we believe this approach would potentially be and undermine the effectiveness of our performance equity program the that combining annual performance with three year vesting period effectively long term focus with clear and understandable performance beginning with the in the simplified our long term equity program by providing for one year performance period by an additional two year time based vesting period table of contents executive compensation fiscal performance and performance what were the fiscal financial under our annual and long term incentive our performance

compensation reward performance based on mix of operating income based metrics based metrics and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance metrics any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one metric to the detriment of performance under other metrics for example our long term performance share plan is based equally on and roi performance we believe that this structure any incentive to pursue that would increase our at the detriment of roi performance the regularly the mix and of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation and that they are with our strategy and provide appropriate to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at and of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to robust stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive cash incentive are subject to reduction or elimination if compliance are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain robust

accepted best practice that we believe more overall effective board of additionally our current corporate governance and already provide meaningful for to promote director accountability at like many other each share is to one vote for each director nominee in uncontested director like the one in this proxy statement are by an affirmative majority of the cast in where there are more director than there are director available our are by an affirmative plurality of the cast cumulative voting could result in the election of director interested in only the special of small group of rather than all our we believe the of cumulative voting can weaken the ability of board of to work together productively which is essential to the successful of any board of therefore the of cumulative voting could be detrimental to the effective of the board the board our current majority voting standard which is widely considered best practice and is widely and commonly applied among most and fortune in
