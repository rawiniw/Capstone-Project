assist in understanding our financial the in certain key in those financial from year to year and the primary that for those we also discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess our performance the discussion also information about the financial of the various of our business to provide better understanding of how those and their affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole our comprise three business international and club as part of an operational realignment our from the international segment to the and club the segment now the mass merchant concept in the united and operating primarily under the or mart as well as the international segment now of the outside of the united and the club segment now the warehouse membership in the united and as well as the under the caption other in the table below to operating income are corporate overhead throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store the company the of its among other each operating income that certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the segment operating income for each segment affected by the is for all to maintain comparability comparable store is measure which the performance of our by measuring the growth in for such for particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store from and open for the previous and in format are from comparable store when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square footage of more than five percent comparable store are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in of our consolidated and the operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to convert the international operating from local into for the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not in the second quarter of fiscal the company financial system in the first stage of the financial system implementation was in our subsidiary the second stage of implementation in the united and canada on may in connection with the second stage of the implementation and with the available in our financial we plan to revise our methodology for inventory under the retail method of accounting this will better the accounting for inventory with how the business is by measuring inventory at more granular level this change would be effective may and reflected in the financial in the second quarter and for all prior this change in accounting is not to have material effect on the financial condition or of company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase our operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently the company our assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net three ended dollar in millions net net international club net our net for the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal the increase in net is primarily due to our continued global expansion as we added of additional retail square footage to the first quarter of in addition billion of the increase in net was due to currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the international net in the future comparable store club total club comparable club include fuel fuel had positive impact of percentage for the three ended fuel had negative impact of percentage for the three ended fuel had positive impact of percentage for the three ended fuel had negative impact of percentage for the three ended comparable store in the united fuel for the first quarter of fiscal to an increase of for the first quarter of fiscal the increase in comparable during the first quarter of fiscal is primarily due to higher fuel which have by approximately over the same period in the prior year this increase in fuel was partially offset by reduction in customer traffic at certain near with in the rate of unemployment gasoline deflation in certain merchandise and competitive activity leverage three ended dollar in millions international club other total operating income we believe growing operating income at faster rate than net growth is meaningful measure because it how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net operating for the first quarter of fiscal operating when to the prior year while net over the same period operating grew at rate than net primarily due to labor productivity and organizational at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our operating income for the first quarter of fiscal we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net our operating income for the first quarter of fiscal grew by when to the prior year while net by over the same period all of our operating met this objective primarily due to labor productivity and organizational at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was and for the trailing month ended and respectively the period over period increase in roi is principally due to the improvement in operating income the timing of our acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of wage and hour class action in we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure under the we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its roi before our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we ended the quarter with negative free cash flow of billion and positive free cash flow of million for the three ended and respectively the first quarters decrease in free cash flow is primarily the result of an investment in inventory free cash flow is considered non financial measure under the management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the three ended and as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash provided by used in in those in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by used in of the following discussion of our of is based on our and any or discussion of our consolidated percentage in millions in our consolidated net and for the first quarter of fiscal and fiscal respectively the increase in fiscal primarily from our continued global expansion as we added of additional retail square footage to the first quarter of in addition billion of the increase in net was due to currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the international net in the future our gross profit as percentage of net gross profit was for the first quarter of fiscal which is comparable to the gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal operating as percentage of net were and for the first quarter of fiscal and respectively this decrease is primarily due to labor productivity and organizational at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our our effective income tax rate was for the first quarter of fiscal which was comparable with the effective tax rate for the same period in the prior year we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be approximately to significant that may impact the annual effective tax rate include in our assessment of certain tax and the mix of earnings among our and international as result of the above we billion and billion of income from for the fiscal quarters ended and respectively segment in millions in net for the segment for the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal the increase primarily from our continued expansion partially offset by decline in comparable store comparable store for the first quarter of fiscal due to decline in customer traffic at certain near with in the rate of unemployment gasoline deflation in certain merchandise and competitive activity gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal operating as percentage of segment net for the first quarter of fiscal were comparable with the first quarter of fiscal as result of the above segment operating income was billion for the first quarter of fiscal as to billion for the same period in the prior year international segment in millions in net for the international segment for the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal the increase primarily from store growth and the inclusion of the operating of for only two in the first quarter of fiscal additionally in currency exchange provided favorable impact of billion to the international net gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal operating as percentage of segment net for the first quarter of fiscal were comparable with the first quarter of fiscal operating income for the first quarter of fiscal experienced an increase of million due to currency rate volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the operating of the international segment as result of the above segment operating income was billion for the first quarter of fiscal to million for the first quarter of fiscal club segment percentage in millions in net for the club segment for the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal the increase was primarily due to significantly higher fuel this year to last year comparable club which in the first quarter of fiscal were positively impacted by percentage due to the increase in fuel the remainder of the comparable club increase was primarily driven by continued strength in the fresh and health and wellness as well as improving in discretionary such as home apparel and jewelry gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal operating as percentage of segment net percentage for the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal primarily due to labor productivity expense management in and maintenance and the impact of fuel on total membership and other income as percentage of segment net for the first quarter of fiscal was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal membership income which is over the

in net cash provided by used in cash provided by operating cash provided by operating were billion and billion for the first quarters of fiscal and respectively the decrease in cash provided by
