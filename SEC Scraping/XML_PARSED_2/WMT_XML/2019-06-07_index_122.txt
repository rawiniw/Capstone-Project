capital expenditure detail provided in the following table in millions three ended allocation of capital technology supply chain and other and and total international total capital we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets while roi is considered non financial measure management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with possible short term was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve primarily resulting from the billion net loss in fiscal related to the sale of the majority stake in brazil and net unrealized on our investment roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the increase in roi was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve primarily as result of lapping the and impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the denominator relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition was primarily offset by the decrease in average capital resulting from the removal of the eight rent factor upon adoption of as operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets table of define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period upon adoption of rent for the trailing by factor of is no longer included in the calculation of roi on prospective basis as operating lease assets are now for fiscal lease related assets and associated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date rather than because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing by factor of two point average will be used for assets beginning in fiscal after one full year from the date of adoption of the lease standard further beginning prospectively in fiscal rent expense in the numerator short term and variable lease as these are not included in the operating lease right of use asset balance prior to adoption of we defined roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we considered average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of which the hypothetical capitalization of our operating because the lease standard was adopted under the retrospective approach as of our calculation of roi for the comparable fiscal period was not our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial measure numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi table of calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets assets net assets without assets net depreciation and amortization amortization on assets depreciation and amortization without assets payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by average total assets as used in the average impact of the adoption of for the twelve ended as result of average total assets is based on the average of total assets without assets net plus assets net as of average depreciation and amortization is based on the average of depreciation and amortization without assets plus amortization on assets as of not provided table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating of the three which declined when to the three primarily due to an increase in inventory related to accelerated in certain the timing of sell through for summer seasonal merchandise and fulfillment as well as the timing of we free cash flow of the three which declined to the three ended due to the same as the decline in net cash provided by operating as well as billion in capital definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash
