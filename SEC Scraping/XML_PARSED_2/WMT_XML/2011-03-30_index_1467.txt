note in the to consolidated financial we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial the in certain key in those financial from year to year and the primary that for those as well as how certain accounting affect our financial we also discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess our performance the discussion also information about the financial of the various of our business to provide better understanding of how those and their affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial as of and the fiscal year then ended and currently our consist of three reportable business the segment the international segment and the club segment the segment the mass merchant concept in the united and operating under the or mart brand as well as the international segment of the outside of the united and the club segment the warehouse membership in the united and as well as throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store and club the company the of its among other each operating income certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the other in the leverage discussion of the company performance metrics are corporate overhead comparable store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store from and open for the previous and in format continue to be from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square of more than five percent since the impact of this revision is inconsequential the company will not restate comparable store and club for previously comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in of our consolidated and the operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to convert the international operating from local into for financial the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not in the dollar in connection with the financial system implementation we the level at which we apply the retail method of accounting for inventory the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable see to consolidated financial note accounting change in addition we certain revenue and expense within our consolidated of income for financial the did not impact consolidated operating income or consolidated net income attributable to all prior period have been to conform to the current presentation the retail industry we operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the we serve we face strong competition from other discount department drug variety and specialty warehouse and many of which are national regional or international as well as based and we compete with number of for prime retail site as well as in and retaining quality whom we call we along with other retail are by number of but not limited to general economic cost of goods consumer disposable income consumer debt and consumer credit availability interest customer unemployment labor inflation deflation currency exchange fuel and energy weather climate change catastrophic competitive and insurance further information on certain to our company can be in item risk in our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on through comparable store and club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets as reflected in its return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital as reflected in its free cash flow growth net fiscal ended dollar in millions net net net international club net our consolidated net by and in fiscal and fiscal respectively when to the previous fiscal year net in fiscal primarily due to our continued expansion as we added of additional retail square during fiscal in addition foreign currency exchange favorably impacted our fiscal growth by approximately billion offset by decline in total comparable store and club net in fiscal due to customer traffic continued global expansion and the acquisition of our subsidiary de in offset primarily by billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact in our international segment and adversely affected by price deflation in certain merchandise in our segment volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future calendar comparable store and club comparable store and club is measure which the performance of our and by measuring the growth in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year comparable store and club fuel impact for the fiscal ended and are as with fuel fuel impact club total comparable store and club in the fuel and in fiscal and respectively and in fiscal total comparable store and club during fiscal primarily due to decline in customer traffic although customer traffic in fiscal comparable store in the united were lower than those in fiscal due to deflation in certain merchandise and lower fuel as we continue to add in the united we do so with an understanding that additional may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store as result of opening was approximately in fiscal in fiscal and in fiscal leverage operating income fiscal ended dollar in millions international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net operating for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating at rate than net our operating in fiscal when to fiscal while net during fiscal when to fiscal operating grew at rate than net due to labor productivity and organizational made at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our as well as reduction regarding certain incentive plan in fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net our fiscal operating when to fiscal while net over the same period operating grew at faster rate than net due to higher health benefit and higher advertising operating income we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net in each of the last two fiscal in fiscal our operating income by when to fiscal while net by over the same period in fiscal our operating income by in fiscal when to fiscal while net by over the prior year our and international met this objective in fiscal our club segment fell short of this objective primarily due to million tax charge to of its the closure of return on investment management that return on investment is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with any possible short term roi was relatively stable at percent and percent for the fiscal ended and respectively we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its roi before our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as for the fiscal dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data as as total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the consolidated balance of million million and million respectively effective may the company financial system for its in the united canada and concurrent with this implementation and the system the company the level at which it the retail method of accounting for inventory in these from to see to consolidated financial note accounting change free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we positive free cash flow of billion billion and billion for the ended and respectively the decline in free cash flow during fiscal as to fiscal is principally due to our investment in inventory partially offset by an increase in payable the increase in free cash flow in fiscal as to fiscal primarily from operating and relatively low inventory at free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire statement of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in of the following discussion of our of is based on our and any or discussion of our certain that impacted our income from during the fiscal
