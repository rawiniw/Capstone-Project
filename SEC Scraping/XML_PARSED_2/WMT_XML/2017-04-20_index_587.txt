information is only one factor in the decision making process the independent compensation consultant done statistical analysis of our target and found that on basis our target are near the median of comparable within our peer see for more information regarding how our with our peer executive compensation process and proxy statement retail industry survey this peer group the to compare our neo

appropriately competitive compensation consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation the did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative to any of these peer or to any particular of peer group when against them while the data is generally used for comparable the also peer group data for retail for of the compensation of our who lead our operating these have significant and lead that considered separately from the rest of our company are than many of the other in the retail peer group and we believe that these are often comparable to or carry greater than at many of our peer group in addition from competitive standpoint we believe that it is more likely that these would be for position in the retail industry or elsewhere rather than for lateral move to lead an operating segment of company therefore the also these compensation against the compensation of within our retail peer group what other information does the consider when setting executive pay pay and performance alignment the an assessment by pay governance regarding the alignment of our pay with our performance the appropriateness of our pay opportunity to and the alignment of our realizable pay and our performance relative to our peer group pay governance that on basis our fiscal pay opportunity and realizable pay are with relative performance tally the also tally prepared by our global people division these tally summarize the total value of the compensation realizable by each neo for the upcoming fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation and other the tally also quantify the that would be to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company shareholder feedback our have expressed support for our executive compensation program at each of our last six annual the considered that support as well as other feedback from our when designing our executive compensation program and our compensation for fiscal proxy executive compensation process and governance incentive goal setting philosophy and process how does the set performance performance are established in the context of and consistent with the enterprise strategy and financial operating each fiscal year this process with the review of the overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and at an annual board strategic meeting following the strategic meeting the annual operating of the company and each of its operating are established with and board input the then performance under our annual and long term incentive that are consistent with these operating long range assess competitive landscape and macro refine enterprise strategy and segment specific develop annual operating plan in light of long range and strategic investor conference review strategy and capital review choice of incentive metrics to ensure that they support enterprise strategy establish performance with annual operating plan annual operating plan incentive march incentive with strategic and financial process in fiscal we articulated our strategy to become the first retailer to deliver seamless shopping experience at scale we on this strategy by making significant year in our people technology and commerce supply chain to improve our experience today while for sustainable growth in the future we also continued to focus on our global portfolio by certain and selling certain assets while also our in commerce commerce in we provided greater visibility into the long term of our strategy by our year financial plan at that time of our year financial plan included billion to billion in growth over three year period generating approximately billion in operating cash flow over three year period an incremental billion over two in associate wage and training several billion over three year period in lower for our as result of our strategic operating income and earnings per share were to decline during fiscal incentive goal setting philosophy and proxy statement consistent with our year financial plan in we provided specific fiscal guidance regarding earnings per share which at that time we would decrease between and and net growth which we would be relatively flat in march of the established operating income and roi for fiscal under our incentive consistent with this guidance for example the total company target operating income and for fiscal were as incentive metric fiscal target goal in millions change from fiscal excluding currency and fuel total company total company operating income these incentive were established with the intent that performance in line with our operating and guidance should result in approximately at target in order to achieve the maximum our performance would have to exceed our operating to significant degree threshold performance are set at level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify the independent compensation consultant annually the difficulty of our target performance and consistently found these to be why does the set each year under our long term equity incentive program the found setting annually for long term equity with three year vesting period is the most effective approach for our long term equity incentive program for the following as the global retailer operating are significantly impacted by and regional economic that may change drastically and that are outside of control these economic as well as the rapidly retail industry make it difficult to forecast accurately over three year period for example in fiscal our were performance with three year and roi performance subsequently the global financial downturn in had the effect of making these three year virtually unachievable only few into the three year performance period we believe that performance cease to be an effective tool in performance if the either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve due to beyond the control of our while some attempt to address the impact of by relative in their long term incentive the determined that relative are not the right approach for for the on page the regularly performance relative to and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive are operating as intended another advantage of this approach is more easily understandable and better performance which the are more effective in performance as above our incentive are with our enterprise strategy business plan and regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on strategic and other for example if we were to set three year this would result in situation in which our have three at any one time one for each outstanding of performance equity the that combining annual performance with three year vesting period effectively long term focus with clear and understandable performance as on page beginning with the in the further simplified our long term equity program by providing for one year performance period by an additional two year time based vesting period proxy incentive goal setting philosophy and process fiscal performance metrics what financial performance metrics are used in our incentive and why did the select these metrics our performance based pay for fiscal was based on objective established financial for the following metrics financial performance metrics operating income total company and or divisional total company and or divisional long roi total company total company and or divisional for of our incentive total company and international operating income and roi are calculated on constant currency basis and exclude certain such as revenue from fuel see for more information the that the metrics above are appropriate and effective in driving tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the considered the following these performance metrics are with our strategy and can be impacted by our unlike metrics tied to stock price or shareholder return our can have direct impact on our operating income and roi furthermore unlike earnings per share and other share based metrics operating income and roi are not materially impacted by our share repurchase program these metrics are important for retail performance operating income and roi have historically been and continue to be important of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these is important to our the that success with respect to these metrics will support shareholder value over the long term the independent compensation consultant the historical correlation of various performance metrics and within the retail industry and found that the metrics used in our incentive are with in the retail industry we believe that good performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value over time it is difficult to effectively apply relative and other relative performance metrics to executive compensation program there are several key in our business to other publicly in the our our significant international our product mix and our variety of while the closely performance relative to that of our when making compensation the that the best approach for is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are with our strategy and operating and that can be directly impacted by our the combination of these performance metrics risk combination of performance metrics the risk that our could be to pursue with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if management were to increasing by that would negatively impact profitability resulting in incentive pay based on should be offset by in incentive pay based on operating income and roi fiscal performance proxy statement what non financial metrics were our subject to under our incentive for fiscal culture diversity and inclusion since fiscal our and many other management have had under our culture diversity and inclusion program the established these because it that diversity and inclusion contribute to an engaged and effective for fiscal our culture diversity and inclusion program included related to representation and promotion participation in diversity and inclusion and development of business specific diversity and inclusion subject to our culture diversity and inclusion

compliance personnel and assessment of various of the program internal and access to information if in the judgment of the audit committee the company had not adequate progress in these then the could have negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the fiscal cash incentive to one or more of our executive during fiscal management regularly to the audit committee regarding ongoing to our global ethics and compliance program and progress in these at the end of fiscal the audit committee determined that in its qualitative judgment adequate progress had been in these and its determination to

the to the board that the be included in this proxy statement the this report steven wolf chair risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally any that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation our performance based compensation is balanced between an annual incentive and long term incentive program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation reward performance based on mix of operating income based metrics based metrics and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance metrics any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one metric to the detriment of performance under other metrics for example our long term performance share plan is based equally on and roi performance we believe that this structure any incentive to pursue that would increase our at the detriment of roi performance the regularly the mix and of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation and that they are with our strategy and provide appropriate to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation proxy other compensation and maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at and of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to robust stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive cash incentive are subject to reduction or elimination if compliance are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain robust under which may be or if an associate not with our our global statement of ethics or detrimental to the best of our company compensation

york comptroller in the vast majority were withdrawn when agreed to adopt similar version of proxy access in addition to public pension fund support at an sec investor advisory committee meeting representative from the asset manager in the world stated the firm proxy access as fundamental right generally on consistent with the sec rule sent letter to its that they adopt proxy access consistent with the ownership threshold included in the sec rule please vote to enhance shareholder value shareholder proxy access proposal proxy statement in opposition to proposal no remains to quality shareholder engagement because it the board to understand and consider the of our during fiscal we to have with nearly all of our institutional and with approximately half of those as well as leading proxy advisory during these we of interest to our governance management the about the feedback received during these ongoing and the of interest raised by our we recognize that proxy access is topic of interest to of the investment community who share sincere interest in the appropriate composition of company however we do not believe the adoption of this proposal is the right approach for the is comprised entirely of independent non management and it currently is by our lead independent director among its are to regularly review the composition of the board and board and evaluate the and of our current board throughout the year the in ongoing and extensive board succession the also advice and input from prominent director search consultant firm this ongoing process is designed to identify and nominate director who possess diverse and complementary mix of and professional experience necessary to oversee our complex global business and who can contribute to the overall effectiveness of our board it also the and the board to evaluate the thoughtful and timely periodic refreshment of the composition of the board as above and in this proxy statement we solicited feedback from institutional on number of governance in light of those and the composition of our shareholder base we believe the proposal too easily aside the notion that proxy access can interrupt and undermine the role of the to guide this critical governance process while our ultimately might reject director candidate in board election process which can be at virtually no cost to shareholder the resulting cost to our company and disruption for the the board and management would be meaningful and therefore would not be in our short or long term furthermore already have the ability to recommend director by of the in our governance and in this proxy statement each director candidate by shareholder pursuant to this process is to the and the all shareholder director on the same basis as all other director over the our board variety of progressive governance which provide an appropriate balance between the accountability to and the board to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for the long term benefit of all for example the compensation and governance committee been converted into two distinct board comprised entirely of independent the currently is by our lead independent director each member of the board is annually and for one year term currently the majority of our board is independent and only member of the board is member of management board have full access to the and outside the independent annually appoint the lead independent director who extensive and comprehensive and holding or more of outstanding may request special and there are no voting for for shareholder vote therefore the board our corporate governance and the employed by the for the nomination and election of have led to board that is responsive to shareholder input and is conducive to long term value creation against for the above the board that the vote against this proposal shareholder proxy statement proposal no request for independent director with environmental environmental is critical to the success of fortune generally and specifically global supply chain massive shipping and surface transportation operation network and of have an enormous environmental impact increasingly host country and and affected are on how to effectively track manage and reduce the environmental impact of economic inability to demonstrate that and are in line with internationally accepted environmental can lead to in expanding into raising capital and public goodwill and favorable reputation with much of the public image on range of environmental but these often operating without independent third party verification have been widely as inadequate the sierra club the and one of the most prominent environmental recently its that carbon pollution was increasing while the company millions of into misleading campaign around as the of climate change have become increasingly clear and concern grown about the impact of coal based energy production another report found that in of coal to power its and distribution we believe that would benefit by the environmental impact of its business at the most strategic level by an environmental specialist for election to the board an authoritative figure with acknowledged and standing could allow to more effectively address the environmental inherent in business of the and reach therefore be it resolved request that management nominate at least one candidate for election to the board at the next annual meeting of who high level of and experience in environmental relevant to global supply transportation or energy efficiency and is widely in the business and environmental as an authority in such field as reasonably determined by the board or the and governance committee and will qualify subject to in extraordinary explicitly by the board as an independent director under the definition to its provided however that no director shall be considered independent if he or she had financial relationship with an organization that received in any year in the previous three more than from majority member of the or the foundation the nomination should be made in manner that does not affect the unexpired term of any director climate institute for local self reliance dirty energy secret proxy statement in opposition to proposal no we believe that being an efficient and profitable business and being good steward of the environment can be accomplished together nearly ago our company established three to create zero waste operate with renewable energy and sell that sustain and the environment we have our numerous and progress toward these over the since as early as and each of these is available at corporate global responsibility global responsibility report archive during this time we have worked to increase the clarity and transparency of these our global responsibility report extensively how we work in the and around the world to make renewable energy work financially and and our global responsibility report will continue this tradition in we and an reduction plan that is in line with the agreement on climate change and is the first such plan by retailer to have its by the science based initiative partnership between formerly known as the carbon disclosure project the global compact institute and to help determine how much they must cut to prevent the worst of climate change the technical director of non profit that global disclosure for and governmental to manage their environmental reduction plan as game changer see science based target game changer for management provided regular about our and progress to the its predecessor board committee which is comprised entirely of independent and responsibility for and management regarding the social community and the also responsibility for actively seeking potential director who are qualified to become board the criteria set forth in our corporate governance input from the board evaluation process and the future needs of our board and board ultimately when potential candidate the and the board consider the different and that candidate could bring to the board and how those and could enhance the execution of its in providing guidance and counsel to management as in this proxy statement the in rigorous and dynamic process for and potential and to the board for nomination for election to the board in discharging its to identify qualified and diverse for the board the regularly the composition of the board and its and whether the addition of one or more with particular experience or would make the board and its more effective to that end the may engage director candidate search consultant to seek out who have the experience and that the are important to support the long term strategic and governance needs furthermore our already provide an adequate for for nomination to the board whom believe have certain experience or that might benefit the company and its as under the heading communicating with the board in this proxy statement may follow the to recommend for nomination for election to the board who the shareholder the for director candidate at our company all shareholder of potential director are to the for its review analysis and consideration and who are by will be by the on the same basis as all other director our board currently one member with significant in environmental rob retired chairman of the board currently as the chair of the executive committee of the board of of conservation international and he is also the chair of the state university global institute of therefore for the outlined above we believe that the policy in this shareholder proposal would unduly limit the ability of the and the board to review and select potential who in their judgment have the combination of experience and that are best to oversee the complex global business and oversee the company and its management in the strategic and business
