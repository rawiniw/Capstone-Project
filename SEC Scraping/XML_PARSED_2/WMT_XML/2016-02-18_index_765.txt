following information of certain non financial in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial calculated and in accordance with generally accepted accounting the company provided the non financial information in the press release which is not calculated or in accordance with as information supplemental and in addition to the financial in the press release that are calculated and in accordance with such non financial should not be considered superior to as substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the financial in the press release the non financial in the press release may differ from similar used by other calculation of return on investment and return on return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was the trailing ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as mart return on investment and return on twelve in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of were to reflect the adoption of interest imputation of interest the presentation of debt issuance cost for all free cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was the twelve and respectively the decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from partially offset by lower capital spending and the timing of free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in twelve in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating this operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of if any until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to

to for each of the three month and fiscal ended and is considered non financial measure under the sec because the for each such period certain not in the diluted earnings per share from attributable to calculated in accordance with for each of the three month and fiscal ended and management that the for each of the three month and fiscal ended and is meaningful metric to share with because that metric which for such period for certain in such period is the metric that best comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition the metric view of what management core earnings performance for each of the three month and fiscal ended and and also the ability to make more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated the for the three and the fiscal year ended by the for each period for the amount of the dilutive impact of the effect of the closure of globally the effect of certain discrete tax in the fourth quarter
