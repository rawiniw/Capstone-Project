management long term strategic with possible short term we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the increase in was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve primarily resulting from

factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of which the hypothetical capitalization of our operating because the lease standard was adopted prospectively as of our calculation of roi for the comparable fiscal period was not recast our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the
