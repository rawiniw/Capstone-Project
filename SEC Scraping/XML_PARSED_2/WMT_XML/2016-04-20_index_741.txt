operating income and roi are calculated on constant currency basis and exclude certain such as revenue from fuel see page for more information the that the metrics above are appropriate and effective in driving tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the considered the following these performance metrics are with our strategy and can be impacted by our unlike metrics tied to stock price or shareholder return our can have direct impact on our operating income and roi furthermore unlike earnings per share and other share based metrics operating income roi and are not materially impacted by our share repurchase program these metrics are important for retail performance operating income and roi have historically been and continue to be important of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these is important to our in addition ashes annual incentive is tied in part to key indicator of commerce performance the that success with respect to these metrics will support shareholder value over the long term at the request of the the independent compensation consultant the historical correlation of various performance metrics and within the retail industry the independent compensation consultant found that the metrics used in our incentive are with in the retail industry we believe that good performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value over the long term it is difficult to effectively apply relative and other relative performance metrics to executive compensation program there are several key in our business to other publicly in the our our significant international our product mix and our variety of additionally the price of common stock historically been less volatile than the common stock of most of our retail making relative an imprecise measure of our performance while the closely performance relative to that of our when making compensation that the best approach for is to tie our executive

the context of and consistent with the enterprise strategy and financial operating each fiscal year this process with the review of the overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and at an annual board strategic retreat each following the strategic retreat the annual operating of the company and each of its operating are established with and board input the then performance under our annual and long term incentive that are consistent with these operating incentive informed by financial process long range annual operating plan incentive march assess competitive landscape and macro refine enterprise strategy and segment specific develop annual operating plan in light of long range and strategic investor conference review strategy and capital review choice of incentive metrics to ensure that they support enterprise strategy establish performance with annual operating plan operating are intended to be and fiscal was no exception generally incentive are established so that performance in line with our operating should result in target in order to achieve the maximum our performance would have to exceed our operating to significant degree threshold performance are set at level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify the generally to set the performance so that consistent level of difficulty in these is from year to year the independent compensation consultant annually the difficulty of our target performance and consistently found these to be why does the set each year under our long term performance share unit program the found that the current approach of setting annually with determined by performance over three year period is the most effective approach for our long term performance share unit program for the following as global retailer operating are significantly impacted by and regional economic outside of control these economic as well as the rapidly retail industry make it difficult to forecast accurately over three year period for example in fiscal our were performance with three year and roi performance subsequently the global financial downturn in had the effect of making these three year virtually unachievable only few into the three year performance period the reasoned that performance cease to be an effective tool in performance if the either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve while some attempt to address the impact of by relative in their long term incentive the determined that relative are not the right approach for for the on page above the regularly performance relative to and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive are operating as intended another advantage of our current approach is more easily understandable and better performance which the are more effective in performance as above our incentive are with our business plan and regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on strategic and other setting three year for example would result in situation in which our have three at any one time one for each outstanding of performance share the that the current performance share unit structure effectively long term focus with clear and understandable performance proxy statement back to contents why do the used in our incentive differ from our of the objective in our incentive is to cause incentive to be calculated on comparable basis from year to year and to ensure that plan are and appropriately for these the following of are from our incentive and or our incentive by the of the incentive like many other our incentive which are shareholder require that incentive be calculated excluding the impact of currency exchange rate and and store and similar in fiscal these for the substantial majority of the difference between our of and our of as calculated for incentive plan in particular currency exchange rate significantly negatively impacted the net and operating income of our company and its international division as matter of policy we generally have not historically for currency exchange rate at the time incentive are established when the incentive it typically certain from the performance in particular the historically set that exclude the impact of fuel because fuel and therefore our fuel are volatile and subject to significant fluctuation which is out of our control also in light of our significant ongoing in global when the established fiscal operating income for our operating it limited the impact of operating attributable to the commerce of those operating for incentive plan in order to encourage our segment to make these necessary from commerce are not limited for of total company incentive so that operating are calculated on comparative basis from year to year consistent with the of our incentive the may exclude certain other so that can be calculated on comparative basis from year to year for example global review of accounting for during fiscal in accounting that our operating income the effects of which were for incentive plan the rigorous oversight and certification process to determine the to exclude from our of for of our incentive this process is not outcome driven and both positive and negative to of while in fiscal this process had net positive impact on incentive this is not always the case for example in fiscal and fiscal this process in reduction in incentive what were from fiscal of for incentive plan operating cash incentive plan for fiscal the substantial majority of from operating income for incentive plan were the following by the of the plan these included the impact of currency exchange rate income and related to and and related to store and taken together excluding these had net positive impact on our operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan and for the substantial majority of the difference between our operating income and our operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan at the time incentive are established these included to remove the impact of attributable to club commerce in excess of set limit established by the at the time were set excluding these had the impact of increasing operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan so that operating are calculated on comparative basis from year to year these included among related to our accounting for and an accrual related to our time off policy excluding these had net impact of increasing operating income for of our annual cash incentive plan cash incentive plan and long term performance share unit program for fiscal there were three primary to for of our incentive by the of the plan as we have in prior we the impact of currency exchange rate for of our incentive excluding this item had the impact of increasing total company and international for incentive plan at the time incentive are established as we have in prior we fuel from our incentive plan this exclusion had the impact of reducing for incentive plan so that operating are calculated on comparative basis from year to year we made an adjustment to our to reflect that certain wireless are for as rather than as assumed by our fiscal this adjustment had the effect of increasing for incentive plan proxy statement back to contents term performance share unit program to operating income operating income is component in the calculation of roi when calculating roi for long term incentive plan we exclude the same from operating income that are from the annual cash incentive calculation as above to average capital average capital is component in the calculation of roi when calculating fiscal roi for incentive plan we made certain to average capital these include that correspond to several operating income above such as those related to our accounting for and to store these had the net impact of decreasing our fiscal average capital for incentive plan the table below the net impact of the above as to our of performance metric actual performance as actual performance for incentive plan impact

compensation what other of compensation do our receive china long term cash incentive as president and of china during fiscal and portion of fiscal as such he was eligible for incentive payment under china cash incentive program covering fiscal through fiscal in early fiscal received of under this program which was of his maximum potential and to reflect the portion of the performance period during which as president and of china the fiscal performance under this program were based on china operating income performance as shown on the table below performance metric threshold target maximum actual performance china operating income increase over prior year special performance based on occasion the may grant special performance based to our the purpose of these is to drive strategic or operational important to our overall enterprise strategy by performance metrics that are not used in our annual and long term incentive the one such award in late fiscal and two such in late fiscal in the special performance based cash award opportunity for brewer in the amount of million in order for brewer to earn this award club gross membership income had to exceed the amount set forth in our business plan for club gross membership income by at least million during the one year period ending the this special award opportunity for brewer to drive performance in light of to increase membership and membership income which are key of our club strategy club gross membership income fell short of this goal and therefore brewer did not receive any with respect to this award in the grant of of performance based restricted stock to in order for one half of these to vest must meet expansion goal with respect to the availability of grocery in the by the end of fiscal the purpose of this award is to drive our grocery expansion key strategic priority for the other half of these will be conditioned on fiscal performance goal to be established by the at later date proxy statement back to contents also in the grant of of performance based restricted stock to in order for one half of these to vest must meet goal with respect to operating selling general and administrative during fiscal the purpose of this award is to emphasize the importance of in our operating segment even as we continue to make critical strategic the other half of these will be conditioned on fiscal performance goal to be established by the at later date feather in performance share under our long term performance share unit program we customarily make additional of performance share to newly hired or when are to significantly these feather in allow to realize performance share unit commensurate with their for three year that are already in progress we believe that this approach to effectively recruit and appropriately and reward short and long term performance and also retention value unlike some when retire or otherwise leave the company they forfeit all unvested performance share and we do not accelerate the vesting or otherwise pay out any unvested performance share in in connection with his recent promotion to executive vice president and received two additional feather in performance share vesting at the conclusion of the performance ending and these additional performance share were intended to increase target performance share opportunity for each of those to which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share award in for the performance cycle ending additional award under the of the management incentive plan the may award an additional cash incentive amount based on individual performance for his performance during fiscal the an additional cash incentive amount equal to of his target annual cash incentive award for fiscal approximately the this amount to based on the solid constant currency and operating income performance of international in difficult global environment as well as to strategic commerce in

risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally any that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation our performance based compensation is balanced between an annual incentive and long term incentive program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation reward performance based on mix of operating income based metrics based metrics and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance metrics any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one metric to the detriment of performance under other metrics for example our long term performance share plan is based equally on and roi performance we believe that this structure any incentive to pursue that would increase our at the detriment of roi performance the regularly the mix and of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation and that they are with our strategy and provide appropriate to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single performance cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to robust stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our

the of strategic importance to our company in addition the primary oversight of strategic and governance for our company is to board with independent each of the audit committee the the strategic and finance committee and the technology and committee are by independent these play critical role in our governance and strategy and each committee access to management and the authority to retain

structure clearly that the board the need for independence and effectiveness furthermore we believe our have the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re our chairman the lead independent director and other board each year for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no request for annual report regarding incentive compensation resolved that of mart urge the board of to adopt policy that the compensation and governance committee will annually analyze and report to at reasonable expense and proprietary information on whether incentive compensation and considered together provide appropriate to discourage senior from making that result in of return on investment roi taking into account the following over the previous three relationship between growth in capital and growth in operating income in roi relationship between same store growth also known as comparable store and total growth made to in connection with the measurement of performance for incentive and the extent to which at open for more than one year declined because of at newly cannibalization rate supporting statement as long term we believe that incentive compensation for senior should encourage sustainable value creation we are concerned that recent executive compensation at may overemphasize growth even when that growth in of roi and in some does not produce that cover the cost of capital specifically the replacement of same store metric repeatedly as critically total growth as the metric under performance share program encouraging senior to invest in even if doing so to cannibalization of and lower roi during the last five fiscal revenue at the us division grew by about but comparable store grew by just during that period capital grew at more than twice the rate of growth our we estimate that during this period the rate of percentage of store that us and club above that the use of growth for the annual incentive plan the and roi metrics used in the long term plan yet the addition of growth to the annual plan this claim metrics to ensure that our incentive reward underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of our proxy statement at these have metrics used for the last three in from all seven of the applied to and an adjustment for store and which are under the control of and reflect their management ability the weighted average performance of targeted performance yet his cash incentive payment of target on an unadjusted basis only of the weighted average performance target for his payment statement in opposition to proposal no is in period of change as we position our company to deliver seamless customer experience in our and through commerce during this period of change is making significant strategic in our people and technology in our public filings and other public we have outlined the impact these have had and are to have on our operating income and because operating income is component of roi these strategic also impact our roi board of is fully engaged with and supportive of our long term strategy and that these will position our company for long term growth our fiscal incentive compensation which are designed to be with our strategy and our annual operating plan reflect the impact of strategic as in the section of this proxy statement the and will continue to review our executive compensation program to ensure that the performance operating income and roi used in our incentive compensation properly our senior to achieve our strategic in light of our business strategy the again this year that the design of our performance based incentive compensation is with our strategy and operating plan and an appropriate balance between rewarding both annual and long term performance and the risk that our senior will make that overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of our company as whole furthermore the independent compensation consultant consistently that proxy statement back to contents the performance our incentive compensation are and that the under those are with our performance the importance of roi performance to our total compensation is in the narrative and in the in this proxy statement more than of our total direct compensation for fiscal was based on performance related to roi and operating income or combination of these metrics similar performance based approach is reflected in the total direct compensation for our over the prior five fiscal we average three separate of performance to determine the three year to our under our performance share program therefore because of the weight and emphasis on total company roi even slight fluctuation in roi performance for one fiscal year can lead to meaningful reduction in our performance share based incentive compensation because the already regularly and to our whether our incentive compensation provide proper to our to achieve our strategic we believe the adoption of the policy by the proposal is unnecessary duplicative of already by the and our company and would result in an expenditure of and our and time that ultimately would not be in our best furthermore our also have an opportunity to express their opinion of the incentive compensation and by of the annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no request for report regarding criteria for operating in high risk whereas the and exchange commission consistently that human constitute significant policy issue company in high risk with poor human risk damage to reputation and shareholder value presence in such as and all that have questionable human as it to suffrage and gay resolved the proponent the board review the for for its and issue report at reasonable expense excluding any proprietary information to by the report should identify criteria for in operating in and withdrawing from high risk supporting statement if the company the review may consider on or withdrawing from where the government engaged in systematic human in its review and report the company might also consider congruency analysis between its stated corporate and company in certain which an issue of misalignment with those corporate and the justification for such for example our state level religious freedom as anti homosexual bigotry saying we see firsthand the of diversity and inclusion have on our and we serve passage of to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of and does not reflect the we proudly uphold however in such as and where homosexual are these company are inconsistent with as by our additionally for massive in however in china the emitter of with questionable record on human and religious freedom again in this region appear to conflict with stated and the proponent that record to date gap between its lofty rhetoric and its performance the report would play role in illuminating and the accounting for this gap proxy statement back to contents statement in opposition to proposal no retail and or commerce in around the world each of which its own unique cultural economic social and political and that sometimes are very different from the united we also are company of full time and part time from variety of and life

this proxy statement are considered non financial under the because they are calculated by excluding or that would be included or in the calculation of comparable calculated in accordance with below we identify those non financial the non and tell you briefly how we compute them the financial measure calculated and in accordance with or only calculated and in accordance with that we believe is the most directly comparable such financial measure to each non measure each comparable measure the why we think the non provide our with useful information about our financial condition and of and reconciliation of each non measure with its comparable measure when we refer below to financial measure as being financial measure we are to financial measure that was in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal our diluted earnings per share from attributable to which we refer to as our are calculated in accordance with based our net income from attributable to although from time to time the company may believe that our for period does not reflect our core performance typically because of certain that the company in that period our for fiscal was such an instance and we calculated an diluted earnings per share amount for fiscal non measure the diluted earnings per share from attributable to which we refer to as for fiscal was calculated by the for fiscal for the amount of the per share dilutive impact of the effect of the closure of approximately globally the store the benefit from the immaterial cumulative adjustment related to certain in the third quarter of fiscal the lease adjustment and the effect of certain discrete tax in the fourth quarter of fiscal the discrete tax comparable measure the for fiscal as why the non measure is useful information management that the for fiscal is meaningful metric to share with because that metric which for fiscal for the in fiscal above is the metric that view of what management the core earnings performance for fiscal and also the ability to make more informed assessment of such core earnings performance reconciliation of the for fiscal to the for fiscal fiscal fiscal year ended lease adjustment discrete tax constant currency we use currency exchange to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar into for financial constant currency measure is one in which an item such as operating income for period is calculated by activity in functional currency other than the dollar into by the comparable prior year currency exchange and in non the constant currency consolidated revenue and constant currency consolidated operating income for fiscal comparable our consolidated total and consolidated operating income for fiscal respectively proxy back to contents why the are useful information these constant currency financial permit to understand better core performance in fiscal without the effects of in currency exchange which are subject to volatility from period to period in accordance with sec guidance we have not included quantitative reconciliation of the constant currency financial disclosed in the proxy statement reconciliation of each of the constant currency financial above to its comparable measure in our earnings release for the fourth quarter of fiscal which is available on our at stock other non financial the following performance metrics which as in the proxy statement to which this annex is attached the company to determine whether it will make under its annual cash incentive and the amount of any and whether will be made under its long term performance share and the amount of any are considered non financial our return on investment which we refer to as our roi our constant currency total company operating income our constant currency international operating income our constant currency total company excluding fuel our constant currency international excluding fuel and our club excluding fuel each such non financial is as under the caption executive discussion and goal setting philosophy and process in the proxy statement as permitted by the and guidance we do not disclose the financial calculated and in accordance with that are most directly comparable to such non financial or why we believe those non financial are important information for our to have or provide reconciliation of each of those non financial to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and in accordance with however we believe it is important for our to understand how we calculated the non above we calculated constant currency total company operating income and constant currency international operating income as above by the currency exchange for fiscal to translate the fiscal operating income for all where the functional currency is not the dollar into rather than the fiscal currency exchange used to calculate our total company operating income and international operating income to make those we calculated the constant currency total company excluding fuel by the us as to the constant currency international excluding fuel calculated as below and the club excluding fuel for fiscal which we calculated by club fuel in fiscal from fiscal we calculated the constant currency international excluding fuel by excluding all of fuel from its and the balance of those in those in which the functional currency is not the dollar into the currency exchange for fiscal and not the fiscal currency exchange the other under the caption executive discussion and goal setting philosophy and process were also made as part of the calculation of each non financial measure above our roi for fiscal is calculated as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for fiscal divided by average capital for fiscal we considered average capital for fiscal to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets for fiscal plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for fiscal plus rent factor equal to rent expense for fiscal by factor of eight we the impact of any from the calculation of our roi in the operating income component of roi we also made the same we made to calculate the constant currency total company operating income for of our annual cash incentive we also made certain balance sheet when calculating our average assets and average as under the caption executive discussion and goal setting philosophy and process although return on investment is standard financial measure our calculation
