more than five percent additionally related to are from comparable until such have been for comparable are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we use the term currency exchange to refer to the

from comparable period operating selling general and administrative percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative as percentage of net for the three and nine operating selling general and administrative operating as percentage of net and basis respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year for both the three and nine we did not leverage primarily due to legal accrual of million related to the matter the impact from within both and sam club an impairment of approximately million due to the decision to exit certain in one of our international and continued in and technology operating efficiency in our partially offset these strategic capital are more capital to technology and supply chain and less to store and club when to

open and table of we execute our financial framework we believe our on capital will improve over time we measure on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets the most directly comparable measure based on our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets while roi is considered non financial measure management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve ended roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve ended we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and in accordance with for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi table of calculation of and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital of metrics net cash provided by operating net cash used in and net cash used in we define free cash flow as net cash

the in net cash provided by operating and free cash flow were due to the timing of and an increase in incentive as well as lapping prior year in working capital management definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business
