value on brand name merchandise at only for both business and personal use internationally we operate with similar our fiscal year on for our and canada and on for all other this discussion to and its consolidated and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial as of and for the three month period then ended and the included in part item of this quarterly report on form as well as our consolidated financial as of and for the year then ended and the and the related discussion and analysis of financial condition and of both of which are in our annual report to for the year ended and incorporated by reference in and included as an exhibit to our annual report on form for the year ended we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial the in certain key in those financial from period to period and the primary that for those we also discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess our performance the discussion also information about the financial of the various of our business to provide better understanding of how those and their affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole our comprise three reportable the segment the international segment and the club segment the segment the mass merchant concept in the united and operating primarily under the or mart as well as the international segment of the outside of the united and the club segment the warehouse membership in the united and as well as throughout this discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income and comparable store and club the company the of its among other each operating income certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the under the caption other in the table below to operating income are primarily corporate overhead comparable store and club is measure of the performance of our and that the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and in format continue to be from comparable store when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in square footage of more than five percent comparable store are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in of our consolidated and the operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to convert the international operating from local into for financial the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not in the dollar company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the priority of growth on through comparable store or club and unit square footage growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net three ended dollar in millions net net international club net our consolidated net for the three ended when to the three ended the increase in net is primarily due to our continued expansion as we grew retail square by during the trailing ended net as result of strong currency exchange rate related to international for billion of the increase in net volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future calendar comparable store and club with fuel fuel impact club total total comparable store and club in the united fuel percent for the three ended the increase in comparable store and club in the three month period ended was primarily driven by increase in traffic and average ticket at club and an increase in average ticket at offset by decrease in traffic leverage operating income three ended dollar in millions international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net operating for the three ended operating when to the same period in the prior year while net over the same first quarter operating included million currency exchange rate impact our focus on every day low cost remains priority throughout the company operating income our operating income grew by for the three ended when to the same in the prior year while net by over net in the same prior year period operating income for the three ended included million currency benefit return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with possible short term roi was percent and percent for the trailing month ended and respectively the primary of the change in roi were the impact from currency exchange and cash for pending we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measurement is as dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period negative free cash flow was billion at due to our investment in inventory and timing of for to billion for the three ended free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash provided by in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash provided by of the following discussion of our of is based on our and therefore any or discussion of our we had several discrete that impacted the first quarter we approximately million from mark to market gains on foreign currency derivative which impacted other an approximate million charge related to the removal of future benefit and the effect of future pay from its defined benefit plan japan approximately million casualty loss related to the march earthquake and tsunami and chile approximately million gain from the sale of an investment all of these are tax and

volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future our gross profit as percentage of net gross profit for the three ended basis when to the same period in the prior year driven by shift in mix due to easter timing and investment in price as well as fuel related to the club segment operating as percentage of net were and for the three ended and respectively first

respectively we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be approximately to significant that may impact our effective tax rate include in our assessment of certain tax and the mix of earnings among our and international where the statutory are generally lower than the statutory rate as result of the above we billion and billion of income from for the three ended and respectively segment three in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period calendar comparable store operating income operating income as percentage of net unit retail square net for the segment slightly during the three ended when to the three ended the in net are primarily due to increase in year over year retail square offset by decline in comparable store comparable store for the three ended primarily due to decline in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in average ticket gross profit was flat for the three ended to the same period in the prior year operating as percentage of segment net were relatively flat for the three ended and respectively international segment three in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period operating income operating income as percentage of net unit retail square net for the international segment for the three ended when to the three ended the in net are primarily due to combination of growth in as well as as our continued expansion principally in brazil and china grew overall retail square footage by during the trailing twelve month period ended additionally in currency exchange provided favorable impact of billion to the international net for the three ended volatility in currency exchange may continue to affect the international segment in the future gross profit by basis for the three ended to the same period in the prior year the gross profit declined from last year is primarily due to the change in mix associated with the easter calendar shift and investment in price operating as
