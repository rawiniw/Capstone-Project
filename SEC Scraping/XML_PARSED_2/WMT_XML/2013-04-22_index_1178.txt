compensation our each receive base salary annual cash incentive opportunity long term performance and service based restricted stock these comprise each total direct compensation or base salary we pay base to attract and retain talented and to provide fixed base cash compensation our general objective is for our neo base to be positioned near the th percentile of our peer considered as whole in keeping with our philosophy that substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the typically relatively small percentage of to base salary annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried our are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment each annual target cash incentive award is based on percentage of base salary the cash incentive can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our target opportunity is percent of his base salary and his actual can range from percent of his base salary at threshold up to maximum of percent of his base salary no will be made unless threshold performance are met the the performance under our management incentive plan during the first quarter of each fiscal year our general guideline is to set annual cash incentive at level that our target near the th percentile of our peer considered as whole however individual target will vary based on the under how does the establish on long term equity the balance of and generally the portion is then between two of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity help the of our with the of our and also serve as retention tool for our consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance percent of our annual long term equity is in the form of performance with the percent in the form of restricted stock our general guideline is to set annual equity at level that our target near the th percentile of our peer considered as whole however individual target will vary based on the under how does the establish on performance performance share award the recipient the right to receive number of if we meet certain defined performance during

our compensation for fiscal there were no significant to the basic structure for in fiscal for fiscal our in the same position received base salary ranging from approximately percent to approximately

comparable to those of some of our is not available for many of the in our peer three peer in number of comparable against which our compensation can be the data when each among the various of compensation as general guide to ensure that the amount of to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation the did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative to any of these peer or to any particular of peer group when against them while the data is generally used for comparable the also peer group data for retail for our proxy statement back to contents who lead our operating these have significant and we believe that these are often comparable to at many of our peer group in addition

executive have any in place stock one non management director related to line of credit as disclosed on page under of and risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our performance based incentive compensation generally reward mix of different performance namely operating income based based and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating division to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe motivate our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold our executive fiscal cash incentive are subject to reduction if certain compliance are not satisfied finally our cash

proposal our company will provide the and to our knowledge of the of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to mart vice president and general counsel corporate division southwest th street the board vote against each of the following shareholder based on policy as set forth in in opposition following each shareholder proposal in our in opposition we have not to refute all of the made about in the shareholder proxy statement back to contents proposal no special meeting right resolved ask our board to take the necessary unilaterally to the extent permitted by law to amend our and each appropriate governing document to give of of our outstanding common stock or the permitted by law above the power to call special meeting this that such bylaw and or charter will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language in regard to calling special meeting that apply only to but not to management and or the board to the extent permitted by law this proposal does not impact our current power to call special meeting special allow to vote on important such as that can arise between annual input on the timing of is especially important when unfold quickly and may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal topic won more than support at sprint and this proposal should also be in the context of our overall corporate governance as in the corporate library an independent investment research firm had rated our company continuously since the first term of the bush administration with high governance risk also concern for our and high concern in executive pay million for duke annual incentive pay on only one performance goal operating income mix of performance is better not just to prevent our from the temptation to game but to ensure that they do not take to achieve one goal that might ultimately damage another despite missing operating income duke received million in annual incentive pay our highest continued to be given restricted stock that simply over time without job performance equity pay should have job performance to with shareholder interest these also were given so long term incentive of performance which were based on short term of our highest received the key to the corporate jet for their personal travel because such perk is not tied to job performance it is difficult to justify in of shareholder value two were inside another director was former executive and two other were potentially due to related party with with mart additionally there are several other related party and mart that raised regarding the effectiveness of our board in the of us the minority in spite of the of the vote four received double in negative lee duke and chairman please vote to protect shareholder value special meeting right proposal statement in opposition to proposal no the board that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best of our company or its consistent with corporate law our provide that special meeting of may be by majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for public company of our because it our board according to its fiduciary to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best of to convene special meeting with as little as of the outstanding regardless of the holding period to call special for any reason and at any time the risk of special being by relatively small minority of on narrow or short term rather than the long term best of the company and all of its we take very seriously and take to provide with access to our making our available via holding special meeting of our at the request of only of our would be costly undertaking involve substantial and require us to commit significant and attention to the legal and logistical of such meeting for example we would incur legal printing and associated with and the disclosure for special meeting the board also that the of this proposal should be in light of our high of corporate governance as in this proxy statement our governance and provide with access to the board and of senior management and offer ample opportunity for to express their to management these governance include the annual election of all board and majority voting requirement for the election of the board also determined to include an advisory vote on executive compensation at each annual meeting until the next vote on the frequency of shareholder on executive compensation because the board it is important to receive feedback from on this important issue annually in addition may submit shareholder which if appropriate under the may be included in our annual proxy statement and on at our annual meeting furthermore the governing listed on the and incorporated under law require us to submit certain to vote of for approval such as large share or similar and the approval of equity based compensation for the above the board that vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no equity retention requirement resolved of mart the company urge the compensation committee of the board of the committee to adopt policy that senior retain of acquired through equity compensation until reaching normal retirement age or employment with the company for the purpose of this policy normal retirement age shall be defined by the qualified retirement plan that the number of plan the recommend that the committee adopt share requirement of at least percent of net after tax the policy should prohibit hedging for subject to this policy which are not but reduce the risk of loss to the executive this policy shall supplement any other share ownership that have been established for senior and should be so as not to violate the contractual or the of any compensation or benefit plan currently in effect supporting statement equity based compensation is an important component of senior executive compensation at our company while we encourage the use of equity based compensation for senior we are concerned that our senior are generally free to sell received from our equity compensation in our opinion the current share ownership for its senior do not go far enough to ensure that the equity compensation continue to build stock ownership by senior over the long term for example our share ownership require the chief executive officer the to hold an amount of equal to five his salary or approximately based on current trading in comparison the currently million in our company the up to performance share assuming maximum performance and restricted in other even if performance are one equity are more than half the share ownership guideline for the we believe that senior to only hold equal to set target effectiveness over time after satisfying these target holding senior are free to sell all the additional they receive in equity compensation our proposal to better link executive compensation with long term performance by meaningful share retention ratio for received by senior from the equity compensation senior to hold of through equity compensation until they reach retirement age will better the of with the of and the company report by the conference board task force on executive compensation that such hold through retirement give an ever growing incentive to focus on long term stock price performance as the equity subject to the policy conference board free we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no we have adopted robust stock ownership and other governance to ensure that our executive and certain other are on long term success and that their are with those of our as in the above stock ownership require that our maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted stock equal in market value to five his current annual base salary and that all of our executive and certain other must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted stock equal in market value to three his or her current annual base salary these have five from their appointment to position covered by our stock ownership to achieve these of ownership if any covered officer is not in compliance with the he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in compliance with the until such time as he or she is in compliance with the and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the as disclosed in the each of our currently subject to the ownership is in compliance with these and in many own stock significantly in excess of the guideline for example as disclosed in the and noted in the proposal our valued at more than his current base salary while certain of our subject to the have not yet been in position covered by the for five each of these is to be in compliance with the at the time he or she the applicable compliance date in addition to the ownership the insider trading policy the ability of the of the board and executive to engage in speculative company stock as in the above the insider trading policy hedging such as and similar financial that would eliminate or limit the and of stock ownership furthermore of the board and executive may not at any time use stock as collateral for loan before stock as collateral for any other borrowing of our board and executive must have the arrangement by corporate secretary and any by member of the board or an executive officer will not be when whether the member of the board or executive officer is in compliance with the stock ownership additionally the insider trading policy short selling or selling or whether exchange or otherwise or engaging in any other transaction in derivative that speculation about the price of our stock or that may place the financial of the of the board and executive against the financial of our company moreover we believe the is the governing body best to formulate the executive compensation as in the the designed our executive compensation program so that long term equity are generally the portion of our annual compensation the long term equity are percent in the form of performance which vest if the company defined performance over three year period provided the executive remains employed by our company and percent in the form of restricted stock which on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the executive proxy statement back to contents remains employed by our company these are designed to help the of our with the of our and also serve as retention tool for our policy that would require senior to hold percent of their equity until reaching normal retirement age would put our company at competitive disadvantage for recruiting and retaining talent and is not common practice among our peer in addition this policy would restrict the ability of our to diversify their investment and could motivate to leave than they otherwise would have so they could realize the value of their equity compensation for the foregoing we believe this proposal is unnecessary and would provide no benefit to the company or its stock ownership and other governance effectively facilitate significant stock ownership by and the proposal would not be in the best of for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no independent chairman resolved the of mart the company ask the board of to adopt policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be director who not previously as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these director shall not be considered independent if during the last three he or she was or was with company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had personal service contract with the company or its senior management was with company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or of its gross annual from the company had business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under the and exchange commission been employed by public company at which an executive officer of the company as director had relationship of the sort above with any affiliate of the company and was spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person above the policy should be without any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if current chairman to be independent between annual shareholder compliance with the policy may be if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement the board of led by its chairman is responsible for protecting long term by providing independent oversight of management the chief executive officer in the in our view this oversight can be when the chairman is not independent we believe that an independent chairman who and for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and help ensure the objective of an effective board we view the alternative of lead outside director even one with robust set of as adequate only in exceptional fully disclosed by the board recent bribery and corruption at the subsidiary highlight the need for enhanced oversight of corporate culture and behaviour board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change several recommend such separation corporate core and state that the independence of majority of the board is not enough the leadership of the board must embrace independence and it must ultimately change the way in which interact with management in yale school of report endorsed by number of and that splitting the two as the default provision for we urge you to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no always strived to maintain high corporate governance in keeping with this goal the board the of chairman and since as stated in our corporate governance the board policy of separating the of chairman and as under the heading board leadership structure above we believe this separation of our to focus on complex daily we also believe that separate chairman on oversight and governance the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have number of other key corporate governance that ensure our board independently of management independent director since our board an independent director over executive sessions of our non management and independent majority independent board currently of the of our board are independent and of the board are non management fully independent key board all of the audit committee and compensation and governance committee are independent the of these are heavily engaged in for committee annual board and board committee self as by our corporate governance the board and each of the board evaluate their organization and each year to ensure that the board and board are effectively our chairman more than of experience with and is well positioned to provide our with guidance advice and counsel regarding business and strategy moreover our significant proxy statement back to contents ownership stake in our company unparalleled alignment with the of his fellow our have the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re our chairman and other board by wide each year we note that the proponent in its supporting statement report by the yale school of for corporate governance and performance the board the case for independent leadership in corporate north available at yale yale the board final the report far from supporting this proposal significant portion of the report on the value of separating the of chair and structure that already in place moreover the report that there is no one all approach to board leadership the vast majority of of the separation of the of chair and that specific company may warrant the combination under exceptional in these most would agree that should explain to why such an alternative model best the long term of the corporation and its for example situation in which company may choose to explain rather than comply with separating the may include enterprise in which the and chair is the majority report at for the above the board that vote against this proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that of mart urge the board of the board to adopt policy the policy that will disclose annually whether in the previous fiscal year any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as result of determination that the senior executive company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the of or detrimental to for of this proposal senior executive former senior executive the policy should provide that the general of the recoupment or forfeiture will be the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind above in the previous fiscal year statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture by law or regulation supporting statement as long term we believe that compensation should promote sustainable value creation we agree with former ge general counsel ben that recoupment with business related misconduct are powerful mechanism for holding senior leadership accountable to the fundamental mission of the corporation proper risk taking balanced with proper risk management and the robust fusion of high performance with high integrity law making sense out of in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon finding of unethical conduct management incentive plan for recoupment of incentive compensation in the previous if the compensation and governance committee the committee that the recipient engaged in any act inimical to the best of the company or to comply with company management incentive plan section similarly the stock incentive plan for forfeiture of outstanding and repayment of received in respect of certain plan in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to best stock incentive plan of section separation with several recently retired senior state that is to suspend and recoup made under any agreement with the executive if failure on the part to abide by statement of ethics is discovered disclosure of the application of these recoupment forfeiture to senior would inform whether the have been applied and allow to hold of the committee accountable for their administration of the for example disclosure would enable to determine whether compensation from any current or former senior executive as result of foreign corrupt act currently being in china and brazil business mart foreign bribery investigation all we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no the board that vote against this proposal because sec disclosure already require sufficient regarding comprehensive recoupment and the board and our management believe that compensation should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation offer and other numerous and that give us broad to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to or former who have engaged in misconduct we believe that these recoupment are than those provided to the and management of many and reflect strong commitment to ethics and integrity broad recoupment include the following our cash incentive plan that participant must have with our statement of ethics at all in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment moreover participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the within twelve of its payment that prior to the payment the participant any of our or otherwise inimical to the best of our company proxy statement back to contents our stock incentive plan that if the that an associate any act detrimental to the best of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised and unvested of restricted stock and performance when an executive officer leaves we generally enter into separation agreement that he associate that the associate with the applicable statement of ethics during the employment the discovery of failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle to suspend and recoup any or due under this agreement or any other between the our statement of ethics among other all from being dishonest acting illegally and between the work and personal and the board are to recoupment against current and former to have unethically we already are by sec disclosure to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation been and the amount from our moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation and compensation regarding the we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be this proposal to require these with respect to all current and former senior term that is not defined in the proposal however as noted above the disclosure already require to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive who during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such meet the definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure to all current and former senior is warranted in sum the board this proposal is unnecessary because sec disclosure already require sufficient regarding comprehensive recoupment and for the above the board that vote against this proposal other our company is not aware of any that will be considered at the annual meeting other than the in this proxy statement if any other are properly
