additionally the discussion information about the financial of the three of our business to provide better understanding of how each of those and its of affect the financial condition and of of the

segment operating income comparable store and club and other management the of the company each segment operating income certain corporate overhead as well as other from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment operating income certain corporate overhead table of and other as determined by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period and are to conform to the current period presentation comparable store and club is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as commerce we measure the commerce impact by those through our and through our commerce distribution as well as an estimate for but through our and in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income table of performance are to helping save money and live better through everyday low by everyday low at we adjust our business to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the in which we operate for several our performance metrics have three financial growth leverage and we are currently making strategic in our and in the integration of digital and physical retail these support long term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low which are by everyday low cost during this time of we have our financial to focus primarily on growth balanced by we will continue to grow through and and through increasing comparable store and club which include our commerce while leverage remains important to everyday low cost during this time of operating may grow greater than or equal to our growth and operating income may grow equal to or less than growth our objective of balancing growth with that we are on efficiently assets for return on investment and more effectively working capital to deliver strong free cash flow we will also continue to provide to our through share and table of measure growth primarily by net and comparable store and club we also review the progress of our digital retail by measuring the impact commerce have on our comparable store and club at we make strategic which are on the long term growth of the company these strategic may not benefit net and comparable store and club in the near term net ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for the three and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the decrease in net for the three was primarily the result of negative impact from in currency exchange and million decrease in fuel due to lower fuel partially offset by year over year growth in retail square positive comparable in the segment and higher commerce across the company calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and were as three ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel for when to the same period in the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club were negatively impacted by lower fuel due to lower fuel partially offset by higher commerce and continued traffic improvement at the segment commerce positively impacted comparable approximately and for and sam club respectively for the three to positive of approximately and for and sam club respectively in the same period in the previous fiscal year strategic growth the three we made capital globally of billion these capital primarily of to add and remodel and construct distribution and invest in technology in addition we made operational of approximately million in commerce to approximately million in the same period in the previous fiscal year we also made of approximately million in connection with associate wage structure and comprehensive associate training and educational during the first quarter table of we are primarily on growth we also place priority on generating to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced we generate by efficiently assets and effectively working capital we monitor these through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics which we discuss below in addition we are on providing to our in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital section return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the slight change in roi was primarily due to continued in and digital retail offset by benefit from currency exchange rate we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the three to free cash flow of the three the decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to lower income from the timing of for inventory and the timing of for income definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by

and share we use intercompany in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash provided by operating with long term debt and short term accordingly we intend with only certain to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash outside of the in our foreign when the income either from or through intercompany and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the within our foreign could be to the although
