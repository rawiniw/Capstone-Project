regular business such as to government for information handling legal or regulatory and real estate design and construction these third provide and make our more efficient but because these and interact with government around the world they also impact our risk profile we seek to be both innovative and deliberate in this risk we have thorough process to screen and conduct due diligence on potential third party as part global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year of that process we worked with external to create electronic system that for third party in our business and due diligence on and who seek to represent us additionally when we contract with third party we require them to adopt to follow our we want to help our third party understand and apply these so weve heavily in training as of the end of we have provided training to over third party and in addition to reducing our risk by providing this training we have also provided our third party with the ability to share our learning training with throughout their organization this past year we also what we consider to be leading practice in compliance in addition to the screening due diligence
