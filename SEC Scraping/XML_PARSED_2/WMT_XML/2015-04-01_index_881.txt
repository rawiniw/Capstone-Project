by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to understand better underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense have been among to be comparable with the current

priority of growth on through growth in net comparable store and club commerce and unit square growth the priority of leverage our objective to increase our operating income at the same rate as or faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently we employ assets through return on investment and how effectively we manage working capital through free cash flow while all three are important our priority is growth with investment in digital retail and our growth will contribute to improving leverage and over time table of ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the increase in net for fiscal was primarily due to year over year growth in retail square positive comparable in the and higher commerce across the company the increase was partially offset by negative impact from in currency exchange for fiscal the increase in net for fiscal was due to growth in retail square higher commerce the impact of fiscal and positive comparable club at sam club the increase in net for fiscal was partially offset by negative impact from in currency exchange calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal and were as fiscal ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel in fiscal and in fiscal when to the previous fiscal year the fiscal total comparable store and club were positively impacted by higher traffic and lower gas during the end of the fiscal year commerce positively impacted comparable approximately and for and sam club respectively for the fiscal year ended for fiscal the total comparable store and club were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to the slow recovery in general economic the increase in the payroll tax rate and the reduction in government food and severe winter that during the fourth quarter these were partially offset by member traffic at sam club primarily coming from additionally commerce positively impacted the comparable store and sam club comparable club by approximately for fiscal as we continue to add and in the we do so with an understanding that additional and may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club as result of opening and was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by the of the impacted and which are based on their proximity to the and to those of nearby non impacted and in each case as measured after the and are table of ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe both the growth of our operating and our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at the same rate as or faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating fiscal operating when to the previous fiscal year while net respectively when to the previous fiscal year accordingly we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net our continued in digital retail higher health care in the from enrollment and medical cost inflation the of wage and hour litigation in the as well as of million related to the closure of approximately in japan were the primary that us not to leverage for fiscal for fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net as operating as percentage of net basis overall lower than higher investment in key such as global leverage and digital retail and the nearly billion of for various in the international segment discussion were the primary cause for the increase in operating as percentage of net during the first quarter of fiscal the company associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and educational we anticipate the additional in fiscal resulting from these will be approximately billion which may impact our ability to leverage operating in fiscal operating fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or faster rate than net as operating income while net when to the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the we for not operating for fiscal we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net as operating income while net when to the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the we for not operating partially offset by in membership and other income of table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the fiscal ended and respectively the slight change in roi was primarily due to continued in store growth and digital retail offset by currency exchange rate we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as fiscal ended in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of billion fiscal and respectively the increase in free cash flow for fiscal when to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the timing of for payable and as well as the timing of income tax combined with lower capital the fiscal decline in free cash flow when to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the timing of income tax as well as lower income from and slightly higher capital definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment

from enrollment and medical cost inflation for fiscal sam club did not leverage as operating as percentage of segment net basis when to the previous fiscal year the increase in operating as percentage

our accounting how they are applied and how they are and disclosed in our financial following is summary of our critical accounting and how they are applied in preparation of the financial value at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the segment the inventory at the international segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting the first in first out fifo method the retail method of accounting in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent are immediately as reduction of the retail value of inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued based on the weighted average cost the lifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market which is determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent the retail method of accounting management to make certain and that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit made include recording used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management the ability to sell inventory for clearance activity and the related cost impact are considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer could cause material in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary we record lifo provision for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo we provide for inventory or shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of percentage of following annual inventory the provision is to reflect historical impairment of evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable management regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and operational performance such as operating income and cash the evaluation for long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level or in certain at the market group level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that of impairment exist and require impairment be which could result in management the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be generally this evaluation with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after an assessment based on the qualitative that the fair value of the unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that fair value of the unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be the
