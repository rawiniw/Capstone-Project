other than the herein if any other are properly brought before the annual meeting the proxy will vote the as to which they hold in their discretion executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis executive summary in the following we discuss how our and certain other executive our executive or were in fiscal through and describe how this compensation within our executive compensation philosophy our financial performance for fiscal was mixed while our earnings performance our original guidance provided at the beginning of fiscal when our incentive were set the performance of our us division was disappointing we continued to experience stable tax with return on investment roi for fiscal slightly less than the prior fiscal year our stock price moderately during fiscal and we returned approximately billion to our in the form of share and the key financial on which our incentive compensation are based are operating income and roi despite our strong earnings performance and stable in fiscal our overall fiscal performance was slightly below our target performance under our cash incentive plan and below our target performance under our long term equity incentive program this performance impacted our compensation under our incentive for fiscal in particular our cash incentive payment that was slightly below target for fiscal and approximately percent less than his cash incentive payment for the prior year similarly during fiscal we fell short of our target performance under our long term performance share plan resulting in reduction of our long term equity incentive for fiscal and for future our compensation program performance our total direct compensation for base salary annual cash and long term equity are heavily weighted towards performance base salary less than percent of each target opportunity less than percent for the and substantial majority at least percent of each target opportunity is contingent on meeting operating income and return on investment that we believe have meaningful impact on shareholder value our annual cash incentive is based primarily on the operating income of our company and or one or more operating depending on each with the exception of the president and of our us division whose cash incentive for fiscal was based on combination of operating income and our long term performance share program is based on total company roi and the performance of one or more operating depending on each area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and the balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating financial performance and shareholder value and the risk that our will overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of our company as whole table of contents in addition our executive compensation program to balance long term and annual performance our annual cash incentive plan is primarily based on operating income during single fiscal year while our long term performance share plan is based on and roi over three year period our also receive service based restricted stock which typically over three to five after the grant date along with performance restricted stock our ownership in the company as well as serving as retention tool the regularly our executive compensation to ensure that compensation is competitive but remains closely tied to performance that can be impacted by our and that the is with shareholder value in addition the that the and of our performance based compensation are in light of the of and our to our and other as well as the internal of the board and our company our incentive during fiscal the compensation by our for fiscal that our incentive are working as designed while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was slightly below the fiscal goal under our annual cash incentive plan as result our cash incentive payment for fiscal was million which was slightly less than his target to maximum cash incentive payment of million for fiscal with respect to our long term performance share program our roi stable but was slightly below the target performance goal under this plan and our performance fell significantly short of our target performance under this plan as result with respect to the portion of performance dependent on fiscal performance our approximately percent less than his target opportunity to approximately percent above target in fiscal because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only did this result in lower performance share for fiscal but will impact our performance share for fiscal and fiscal as well who are the executive covered in this proxy statement for fiscal our were duke president and duke our company in and in number of prior to becoming president and in executive vice president president and us our company in and was to his present position on june executive vice president president and international our company in and was to his current position in wright vice chairman responsible for global and global wright our company in and assumed his current on june executive vice president and the company in and was to on retired executive vice president and our company in and retired as on an executive vice president of our company through to assist in to his role we discuss the compensation of six rather than five because was to during fiscal and sec require disclosure for all who as during any part of the last fiscal year impact of fiscal performance on executive compensation how was fiscal performance reflected in our executive compensation cash incentive plan while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was slightly below the fiscal performance goal under our annual cash incentive plan as result our cash incentive payment for fiscal was slightly less than the target each of our other with the exception of whose incentive was based in part on the operating income of our international division also received an incentive below target table of contents moreover because our growth in operating income during fiscal was not as strong relative to our performance as it was in fiscal our less under our cash incentive plan for fiscal than for fiscal the following table our fiscal and fiscal under our cash incentive plan company division fiscal of target fiscal of target total company us international club as result our who continued in the same smaller cash incentive payment for fiscal as to fiscal for example our cash incentive payment for fiscal that was almost less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal duke fiscal year of target cash performance share plan with respect to our long term performance share plan our roi was slightly below the target performance goal under our long term incentive plan and our performance fell significantly short of our target performance under this plan as result as shown in the table below we fell short of our performance share applicable to our by approximately percent to percent for fiscal to performance that was generally above target in fiscal because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only did this result in lower performance share for fiscal but it will also impact our performance share for fiscal and fiscal as well company division fiscal performance share of target fiscal performance share of target total company us international club as result of our fiscal performance the combined value of performance share for fiscal fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million less than if we had our target performance share for fiscal assuming stock price of per share which was the price of on the on actual to our for the three year period ended are shown below on page fiscal performance and performance what performance metrics were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal commensurate with the philosophy our fiscal was substantially performance based each performance are based on the performance of our total company or combination of the performance of our total company and the operating division this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating based on performance within their control or influence while still tying significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company to drive the business the performance applicable to our fiscal compensation were element of compensation fiscal performance metrics annual cash incentive operating income total company and or divisional us only performance total company return on investment total company us club international table of contents for of the performance we define return on investment which is non measure as defined in the as operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight the chose these performance to with the strategic of growth leverage and the that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to our to achieve performance that is in line with the best of our company and our in addition the that the combination and weighting of these performance metrics to mitigate the risk that our would be to pursue with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive what were our specific performance for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to these in actual performance for of our performance based the made certain positive and negative to our as provided by the of the these are intended to enable for particular fiscal year to be on comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our incentive reward underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of our for fiscal the most significant adjustment was to remove the impact of in currency exchange other were to exclude the operating income related to recent to exclude for litigation and to adjust for the accounting treatment of of phone as result of this adjustment process the fiscal operating income and us shown in the tables below differ from our publicly operating for fiscal under annual cash incentive payment the growth applicable to the cash incentive are expressed in of percentage increase over our prior year performance for fiscal the threshold target and maximum performance under our cash incentive plan and our actual performance are shown in the following table fiscal cash incentive plan percentage increase over fiscal goal applicable to threshold target maximum actual total company operating income international operating income club operating income us operating income us the shown above in the following annual cash incentive to our for fiscal fiscal cash incentive performance of salary duke us us operating income total company operating income international operating income total company operating income wright us operating income total company operating income total company operating income total company operating income table of contents portion of each cash incentive payment is also subject to meeting diversity for fiscal these of two placement and good faith under our diversity program each cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not achieve applicable diversity for the fiscal year based on the report of our chief diversity officer the determined that each neo satisfied his diversity for fiscal performance the following table the performance set by the for fiscal under our performance share program and our performance against those performance period performance measure performance as threshold target maximum total company total company club excluding fuel international these were with the for fiscal and fiscal the other two fiscal within the three year performance period as to the established by the to determine the ultimate performance share for the performance with three year performance cycle ending performance share percent of target for year three fiscal performance fiscal fiscal fiscal year performance performance performance average target duke roi total company roi us roi international wright roi us roi total company roi total company performance share for the three year cycle ended was based on the performance of our international division for fiscal when he as vice chairman international and on the performance of our total company during fiscal and fiscal when he as president and performance share for the three year cycle ended was based on the performance of our club division for fiscal when he as president and of that division and on the performance of our international division during fiscal and fiscal when he as president and of that division of fiscal compensation and pay mix what are the other of our compensation in addition to the annual cash incentive and long term performance above our also receive base salary and service based restricted stock award these four comprise each total direct compensation or consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance each annual restricted stock award is one third the target value of the performance share award table of contents what was the pay mix of our in fiscal for fiscal base salary less than percent of each target opportunity and substantial majority of each target opportunity was comprised of annual cash incentive and performance that is compensation that is contingent on satisfying balance of performance that we believe have meaningful impact on shareholder value as shown in the following the within the may not total due to rounding the in the above reflect the compensation associated with and current after their on june and respectively what other of compensation did our receive in fiscal our may from time to time receive special special are typically for retention or in recognition of extraordinary performance because

which are on page table of contents what and other do our receive our receive limited number of and supplemental we cover the cost of annual physical we provide each neo with personal use of our

provide these and supplemental to attract talented to our company and to retain our current fiscal total direct compensation opportunity what was the for the in fiscal and the other covered in the summary compensation table the following table the established for each neo for fiscal through fiscal as shown in the table below target the our would receive if target performance are maximum the that our would receive if maximum performance are and is therefore intended to reflect the our would receive only in the event of exceptional performance executive officer annual cash incentive total cash equity target target target target duke wright as above because our overall performance during fiscal was not as strong as our performance during fiscal our less of their opportunity during fiscal as to fiscal the shown for and above reflect the compensation associated with their current after their on june and respectively because and were first to neo in fiscal only information for fiscal is included for them in the table above why is different than the shown in the summary compensation table inclusion of the table above is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the decision making process when neo compensation the summary compensation table that on page specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal for our in the manner by sec the in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation by the for our nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation that may actually be by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance for example because the typically annual equity to our prior to the start of the fiscal year the equity for fiscal appear on the summary compensation table as part of fiscal compensation table of contents what were the significant to our compensation for fiscal there were no significant to the basic structure for in fiscal for fiscal the selected total company and or divisional growth as the metric under our performance share program for corporate support and for our us and club comparable store which had been used in previous this change was intended to our performance share more closely with our business strategy which productive growth leverage and in addition for responsible for the us division us total growth was added as component of our cash incentive program in order to place greater emphasis on performance for fiscal the base salary for messrs duke wright and relatively flat the fiscal base salary for those range from percent to percent which is consistent with annual base salary for management generally with respect to and their base as well as their overall were to reflect their as the of the us operating division and as our respectively and to their target to be competitive taking into consideration that both were to their leadership the in the equity for messrs duke and and the decrease in annual incentive opportunity for wright were made in light of their and to their compensation to be competitive in accordance with the objective of target that is in the quartile of the peer for their respective how is between annual and long term compensation majority of each fiscal was to performance which have three year performance period an additional portion of fiscal was to restricted stock which for fiscal in three equal on the second third and fifth of the grant date the following illustrate this allocation for our and for our other as group we believe that this mix appropriately annual and long term performance executive compensation philosophy and process who the at the is the committee of the board that is responsible for and the compensation of the subject to section which the and other the of the are independent see and for more information on the the met eight in fiscal during each of these the considered executive compensation the review and approval of compensation for our the selection of performance metrics and performance applicable to neo compensation and the review of performance against those metrics table of contents what is the compensation philosophy in the philosophy is that substantial portion of should be tied to performance that the business and that the executive can impact this philosophy on the long term of and to the of the with the continued growth and long term performance this philosophy the the executive compensation program to provide fair competitive compensation based on performance and to the company provide to attract and retain key instill long term commitment to the company and develop sense of company ownership how does the establish the process of setting is dynamic one the among other our overall financial and operating performance and business as applicable each individual performance and to the achievement of financial and operational each job historical compensation and and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each potential to assume greater in the future and the peer group data and analyses see for more detail generally our target which would be if target performance are place the in the quartile of the peer for their respective the that it is generally appropriate to position our target at this level because as the retailer the extensive international presence and complex result in our neo greater level of complexity than similar at many of our peer group the target opportunity for executive may be less than the quartile of the peer depending on number of particularly time and experience in similar role in individual performance the on annual performance for each neo and with the supervisor the in among our are due to many these include the in job scope and the review of peer group compensation information through peer and of experience historical compensation retention and succession and individual and where relevant divisional performance the set forth in the table on page represent the judgment as to the appropriate compensation in light of these how is among the various of compensation base salary in keeping with our philosophy that substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the typically relatively small percentage of to base salary because our more senior typically have large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our advance in our company annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management our are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment the target opportunity for the annual cash incentive is based on percentage of base salary the cash incentive can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our target opportunity is percent of his base salary and he can earn cash incentive from percent of his base salary at threshold to maximum of percent of his base salary the cash incentive on whether we achieve established performance and no will be made unless the threshold performance are met the the performance in the first quarter of the fiscal year long term equity the balance of generally the portion is then between two of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity help the of our with the of our as well as providing retention tool consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance percent of the annual equity award is in the form of performance with the percent in the form of restricted stock performance performance share award the officer it the right to receive number of if we meet certain performance during performance period generally performance to our table of contents have three year performance period with the performance metrics set annually by the the number of received at is based on the average performance over three fiscal the can earn from percent at threshold to maximum of percent of the target number of restricted stock the percent of the equity value is in the form of restricted stock which for fiscal had vesting schedule of three equal on the second fourth and fifth of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting how does the set performance the for our performance based are established in light of the operating for our company and each of its the operating to reach our strategic are by the board in light of economic in our industry and in the in which we operate the operating are generally intended to be and fiscal was no exception particularly given the economic environment for our core customer in order to achieve the target in our performance based our company and must perform in line with our operating income and return on investment and operating at the time the were set in order to achieve the maximum the performance of our company and operating would have to exceed those by significant amount generally for our international division require greater in operating income and relative to our other this our strategic growth for our international in light of market and the level of capital investment for growth in the international in which we operate the generally to set the threshold and maximum performance so that consistent level of difficulty in these is from year to year the generally the maximum performance at level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance at level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify payment the performance established by the for fiscal were in light of the economic do our receive any compensation that is not included in on occasion we grant our our special that are not included in these are generally in the form of performance based restricted stock or restricted stock and are intended for retention and or to reward exceptional performance also the may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target for that neo based upon the subjective evaluation of that individual performance and wright were special equity in as above on page our also receive limited as above on page in addition our receive other generally available to our such as participation in our plan our stock purchase plan and other available to our such as our deferred compensation plan our also receive certain and supplemental above other compensation are there any significant to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged in march the established performance metrics and for the fiscal performance based there were two notable made in the long term equity award to further the performance share program with the of improving growth leverage and in addition the are intended to provide more clarity for and to make the program more competitive first with respect to performance the growth weighting was from percent to percent and the return on investment weighting was reduced to percent from percent this change was made to provide more emphasis on for all in view of the goal of improving line growth in light of the increase in the weighting of growth in the performance share plan growth was removed as performance measure from the us annual cash incentive plan for our executive as such fiscal annual cash incentive metrics will change to percent based on total company operating income and percent based on us operating income with his performance share metrics based on percent us and percent total company return on investment table of contents second restricted make up percent of the annual equity award for and traditionally have equally in the second fourth and fifth after grant after market data and the equity of our it was determined that five year vesting period was not competitive as such the the vesting schedule for the annual restricted stock grant to vest in three along with the performance this change is also intended to provide clarity to opportunity because the full annual equity value will be eligible to vest every three rather than over five year period what is the role of management and compensation with respect to neo compensation when and the compensation of our other than the the the performance of these provided by our and the provided by our chairman our people division and our as part of this process our his annual performance of the other with the when and the compensation of our our chairman with support from our people division and the chair of the our performance evaluation with the and to the regarding our compensation beginning in early through fiscal as the independent consultant on executive compensation and in and the compensation of our executive our effective with to form management historically engaged to perform variety of human and consulting and to engage to perform these in light of the merger on the unanimously to engage kay company kay company as its independent executive compensation consultant going forward kay as primary advisor to the during the term of engagement by the soon thereafter kay left kay company and pay governance the then engaged pay governance as its independent executive compensation consultant under the of its engagement pay governance directly and exclusively to the the sole authority to retain terminate and approve the of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting to without the approval of the how is peer group data used by the our company is the retailer by wide and significantly more extensive international than most publicly based as result the that simply neo compensation against retail industry index would not provide the with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our therefore the retail industry compensation survey data provided by hay group hay group and publicly available information for three peer to determine how our compensation to the compensation to in comparable at other since information regarding comparable to those of some of our is not available for many of the in our peer three peer plus the hay group retail industry compensation survey data in number of comparable to which our compensation could be the data when each among the various of compensation as general guide to ensure that the amount of to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation we did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative to any of these peer or to any particular of peer group when against them while the data is generally used for comparable we also review peer group data for retail for our who are vice or lead our operating these have significant and we believe that these are often comparable to at many of our peer group in addition from competitive standpoint it is more likely that our operating division would be for position rather than lateral move therefore we these compensation against that of within our retail peer table of contents retail industry survey this survey us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly retail with significant with annual exceeding approximately billion which were alimentation best buy wholesale club

these to be less significant than the above compensation the also an estimate of the compensation of each of our during prior fiscal as well as of the compensation that could be by our in future the this information in order to understand the compensation actually by each neo and to determine whether such compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention tally the also tally prepared by our people division these tally summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation and other the tally also quantify the that would be to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company what are our for stock and other equity option exercise we did not grant any stock to our during fiscal and stock are not currently part of our executive compensation program the may grant stock in the future in special when we grant stock the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant timing of equity the each to approve and grant annual equity to our for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these equity for an upcoming fiscal year are in the executive compensation tables in this proxy statement as during the prior fiscal year the again in and or march to establish the performance applicable to the performance and any other performance based equity at the meeting any special equity to executive during the year are by the at meeting or by unanimous written consent does the take tax into account when designing executive compensation yes section of the internal revenue code that compensation in excess of to certain of our is generally not deductible unless it is performance based significant portion of the compensation to our table of contents the for under section when designing neo compensation the whether particular of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax the the ability to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax similarly the the ability to require an neo to defer into the future any compensation that is not deductible under federal tax do we have employment with our we do not have employment with any of our all are employed on an at will basis do we have severance with our we have into post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement that if we terminate the employment for any reason other than his violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two the base salary one fourth of which is upon termination of employment and the balance of which is in six after separation under these each neo agreed that for two year period following his termination of employment he will not participate in business that with us and will not solicit our for employment in this context business generally any retail wholesale or business that of the type sold by these reduce the risk that any of our former would use the and knowledge they while with us for the benefit of one of our during reasonable period after leaving our company in connection with his retirement from the company we into retirement agreement with see potential upon termination or change in control what of retirement and other are our eligible for our are eligible for the same retirement as our generally such as participation in our deferred compensation plan they may also take advantage of other available more broadly to our such as our plan and our which is non qualified non defined benefit plan in which all in the participate to the extent the internal revenue code the we would ordinarily contribute for their benefit under our plan our do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan does our compensation program contain any the recovery or nonpayment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our cash incentive plan that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have with our our statement of ethics at all it further that if the within twelve following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award participant any of our or otherwise detrimental to the best of our company the recipient must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan that if the that an associate any act detrimental to the best of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised and unvested of restricted stock and performance are our subject to any minimum regarding ownership of our stock to further the long term of our and our our board the following stock ownership our must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted equal in market value to five his current annual base salary and each of our other executive and certain other must beginning on the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to position covered by the stock ownership maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted equal in market value to three his or her current annual base salary if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in table of contents compliance with such until such time as he or she is in compliance with the and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the the board or the can modify these in the event of dramatic and unexpected in the market value of our or in other that the board or the deem appropriate are there any on the ability of to engage in speculative company stock yes other than pursuant to rule plan that been by our legal department our insider trading policy to trade in our stock only during open window and only after they have moreover may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange or or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative that speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial against the financial of our company risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share plan we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation generally reward mix of different performance namely earnings based based and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share plan are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating division to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain under which may be or if the recipient not with our our statement of ethics or detrimental to the best of our company table of contents summary compensation the

the company provide report semi annually its and for political and both direct and indirect made with corporate funds monetary and non monetary and direct and indirect used to participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office and used in any attempt to influence the general public or thereof with respect to or referenda the report

table of contents stockholder supporting statement as long term of the company we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political these include any considered intervention in any political campaign under the internal revenue code such as direct and indirect political to political or political independent or on behalf of federal state or local disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and its and critical for compliance with federal ethics moreover the supreme united decision the importance of political spending disclosure for when it said and to react to the speech of corporate in proper way this transparency the electorate to make informed and give proper weight to different and in transparency and accountability may expose the company to and business that could threaten long term shareholder value the company at least million in corporate funds since the election cycle home do and national institute on money in state politics index however on publicly available data does not provide complete picture of the political for example the to trade used for political are undisclosed and unknown in many even management does not know how trade use their money politically the proposal the company to disclose all of its political spending to trade and other tax exempt for political this would bring our company in line with growing number of leading electric power and that support political disclosure and accountability and present this information on their we urge your support for this critical governance reform statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political consistent with the federal state and local governing such we are fully to with all concerning political public disclosure federal law currently from making directly to for

and political also are subject to regulation although some have not corporate to or political all require that such be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available as result of the by law the board that ample disclosure regarding our political to alleviate the in this proposal in addition the board that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution would place our company at competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business and we are also involved in number of legislative that could dramatically affect our business and because with adverse also participate in the political process for their own business any unilaterally expanded disclosure by could benefit these to the detriment of and its for the above the board that the vote against this proposal table of contents proposal no special resolved ask our board to take the necessary unilaterally to the extent permitted by law to amend our and each appropriate governing document to give of of our outstanding common stock or the percentage permitted by law above the power to call special meeting this that such bylaw and or charter will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language in regard to calling special meeting that apply only to but not to management and or the board to the extent permitted by law special allow to vote on important such as that can arise between annual if can not call special management may become insulated and investor may suffer input on the timing of is especially important during major when unfold quickly and may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal does not impact our current power to call special meeting this proposal topic won more than support at sprint and the leading were nick and the merit of this special meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for improvement in our corporate governance status the corporate library an independent investment research firm rated our company with high governance risk and very high concern for executive pay million for duke and to million each for wright and the corporate library said executive incentive pay poorly structured the executive pay committee had discretion to increase cash to above the target the corporate library said our performance based equity should be for at least five year period not plus our executive equity pay should have performance vesting in order to assure full alignment with shareholder our company high governance risk due to poor executive pay our status as firm the ownership of almost half of our company and related party with of the board management and their daft and wolf were the only from our who were on our combination committee for and executive pay daft and wolf also our highest negative we also had two inside and inside related independence it is important that our future bring the right experience to our company however steven first to our board in experience from two rated please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal special yes on statement in opposition to proposal no the board that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best of our company or its consistent with corporate law our provide that special meeting of may be by majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for public company of our because it our board according to its fiduciary to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best of to convene special meeting with as little as ten percent of the outstanding to call special for any reason and at any time could result in special that are not in the best of our company and all of its we take very seriously and take to provide with access to our making our available via holding special meeting of our would be costly undertaking involve substantial and require us to commit significant and attention to the legal and logistical of such meeting for example we would incur legal printing and associated with and the disclosure for special meeting table of contents the board also that our governance and provide with access to the board and of senior management and offer ample opportunity for to express their to management these governance include the annual election of all board and majority voting requirement for the election of in addition may submit shareholder which if appropriate under the may be included in our annual proxy statement and on at our annual meeting furthermore the governing listed on the and incorporated under law require us to submit certain to vote of for approval such as large share or similar and the approval of equity based compensation for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no require supplier to publish an annual report whereas the un global compact to embrace support and enact within their sphere of influence set of core in the of human labor the environment and anti corruption and whereas the un global compact study era of found that the integration of into supply as the most significant performance gap in and whereas in order to ensure that in their supply chain are safe and fairly with respect and dignity some have established supplier code of conduct by drawing on internationally and whereas study by and corporate on labor and human in global supply pension and capital stewardship project labor and work life program law school found significant gap between general against labor and human abuse and more detailed and enforcement to carry them out and whereas given the merit of the old adage what measured done the long term of would be better if were to require their to establish performance on human and worker and to measure and publicly report on performance internationally and measurement and whereas in order to increase transparency and to improve performance such should include non compliance taken to remedy those and taken to contribute to the long term prevention or mitigation of such and other of concern therefore be it resolved the request that the board of take the necessary to require that the supplier publish annually an independently verifiable report among other important such report should include the objective and of performance on workplace safety and human and worker internationally and measurement in addition report should include of non compliance taken to remedy those and taken to contribute to long term prevention and mitigation statement in support best opportunity for early identification and mitigation of the by the human and labor of its is its development and rigorous implementation of risk management framework to enable its and verification of its performance against internationally of human and labor measurable and verifiable of performance an annual requirement of its supplier would strengthen the ability to assess its performance to hold its accountable help to drive performance and enable to better understand and assess potential and or operational statement in opposition to proposal no we have worked hard to be leader in and social responsibility for had in place supplier that address the treatment of by and supplier workplace safety we expect our to meet or exceed these our supplier are not merely that we encourage our to meet rather failure to adhere to these may jeopardize that continued business relationship with table of contents in furtherance of our for each year through internal or through qualified third party of of the of of for which is the importer of record and of of private branded if an audit that supplier is not with our we take appropriate action to address the problem up to and termination of our relationship with the supplier or its non factory and to work daily to implement that serve what to be the ultimate purpose of the proposal that is to purchase from that comply with high of legal and ethical treatment of and workplace safety we believe that our to produce annual would force our to incur significant expense in connection with the commitment of necessary to prepare and publish such this requirement and the by our in these could ultimately lead to higher for and higher for our this would not be in the best of and and would place at competitive disadvantage against those whose supplier bases are not to incur the associated with annual for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no climate change risk disclosure resolved mart request that the board of prepare by at reasonable expense and proprietary information report the business related to climate change which may include impact of legislation and regulation impact of international indirect of regulation or business physical of climate change supporting statement as interpretive guidance provided by the and exchange commission on pointed out legal technological political and scientific regarding climate change may create or for mart itself to dramatic to reduce carbon and to support controversial political even as scientific and political related to global warming are rapidly and from the climatic research unit of the university of east in late exposed in the reliability and objectivity of key information provided to the united influential intergovernmental panel on climate change in the acknowledged its prize winning report on global warming included and exaggerated based on questionable data according to the mart report currently we are supporting legislation in the to reduce greenhouse gas the enactment of well designed cap and trade system as the the people overwhelmingly cap and trade in west successful democratic senate candidate joe ran ad in which he picked up rifle and used copy of the cap and trade bill for target practice on mart to eliminate million metric of from its global supply chain by the end of thus imposing its political agenda on its on its mart its broad environmental include to be percent by renewable energy to create zero waste these are neither achievable nor desirable they move mart beyond political correctness into the realm of the absurd the of climate change through this report may help mart avoid future embarrassment table of contents statement in opposition to proposal no is to serving our our our and our as part of that commitment we take pride in our leadership in corporate environmental our experience that our to reduce the direct and indirect effects of our business on the environment are beneficial for our business our and the that we serve we regularly consider the that climate may pose for our business not only as part of our but also as part of our business around the world in accordance with recent sec we publicly disclose to our business by weather whether as result of climate change or otherwise the most recent disclosure of such is in the risk section of our annual report on form for fiscal because already potential material to our business by climate and other and those annually to our we believe that report of the type by the proposal
