with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve primarily resulting from the billion net loss in fiscal related to the sale of the majority stake in brazil and net unrealized loss on our

lapping the and impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the denominator relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition was largely offset by the decrease in average capital resulting from the removal of the eight rent factor upon adoption of as operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets we define roi as operating income operating income

capitalization of our operating because the lease standard was adopted prospectively as of our calculation of roi for the comparable fiscal period was not recast our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how
