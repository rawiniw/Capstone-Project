discuss certain performance metrics that management to assess the company performance additionally the discussion information about the financial of the three of our business to provide better understanding of how each of those and its of affect the financial condition and of of the company as whole throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and of we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club and other management the of the company each segment operating income certain corporate overhead as well as other from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment operating income certain corporate overhead and other as determined by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period and are to conform to the current period presentation the disclosed for corporate and support in the leverage discussion of the company performance metrics consist of corporate overhead and other not to any of the company table of store and club is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as commerce we measure the commerce impact by those through our and through our commerce distribution as well as an estimate for but through our and in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to understand better underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense have been among to be comparable with the current period presentation company performance performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and our priority of growth on through comparable store and club commerce and unit square growth the priority of leverage our objective to increase our operating income at the same rate as or faster rate than the growth in net by growing our operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of our net and the priority of on how efficiently we employ assets through return on investment and how effectively we manage working capital through free cash flow while all three are important our priority is growth with investment in commerce growth will contribute to improving leverage and over time ended nine ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for the three and nine respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year the in net were primarily due to year over year growth in retail square higher commerce across the company and positive comparable in the these were partially offset by negative impact from in currency exchange for the three and nine respectively table of comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and nine and were as three ended nine ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel for and for when to the same in the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club were positively impacted by an increase in average ticket primarily due to inflation in several partially offset by the reduction in government food for the three and nine severe winter which during the first quarter of fiscal also had negative impact for the nine commerce positively impacted comparable approximately for both and sam club for each of the three and nine table of ended nine ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe both the growth of our operating and our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at the same rate as or faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three and nine operating and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year accordingly we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net for either period higher health care in the from enrollment and medical cost inflation as well as continued in commerce and other were the primary that us not to leverage for the three and nine in addition severe winter in the to the increase in operating as percentage of net for the nine operating the three and nine we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at the same rate or faster rate than net as operating income and respectively while net and respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the we for not operating as well as lower gross profit rate primarily from price at and the cash program at sam club table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to decrease in operating income as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and commerce we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the nine to free cash flow of the nine the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of for income and capital additionally definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our condensed consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information

of segment net for the nine table of and capital strength and stability of our have historically us with significant source of liquidity cash provided by operating with long term debt and short term have been sufficient to fund our while us to continue to grow our by in global expansion generally some or all of the available cash flow been used to fund the on our common stock and share we believe

and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in net cash used in for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow net cash provided by operating cash provided by operating was the nine and respectively the increase in net cash provided by operating was primarily due to the timing of for income and the combination of normal in other operating cash and working and cash were and respectively our working capital deficit was and respectively the decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily the result of less net cash provided by operating for share during the nine ended which us to reduce our short term also to the decrease were higher inventory in each of our primarily from lower than and store growth we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in consistent access to the capital and in providing to our in the form of share and of cash we use intercompany in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through other ongoing cash from external or both accordingly we intend with only certain to continue to indefinitely reinvest our cash and cash outside of the in our foreign when the income is either from or through intercompany and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the within our foreign could be to the although any repatriation under current tax would be subject to federal income less applicable foreign tax as of and cash and cash of approximately billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the due to local or other we do not expect local other or potential on future of cash outside of the to have material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or of table of cash used in cash used in was the nine and respectively and generally of to build remodel expand our commerce and invest in other net cash used in billion for the nine when to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to the timing of our capital as well as proceeds received from the disposal of certain further below our plan is for our fiscal capital to be similar to actual capital for fiscal therefore we expect that greater portion of our capital will occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are working to significantly increase the number of neighborhood in the and accelerate the expansion of our commerce as in note to our condensed consolidated financial we the sale of the restaurant business in on may we received cash in connection with the sale which is reflected in cash from net cash used in cash used in was the nine and respectively and generally of activity in our short term and long term debt stock and with noncontrolling net cash used in billion for the nine when to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to the reduction in short term and the activity further below short term term the nine to an increase of the same period in the previous fiscal year we generally utilize the liquidity provided by short term to provide used for our dividend share capital and other cash however we have made share this fiscal year which us to reduce our short term additionally more cash provided from operating combined with less cash used for capital during the nine us to minimize our short term at our various of credit remain mostly unused and continue to provide more than billion of additional liquidity if long term following table the in our long term debt for the nine in millions long term debt due within one yearlong term as of proceeds from long term debt of long term debt of long term debt other as of the net of proceeds from and of our long term debt during the nine was billion to billion during the same period in the previous fiscal year this difference is primarily due to the timing and of and as well as our desire to

repurchase activity with noncontrolling in note to our condensed consolidated financial during the nine we the purchase of substantially all of the noncontrolling interest in chile for approximately billion we used cash to complete this transaction which is reflected in cash used in table of believe cash from our current cash position and access to debt capital will continue to be sufficient to meet our operating cash needs seasonal in merchandise and to fund our capital dividend and share we have strong commercial paper and long term debt that have and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable in debt capital at the assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long term debt were as rating poor sa aa fitch rating review their periodically and therefore the credit assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit will remain consistent over time that could affect our credit include in our operating performance the general economic environment in the retail industry our financial position our total debt and capitalization and in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit by credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing or impair our ability to access capital and credit on commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current short term credit could impair our ability to access the commercial paper with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially us to rely more heavily on more expensive of debt the credit rating agency are not to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term we consider various qualitative and quantitative we monitor the ratio of our debt to total capitalization as support for our long term for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term long term debt due within one year under capital due within one year long term debt and long term under capital total capitalization is defined as debt plus total equity at and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively the decrease in our debt to total capitalization ratio was primarily due to less cash for share which us to reduce our short term and growth in
