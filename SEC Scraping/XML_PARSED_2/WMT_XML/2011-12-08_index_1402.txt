the of its among other each operating income certain corporate overhead from time to time we revise the measurement of each operating income any corporate overhead as by the information regularly by our when we do so the prior period for segment operating income are to conform to the current presentation the other in the leverage discussion of the performance metrics are primarily corporate overhead comparable store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in the consolidated and operating of our international segment we sometimes refer to the effect of in currency exchange when we refer to in currency exchange or currency exchange rate we are to the between the currency exchange we use to translate the international financial from local into for financial the of currency exchange rate are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity the current currency exchange and the comparable prior year currency exchange respectively we use this method for all where the functional currency is not in the dollar company performance metrics the performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and table of contents the priority of growth on through comparable store or club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow growth net millions net net net net club net our consolidated net and for the three and nine ended respectively when to the three and nine ended the increase in net for the three and nine ended was attributable to growth in retail square and currency translation currency translation for billion and billion of the increase in net for the three and nine ended respectively while in our international segment for billion and billion respectively of the net increase over the comparable volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future our continued expansion resulting in year over year growth in retail square to an increase in net in addition during the three ended the company had positive comparable calendar comparable store and club the company calendar comparable store and club for the three and nine ended and as with fuel fuel impact with fuel fuel impact club total leverage operating income dollar in millions international club other total operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and table of contents leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net operating for the three and nine ended operating and respectively when to the same in the prior year while net and over the same respectively other overhead have for the three and nine month ended our global to the majority of the increase in operating as we continue to invest in our commerce depreciation expense year over year based on our financial system with the remainder of the increase driven by multiple none of which were individually significant for the three and nine ended we operating operating income our operating income grew by and for the three and nine ended respectively when to the same in the prior year while net by and for the three and nine respectively over the prior year although operating income for the three and nine month we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net our gross profit declined primarily due to the impact of price and cost inflation while we operating operating income for the three and nine ended included currency translation benefit of million and million respectively from the international segment volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the operating income in the future return on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing month ended and respectively the majority of the decline in roi was attributable to in the second quarter of the current fiscal year we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less payable and for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is income from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets from for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating roi as result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other the calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as table of contents dollar in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income denominator average total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from denominator average total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet data total assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on only and therefore the impact of total assets as of and in the table above exclude assets of that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of billion and billion for the nine ended and respectively free cash flow due to million increase in cash from operating partially offset by an approximately million increase in capital free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for table of contents discretionary due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our entire of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating measure which we believe to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in net cash used in of the following discussion of our of is based on our and therefore any or discussion of our consolidated of three and nine

as percentage of net unit retail square our consolidated net and for the three and nine ended respectively when to the three and nine ended the increase in net for the three and nine ended was attributable to growth in retail square and currency translation currency translation for billion and billion of the increase in net for the three and nine ended respectively while in our international segment for billion and billion respectively of the net increase over the comparable volatility in currency exchange may continue to impact the net in the future our continued expansion resulting in year over year growth in retail square to an increase in net in addition during the three ended the company had positive comparable our gross profit as percentage of net gross profit for the three and nine ended declined and basis respectively when to the same in the prior year all three decline in gross profit during the three ended primarily due to the impact of price investment and cost inflation operating as percentage of net were and for the three and nine ended respectively and and for the three and nine ended respectively the company table of contents for the three and nine ended with all three to the expense leverage for the three ended our effective income tax rate was and for the three and nine ended respectively and and for the three and nine ended respectively the in the effective tax rate were primarily attributable to million tax benefit related to in transfer in foreign tax jurisdiction during the three and nine ended we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be at the lower end of our previously disclosed range of to significant that may impact our effective income tax rate include in our assessment of certain tax the impact of discrete and the mix of earnings among our and international where the statutory are generally lower than the statutory rate as result of the above we billion and billion of income from for the three and nine ended respectively and billion and billion for the three and nine ended respectively segment three and nine ended and three nine in millions except unit net percentage change from comparable period calendar comparable store operating income operating income as percentage of net unit retail square net for the segment and during the three and nine ended respectively when to the three and nine ended the increase in net for the three ended was primarily due to increase in year over year retail square and an increase in comparable store due to average ticket partially offset by decline in customer traffic the increase in net for the nine ended was primarily due to increase in year over year retail square partially offset by decline in comparable store the decline in comparable store for the nine ended from reduction in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in average ticket gross profit declined slightly and was relatively flat for the three and nine ended respectively to the same in the prior year the slight decline in gross profit during the three month period was primarily due to our focus on our price investment strategy to lower retail price on numerous merchandise throughout the segment and higher cost inflation that was not on to our operating as percentage of segment net declined slightly during the three and nine ended to the same in the prior year primarily due to labor productivity and our focus on cost control table of contents international segment three and nine ended and three nine in millions except unit net percentage change from
