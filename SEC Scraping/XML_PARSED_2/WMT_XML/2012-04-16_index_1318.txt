as to which they hold in their discretion executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis executive summary in the following we discuss how our and certain other executive our executive or were in fiscal through and describe how this compensation within our executive compensation philosophy our financial performance for fiscal was solid our earnings were in the half of our annual guidance provided at the beginning of fiscal when our incentive were set the us segment positive comparable store for the fiscal year and us over the course of the year with consecutive fiscal quarters of positive comparable store in the third and fourth quarters international to deliver strong growth and club sustained its momentum with continued strong and operating income our company continued to leverage and our return on investment roi continued to be relatively stable with roi for fiscal moderately less than the prior fiscal year primarily due to additional in property plant and equipment global and higher as well as in price our stock price more than percent during fiscal and we of per share during the fiscal year for total of approximately billion in we also returned an additional billion to in the form of share the key financial on which our incentive compensation are based are operating income and roi despite our strong earnings performance and relatively stable in fiscal with the exception of our club division our overall fiscal performance was below the established by the for our executive compensation in which our participate in particular with the exception of club our operating income fell short of the target performance under our cash incentive plan and our and roi fell short of the target performance under our long term equity incentive program this performance directly impacted our compensation for fiscal in particular each of our cash incentive payment that was below target for fiscal and our cash incentive payment was approximately percent less than his cash incentive payment for the prior fiscal year similarly with the exception of who was responsible for our club segment in fiscal our long term equity incentive for fiscal was reduced because we determine long term equity based on performance over three these will be reduced for the next two fiscal as well our compensation program performance our total direct compensation for base salary annual cash and long term equity are heavily weighted towards performance base salary less than percent of each target opportunity approximately percent for the and substantial majority at least percent of each target opportunity is contingent on meeting operating income and roi that we believe have meaningful impact on shareholder value our annual cash incentive is based primarily on the operating income of our company and or one or more operating depending on each our long term performance share program is based on total company roi and the performance of one or more operating depending on each area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and the balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating financial performance and shareholder value and the risk that our will overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of our company as whole in addition our executive compensation program to balance long term and annual performance our annual cash incentive plan is primarily based on operating income during single fiscal year while our long term performance share program is based on and roi over three year period with performance set annually and table of contents based on the average performance against these during each of the three our also receive service based restricted stock restricted stock in as part of our annual equity on the third anniversary of the grant date along with performance restricted stock our ownership in the company as well as serving as retention tool the regularly our executive compensation to ensure that compensation is competitive but remains closely tied to performance that can be impacted by our and that the is with shareholder value in addition the that the and of our performance based compensation are in light of the of and our to our and other as well as the internal of the board and our company our incentive during fiscal the compensation by our for fiscal that our incentive are working as designed while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was below the fiscal target under our annual cash incentive plan as result our cash incentive payment for fiscal was approximately million which was significantly less than his target of million this to cash incentive payment of million to our for fiscal and maximum cash incentive payment of million to our for fiscal with respect to our long term performance share program our roi relatively stable but was below the target performance goal under this plan and our performance also fell short of our target performance under this plan with the exception of club which its for fiscal under this plan as result with respect to the portion of performance dependent on fiscal performance our approximately percent less than his target opportunity to approximately percent less than his target opportunity in fiscal and approximately percent above target in fiscal because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only did this result in lower performance share for fiscal but it will also adversely impact our performance share for fiscal and fiscal who are the executive covered in this proxy statement for fiscal our were duke president and duke our company in and in number of prior to becoming president and in executive vice president and our company in and was to on executive vice president president and us our company in and was to his present position on june executive vice president president and international our company in and was to his current position in former executive vice president president and club our company in and resigned as president and of club on as an executive vice president of our company in transitional role through march executive vice president president and global our company on our company less than one month before the end of fiscal however because received his initial annual equity award in prior to the end of fiscal is an neo for fiscal due primarily to the value of this annual equity award did not receive cash incentive or long term performance share for fiscal we have voluntarily included as neo because he led our club segment during fiscal table of contents impact of fiscal performance on executive compensation how was fiscal performance reflected in our executive compensation cash incentive plan while our fiscal earnings performance was strong operating income for the total company as well as for the us and international was below the fiscal target performance under our annual cash incentive plan as result our cash incentive payment for fiscal was less than the target with the exception of who was not eligible for cash incentive for fiscal each of our other also received cash incentive that was below target moreover because our growth in operating income during fiscal was not as strong relative to our performance as it was in the prior two our less under our annual cash incentive plan for fiscal than for each of the prior two with the exception of whose percentage was slightly higher and whose cash incentive opportunity was greater in fiscal than in prior as below the following table our fiscal fiscal and fiscal under our cash incentive plan company division fiscal of target fiscal of target fiscal of target total company us international club as result our who continued in the same with the same cash incentive smaller cash incentive payment for fiscal as to the previous two fiscal for example our cash incentive payment for fiscal that was almost million less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal and approximately million less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal when he received maximum under the plan duke cash incentive fiscal year of target cash performance with respect to our long term performance share program our roi was below the target performance goal under our long term incentive plan our performance for the total company and the us and international also fell short of our target performance under this plan as result as shown in the table below we fell short of our target performance share applicable to each of our with the exception of who was responsible for our club because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only did this result in lower performance share for fiscal but it will also adversely impact our performance share for fiscal and fiscal performance company division fiscal of target fiscal of target fiscal of target total company us international club as result of our fiscal performance the combined value of performance share for fiscal fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million less than if we had our target performance share for fiscal assuming stock price of per share which was the price of on the on actual performance share to our for the three year period ended are shown below on page table of contents fiscal performance and performance what performance metrics were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal commensurate with the philosophy our fiscal was substantially performance based each performance are based on the performance of our total company or combination of the performance of our total company and the operating division this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating based on performance within their control or influence while still tying significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company to drive the business the performance applicable to our fiscal compensation were element of compensation fiscal performance metrics annual cash incentive operating income total company and or division performance total company return on investment total company for duke and us for international for club for for of the performance we define return on investment which is non measure as defined in the as operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from for the fiscal year or trailing twelve divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus depreciation and amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight the chose these performance to with the strategic of growth leverage and the that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to our to achieve performance that is in line with the best of our company and our in addition the that the combination and weighting of these performance metrics help to mitigate the risk that our would be to pursue with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as whole for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive what were our specific performance for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to these in actual performance for of our performance based the made certain positive and negative to our as provided by the of the applicable these are intended to enable for particular fiscal year to be on comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our incentive reward underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of our for fiscal operating income and roi were to exclude the net effect of recent currency exchange rate natural disaster related the sale of real estate in brazil and

performance share award table of contents how much of our was performance based in fiscal for fiscal base salary less than percent of each target opportunity and substantial majority of each target opportunity was comprised of an annual cash incentive and performance that is compensation that is contingent on satisfying balance of performance that we believe have meaningful impact on shareholder value as shown in the following is not included above because he our company at the end of fiscal what other of compensation did our receive for fiscal our may from time to time receive special special are typically for retention or in recognition of extraordinary performance because these are not part of an annual compensation the special are not included in in march the special performance based cash award opportunity for in the amount of million in order for to earn this award club total excluding fuel had to increase by at least percent during fiscal the purpose of this award was to emphasize the importance of continued strong performance during fiscal total for club excluding fuel by approximately percent as result the award in full the special performance based cash award is included on the summary compensation table in fiscal compensation since it was for that period what and other do our receive our receive limited number of and supplemental we cover the cost of annual

participation in the plan medical and foreign business travel insurance we provide these and supplemental to attract talented to our company and to retain our current fiscal total direct compensation opportunity what was the for the in fiscal and the other covered in the summary compensation table the following table the established for each neo for the fiscal on the summary compensation table rounded to the nearest thousand as shown in the table below target the our would receive if target performance are maximum the that our would receive if maximum performance are and is therefore intended to reflect the our would receive only in the event of exceptional performance executive officer annual cash incentive total cash equity target target target target duke as above because our overall performance during fiscal was not as strong as our performance during the prior two fiscal our less of their opportunity during fiscal as to prior fiscal why is different than the shown in the summary compensation table inclusion of the table above is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the decision making process when neo compensation the summary compensation table that on page specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal for our in the manner by sec the in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation by the for our nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation that may actually be by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance for example because the typically annual equity to our prior to the start of the fiscal year the equity for fiscal appear on the summary compensation table as part of fiscal compensation as noted above received equity in that are included on the summary compensation table for fiscal but are intended as part of ashes fiscal table of contents what were the significant to our compensation for fiscal there were no significant to the basic structure for in fiscal after us component in cash incentive award in fiscal cash incentive for fiscal was based on operating income as it is for our other senior and most management generally in making this change the that significant portion of is already dependent on us by of our long term performance share program for fiscal our received base salary ranging from approximately percent to approximately percent which is consistent with annual base salary for management generally for fiscal target cash incentive award from percent to percent of his base salary this increase reflected continued experience in his leadership role and was intended to cash incentive opportunity with other internal and external peer how is between annual and long term compensation majority of each fiscal was to performance which have three year performance period an additional portion of fiscal was to restricted stock which on the third anniversary of the grant date the following illustrate this allocation for our and for our other as group the may not total due to rounding we believe that this mix appropriately annual and long term performance executive compensation philosophy and process who the at the is the board committee that is responsible for and the compensation of the subject to section the and other the of the are independent see and for more information on the the met seven in fiscal during each of these the considered executive compensation the review and approval of compensation for our the selection of performance metrics and performance applicable to the performance based compensation and the review of performance against those metrics what is the compensation philosophy in the philosophy is that substantial portion of should be tied to performance that the business and that each neo can impact this philosophy on the long term of table of contents and to the of the with the continued growth and long term performance this philosophy the the executive compensation program to provide fair competitive compensation based on performance and to the company provide to attract and retain key instill long term commitment to the company and develop sense of company ownership how does the establish the process of setting is dynamic one the among other the overall financial and operating performance of our company and operating as applicable each individual performance and to the achievement of financial and operational each job historical compensation and and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each potential to assume greater in the future the peer group data and analyses see for more detail and the of recent shareholder advisory on executive compensation generally our target which would be if target performance are place the in the quartile of the peer for their respective the that it is generally appropriate to position our target at this level because as the retailer the extensive international presence and complex result in our neo greater level of complexity than similar at many of our peer group the target opportunity for executive may be less than the quartile of the peer depending on number of particularly time and experience in similar role in individual performance the on annual performance for each neo and with the supervisor the in among our are due to many these include the in job scope and the review of peer group compensation information through peer and of experience historical compensation retention and succession and individual and where relevant divisional performance the set forth in the table on page represent the judgment as to the appropriate compensation in light of these how is among the various of compensation base salary in keeping with our philosophy that substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the typically relatively small percentage of to base salary because our more senior typically have large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our advance in our company annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management our are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment the target opportunity for the annual cash incentive is based on percentage of base salary the cash incentive can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our target opportunity is percent of his base salary and he can earn cash incentive from percent of his base salary at threshold to maximum of percent of his base salary the cash incentive on whether we achieve established performance and no will be made unless the threshold performance are met the the performance in the first quarter of the fiscal year long term equity the balance of generally the portion is then between two of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity help the of our with the of our as well as providing retention tool consistent with our philosophy of tying table of contents compensation to performance percent of the annual equity award is in the form of performance with the percent in the form of restricted stock performance performance share award the officer it the right to receive number of if we meet certain performance during performance period generally performance to our have three year performance period with the performance metrics set annually by the the number of received at is based on the average performance as to these performance metrics over three fiscal the can earn from percent at threshold to maximum of percent of the target number of restricted stock the percent of the equity value is in the form of restricted stock which for annual in fiscal on the third anniversary of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting date how does the set performance the for our performance based are established in light of the operating for our company and each of its operating the operating to reach our strategic are by the board in light of economic in our industry and in the in which we operate the operating are generally intended to be and fiscal was no exception particularly given the economic environment for our core customer in order to achieve the target in our performance based our company and operating must perform in line with our operating income and return on investment and operating at the time the were set in order to achieve the maximum the performance of our company and operating would have to exceed those to significant degree generally for our international division require greater in operating income and relative to our other this our strategic growth for our international in light of market and the level of capital investment for growth in the international in which we operate the generally to set the threshold and maximum performance so that consistent level of difficulty in these is from year to year the generally the maximum performance at level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance at level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify payment do our receive any compensation that is not included in on occasion we grant our our special that are not included in these are generally in the form of performance based restricted stock or service based restricted stock and are intended for retention and or to reward exceptional performance also the may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target for that neo based upon the subjective evaluation of that individual performance the did not increase or decrease any cash incentive payment for fiscal received special performance based cash award of million based on club performance during fiscal which is above on page our also receive limited and other as above on in the special performance based cash award opportunity for in the amount of million half of this award is contingent on meeting performance for fiscal and half is contingent on meeting performance for fiscal in march the established performance goal for fiscal applicable to this award the will establish performance goal or for the portion of this award contingent on fiscal performance at later date the purpose of this award was to allow the the ability to set separate strategic for which for fiscal is to continue to emphasize the importance of growth and for retention also in the million special restricted stock award to primarily for retention one half of this award will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and the other half will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date provided that to be employed by through the vesting finally as is customary for officer in the two performance share to that were in addition to his annual performance share award that is table of contents to vest on these additional performance share are to vest on and respectively and each target value of million which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share award in addition as above our receive other generally available to our such as participation in our plan our stock purchase plan and other available to our such as our deferred compensation plan our also receive certain and supplemental above other compensation are there any significant to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged in march the established performance metrics and for the fiscal performance based for fiscal our executive incentive compensation continue to be based on operating income and roi metrics what is the role of management and compensation with respect to neo compensation when and the compensation of our other than the the the performance of these provided by our and the provided by our chairman our global people division and our as part of this process our his annual performance of the other with the when and the compensation of our our chairman with support from our global people division and the chair of the our performance evaluation with the and to the regarding our compensation since early the engaged an independent consultant on executive compensation since early pay governance pay governance been engaged by the as its independent executive compensation consultant under the of its engagement pay governance directly and exclusively to the the sole authority to retain terminate and approve the of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting to without the approval of the other than its engagement by the pay governance does not perform any for the independent consultant and in at which executive compensation are considered and analyses for the at the request realizable pay analysis analysis of the correlation between performance metrics and shareholder return and of the difficulty of performance how is peer group data used by the our company is the retailer by wide and significantly more extensive international than most publicly based as result the that simply neo compensation against retail industry index would not provide the with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our therefore the publicly available information for three peer to determine how our compensation to the compensation to in comparable at other since information regarding comparable to those of some of our is not available for many of the in our peer three peer in number of comparable to which our compensation can be the data when each among the various of compensation as general guide to ensure that the amount of to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation we did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative to any of these peer or to any particular of peer group when against them while the data is generally used for comparable the also peer group data for retail for our who lead our operating these have significant and the that these are often comparable to at many of our table of contents peer group in addition from competitive standpoint it is more likely that our operating segment would be for position rather than lateral move therefore we these compensation against that of within our retail peer retail industry survey this survey us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all

information in the process of setting although the generally these to be less significant than the above compensation the also an estimate of the compensation of each of our during prior fiscal as well as of the compensation that could be by our in future the this information in order to understand the compensation actually by each neo and to determine whether such compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention tally the also tally prepared by our global people division these tally summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation and other the tally also quantify the that would be to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company advisory shareholder on executive compensation at the annual meeting for the first time had an opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve our compensation at the annual meeting approximately percent of the cast on this proposal were to approve our compensation while this vote was not until after the had established our compensation for fiscal the that the of this vote support of our approach to executive compensation which as above not significantly since fiscal the considered that support when our compensation for fiscal based on the recommendation of the board our also overwhelmingly in favor of an annual advisory vote to approve our neo compensation and we have determined to hold such vote annually the will continue to consider the outcome of these annual advisory when making future compensation for our table of contents what are our for stock and other equity option exercise we did not grant any stock to our during fiscal and stock are not currently part of our executive compensation program the may grant stock in the future in special when we grant stock the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on

executive compensation tables in this proxy statement as during the prior fiscal year the again in and or march to establish the performance applicable to the performance and any other performance based equity at the meeting any special equity to executive during the year are by the at meeting or by unanimous written consent does the take tax into account when designing executive compensation

further that if the within twelve following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award participant any of our or otherwise detrimental to the best of our company the

only during open window and only after they have moreover may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange or or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative that speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial against the financial of our company risk in our compensation program the pursuant to its charter is responsible for and the compensation and structure applicable to our generally we do not believe that our compensation and for our give rise to that are reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following our compensation program is designed to provide mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our long term best our incentive compensation generally reward mix of different performance namely earnings related based and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase by that would negatively impact our profitability resulting in performance share should be offset by in annual cash incentive table of contents maximum under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target respectively we believe that these mitigate excessive risk taking because the maximum amount that can be in single cycle is limited significant percentage of our incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue that might maximize the performance of single operating division to the detriment of our company as whole our senior are subject to stock ownership which we believe our to consider the long term of our company and our and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation are designed with that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep that might encourage short term business in order to meet threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain under which may be or if the recipient not with our our statement of ethics or

liaison to the board of southwest th street some of the shareholder contain about or other that our company are incorrect but we have not to refute all of those in our of opposition following these the board vote against each of the following shareholder based on policy as set forth in in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no political report resolved that the of mart mart or company hereby request that the company provide report semi annually the that the company or in connection with legislation or in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office and to influence the general public or thereof with respect to legislative or referenda the report should include to or on behalf of political political political and other political and the of any or other that are made to tax exempt organization for an expenditure or contribution that if made directly by the company would not be deductible under section of the internal revenue code the report should identify each recipient the amount to each and the purpose of any contribution or expenditure stockholder supporting statement as long term of mart we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on and political the upon which we seek report are those that congress said do not warrant deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense namely participation in the political system by supporting or opposing for office and trying to influence the general public or segment thereof as to legislative or referenda this to third trade and other tax exempt which are used for that would not be deductible if made by the company itself disclosure is consistent with public policy and we believe in the best interest of the company and its the supreme united decision the importance of political spending disclosure when it said and to react to the speech of corporate in proper way this transparency the electorate to make informed and give proper weight to different and in transparency and accountability may expose the company to and business that could threaten long term shareholder value moreover publicly available data does not provide complete picture of the or political thus the to trade for these are undisclosed and unknown as are any to tax exempt that work to influence legislation and political as well as public opinion that could affect legislation or the involved can be significant story that several health donated million to the chamber of commerce in for polling and to drum up opposition to health care reform legislation former federal election commission chairman this figure as we believe that need disclosure in order to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets on these thus we urge you to vote for this critical governance reform table of contents statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political consistent with the federal state and local governing such we are fully to with all concerning political public disclosure federal law currently from

level both and political also are subject to regulation although some have not corporate to or political all require that such be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available as result of the by law the board that ample disclosure regarding our political to alleviate the in this proposal in addition the board that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution would place our company at competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business and we are also involved in number of legislative that could dramatically affect our business and because with adverse also participate in the political process for their own business any unilaterally expanded disclosure by regarding its political or to trade and other tax exempt could benefit these to the detriment of and its for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no director nomination policy resolved that of mart urge the board of the board to adopt policy that the board based on the compensation and governance recommendation will nominate at least one director for election at each annual meeting at which are who is current or retired executive officer of company government agency or non profit organization in the sector and significant experience in patient safety and quality the policy should be prospectively

available at we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no as previously in this proxy statement under the heading nomination process for director the in rigorous and dynamic process for and potential and to the board for nomination for election to the board in discharging its to identify qualified and diverse for the board the regularly the composition of the board and its and whether the addition of one or more with particular experience or would make the board and its more effective to that end the the director candidate search consultant to seek out who have the experience and that the determined as necessary to serve as an effective member of the board as also previously in this proxy statement for nomination to the board are selected on the basis of outstanding achievement in their professional broad experience wisdom personal and professional integrity ability to make independent analytical experience with and understanding of the business environment willingness and ability to devote adequate time to board and such other experience and that the may determine as for service on the board ultimately when potential candidate the and the board consider the different and that candidate could bring to the board and how those and could enhance the execution of its the and the board recognize the importance of related and to our as well as the importance of many other and to our our board and the audit committee are fully engaged with management regarding the and with respect to risk assessment and management any potential pertaining to related and by our company we believe however that the policy in this shareholder proposal would unduly limit the ability of the and the board to review and select potential who in their judgment have the combination of experience and that are best to oversee the complex global business and oversee the company and its management in the strategic and business further already have an adequate for for nomination to the board whom believe have certain experience or that might benefit the company and its as under the heading nomination process for director in this proxy statement may follow the listed to recommend for nomination for election to the board who meet the minimum for director candidate as in this proxy statement all shareholder of potential board are to the for its review analysis and consideration table of contents and who are by and who meet the minimum in the proxy statement will be by the on the same basis as all other director for the above the board that the vote against this proposal proposal no report regarding incentive compensation resolved that of mart urge the board of the board to adopt policy that the compensation and governance committee the committee will annually analyze and report to at reasonable expense and proprietary information on whether incentive compensation and considered together provide appropriate to discourage senior from making that result in of return on investment taking into account the following over the previous three the relationship between growth in capital and growth in operating income in return on investment roi the relationship between same store growth also known as comparable store and total growth the made to in connection with the measurement of performance for performance based and the extent to which at open for more than one year declined because of at newly the cannibalization rate supporting statement as and long term we believe that incentive compensation and for senior should encourage sustainable value creation we are concerned that recent by the committee may overemphasize growth even when that growth is resulting in of return on investment and in some does not produce that cover the cost of capital specifically the replacement of same store metric repeatedly as critically total growth as the metric under performance share program encouraging senior to invest in even if doing so to cannibalization of and lower on investment during fiscal and same store and total growth in opposite and since the growth in capital been significantly greater than the growth in operating income our we also note that based on the rate of cannibalization significantly from approximately in to in in its proxy statement that the use of operating income growth for the annual incentive plan the and roi metrics used in the long term plan the operating income measure is to ensure that incentive reward underlying operational performance that are beyond the control of proxy statement at we disagree however that at least one adjustment listed in the for litigation beyond the control of senior this proposal the board to commit to policy that the committee will annually analyze and report to on whether incentive compensation encourage that result in on investment taking into account in our view such an analysis and report will focus the committee on that for senior promote long term value creation for we urge to vote for this proposal statement in opposition to proposal no the is responsible for among other and the attainment of performance under our performance based incentive compensation the of the discharge this responsibility with high degree of care and professionalism executive compensation incentive compensation at multiple throughout the year for example in fiscal the considered executive compensation the selection of performance metrics and performance applicable to table of contents our senior performance based compensation and the review of the performance against those metrics at seven separate the the incentive compensation and the behavior by those far more frequently than is by this shareholder proposal we believe that our incentive compensation provide appropriate to our senior to manage the company in manner that will help us achieve our strategic of growth leverage and and therefore maximize shareholder value as in the included in this proxy statement and in previous proxy the that the design of our performance based incentive compensation an appropriate balance between rewarding both annual and long term performance and the risk that our senior will make that overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of the company as whole reflecting the balanced approach taken in our incentive compensation return on investment roi is key performance measure used in the amount of incentive compensation our receive through our long term performance share plan even slight fluctuation in roi performance can lead to meaningful reduction in our performance share based incentive compensation as in the included in this proxy statement we fell short of our target roi goal under our long term incentive plan this with the exception of one of our in our falling short of target performance under our performance share plan in fiscal further because we average three separate of performance to determine the three year under our performance share program not only did this result in lower performance share for fiscal but it will also impact our performance share for fiscal and fiscal as well the importance of roi performance to our total compensation is in the narrative in the and is clearly in included in the in this proxy statement the through its regular review and approval of the performance applicable to performance based compensation already whether our incentive compensation appropriately our senior to achieve our strategic the strategic priority of the via the included in the annual proxy already to on an annual basis regarding the relationship between our incentive compensation and the roi performance and how the roi performance may have meaningful impact on the amount of compensation our receive commensurate with its the will continue to analyze whether the performance used in our incentive compensation properly our senior to achieve the strategic in light of the business strategy and consistent with the and of the sec the analyses of our incentive compensation will continue to be to in our annual proxy furthermore because the board an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our we believe that our have an adequate opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of the incentive compensation and each year because the already regularly whether our incentive compensation provide proper to our to achieve our strategic roi and because our already receive annual on those in the in our annual proxy we believe that the adoption of the policy by the proposal is unnecessary duplicative of already by the and our company and would result in an expenditure of and our and time that ultimately would not be in our best for the above the board that the
