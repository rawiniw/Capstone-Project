our commerce distribution as well as an estimate for but through our and in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to understand better underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the

company working capital through free cash flow table of ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net and for fiscal and respectively when to the previous fiscal year the

club the positive effect of these was partially offset by billion of negative impact from in currency exchange and in comparable store at and in number of our international the increase in net for fiscal was due to growth in retail square and positive comparable store and club additionally net from through their respective anniversary for billion of the increase in net the increase in net for fiscal was partially offset by billion of negative impact from in currency exchange calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal and were as with ended fiscal ended sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel in fiscal and in fiscal when to the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club for fiscal were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to the slow recovery in general economic the increase in the payroll tax rate and the reduction in government food and severe winter that during the fourth quarter these were partially offset by member traffic at sam club primarily coming from additionally commerce positively impacted comparable store and sam club comparable club by approximately the total comparable store and club for fiscal as result of average ticket and an increase in customer traffic as we continue to add and in the we do so with an understanding that additional and may take away from we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club as result of opening and was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by the of the impacted and which are based on their proximity to the and to those of nearby non impacted and in each case as measured after the and are table of ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe both the growth of our operating and our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective for fiscal year is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating at rate than net as operating as percentage of net basis overall lower than net higher investment in key such as global leverage and commerce and nearly billion of for various in the international segment discussion were the primary for the increase in operating as percentage of net additional related to the foreign corrupt act and as well as our global compliance program and related organizational also to the increase in operating as percentage of net the negative leverage impact of these was partially offset by lower incentive for fiscal for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating at rate than net as operating as percentage of net basis the fiscal decrease in operating as percentage of net was primarily due to productivity and expense management for the and as well as our global compliance program and related organizational were fiscal and respectively operating fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net as operating income while net when to the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the we for not operating partially offset by in membership and other income of for fiscal we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net as operating income while net when to the previous fiscal year the primary for operating income growing than net in fiscal were our in commerce related to the and as well as our global compliance program and related organizational and in price which reduced gross table of on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for fiscal and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to decline in operating income in property and equipment and the impact of roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was and for fiscal and respectively we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve or fiscal year divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of plus average depreciation and amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating roi from which is consolidated income from for the period divided by average total assets of for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets of for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as fiscal ended in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets of average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on from total assets of return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets of depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of as of and in the table exclude assets of that are reflected in the company consolidated balance of million million and million respectively table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of billion fiscal and respectively the decline in free cash flow for fiscal when to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the timing of income tax as well as lower income from and slightly higher capital the fiscal increase in free cash flow was primarily due to higher income from positively net cash from operating and lower capital free cash flow is considered non financial measure we consider net cash provided by operating to be the financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow management that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated income from as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the used by other to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating as well as information regarding net cash used in and net cash used in fiscal ended in millions net cash provided by operating for property and equipment free cash flow

commerce related to the and as well as our global compliance program and related organizational and in price which reduced gross table of effective income tax were and for fiscal and respectively the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax for fiscal and is in note in the to consolidated financial our effective income tax rate for fiscal was higher than in fiscal primarily due to the tax attributable to international earnings during fiscal our fiscal effective income tax rate was lower than in fiscal primarily because the fiscal rate from number of discrete tax the positive impact from fiscal legislative at the end of the fiscal year most notably the taxpayer relief act of our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as result of in

for fiscal the increase in net was due to increase in comparable store as result of higher average ticket and an increase in customer traffic combined with increase in retail square the fiscal gross profit rate declined slightly when to the previous fiscal year primarily due to our commitment to low price leadership especially during fiscal highly competitive holiday season partially offset by

not leverage for fiscal as operating as percentage of segment net basis when to the previous fiscal year the increase in operating as percentage of segment net was primarily due to million charge for

provided by operating in fiscal when to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to higher income for cash and working and cash were and respectively our working capital were and respectively the decrease in our working capital deficit was primarily attributable to decrease in long term debt due within one year and an increase in our inventory due to lower than across the company timing also to the decrease in our working capital deficit we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in and in providing to our in the form of share and of cash we employ global in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the

outside of the in our foreign when the income either from or through global and indefinitely outside of the is taxed at local country tax which are generally lower than the statutory rate we realize

consider various qualitative and quantitative we monitor the ratio of our debt to total capitalization as support for our long term at and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term long term debt due within one year under capital due within one year long term debt and long term under

also discuss various legal related to the investigation in item of the form under the caption item legal under the sub caption certain other summary of critical accounting to report our financial in clear and understandable manner although in some accounting and disclosure are complex and require us to use technical terminology in the company consolidated financial we follow accounting generally accepted in the united these require us to make certain and apply that affect our financial position and of as reflected in our financial these and are based on past and of future actual may differ from our management continually our accounting how they are applied and how they are and disclosed in our financial following is summary of our critical accounting and how they are applied in preparation of the financial value at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the segment merchandise the retail method of accounting in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent are currently taken as reduction of the retail value of inventory the sam club segment merchandise is valued based on the weighted average cost the lifo method for the international segment are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated the first in first out fifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is stated at cost which is determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent the retail method of accounting management to make certain and that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit made include recording used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management the ability to sell inventory for clearance activity and the related cost impact are considered in the determination of include current and demand customer and age of merchandise as table of as seasonal and fashion in weather and customer could cause material in the amount and timing of from year to year when necessary we record lifo provision for the annual effect of inflation and these are to actual determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory markup and internally retail price indices at and our valued at lifo those as if they were valued at fifo we provide for inventory or shrinkage between physical inventory on the basis of percentage of following annual inventory the provision is to reflect historical impairment of evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite for of impairment whenever or in indicate their carrying may not be recoverable management regarding the existence of impairment are based on market and operational performance such as operating income and cash the evaluation for long lived assets is at the level of identifiable cash which is generally at the individual store level or in certain at the market group level the variability of these on number of uncertainty about future and in thus our accounting may change from period to period these could cause management to conclude that of impairment exist and require impairment be which could result in management the value of long lived assets is resulting in write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not but are for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate that the value of certain asset may be generally this evaluation with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after an assessment based on the qualitative that the fair value of the unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that fair value of the unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be the quantitative test for impairment management to make to future cash growth and economic and market these are based on the fair value of unit or asset valuation method such as cash flow or relative market based approach historically our have sufficient to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the used in these if different occur in future future operating could be materially impacted income have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income in the and numerous foreign accordingly the

may fluctuate as result our tax are routinely and of raised in these sometimes affect our tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax will withstand challenge if any from taxing when and change we reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate we account for uncertain tax by the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is to meet before being in the financial this determination the use of significant judgment in our tax and the timing and of deductible and taxable deferred tax assets represent available to reduce income payable on taxable income in future such assets arise because of temporary between the financial and tax bases of assets and as well as from net operating loss and tax credit deferred tax assets are for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be many are considered when whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recent cumulative earnings of future taxable income and other relevant quantitative and qualitative the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is by the adequacy of
