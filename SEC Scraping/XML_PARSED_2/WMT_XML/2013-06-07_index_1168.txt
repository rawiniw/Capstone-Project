measuring the change in for such and for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion is by relocation or expansion that in change in retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other table of our operating the term currency exchange to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar we calculate the effect of in currency exchange as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate when we refer to constant currency operating we are to our operating without the impact of the currency exchange rate and without the impact of until the are included in both comparable the disclosure of constant currency or to understand better underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate or volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future we made certain to prior period or to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these did not impact the company operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense have been among to be comparable with the current period presentation company performance company performance metrics emphasize three for improving shareholder value growth leverage and the company priority of growth on through comparable store and club and unit square growth the priority of leverage the company objective to increase its operating income at faster rate than the growth in net by growing its operating selling general and administrative operating at rate than the growth of its net and the priority of on how efficiently the company its assets through return on investment and how effectively the company working capital through free cash flow ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net for the three when to the same period in the previous fiscal year the increase in net was due to year over year growth in retail square as well as million of net from made in fiscal the increase in net was partially offset by negative comparable across the company and billion of negative impact from in currency exchange the net for the three also included an extra day due to leap year which impacted the net comparison approximately calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and were as three ended with sam club total table of ended in millions operating international sam club corporate and support operating income we believe the growth of our operating to the growth of our net and the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net are meaningful as they indicate how effectively we manage and leverage operating our objective is to grow operating at rate than net and to grow operating income at faster rate than net on occasion we may make strategic growth that may at cause our operating to grow at faster rate than net and that may result in our operating income growing at rate than net operating the three operating when to the same period in the previous fiscal year while net when to the same period in the previous fiscal year operating primarily due to continued investment in our global as well as related to the foreign corrupt act of the three slightly the increase in operating was decline in associate incentive expense for the three operating the three operating income grew by when to the same period in the previous fiscal year while net by when to the same period in the previous fiscal year although in currency exchange negatively impacted operating income by million we met our objective of growing operating income at faster rate than net by increasing our gross profit as percentage of net gross profit rate for the three on investment management return on investment roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term roi was and for the trailing twelve month ended and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to the impact of and an increase in property and equipment we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the roi is considered non financial measure we consider return on assets to be the financial measure in accordance with generally accepted accounting that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the other use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their roi before our roi to that of such other table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating in period minus for property and equipment made in that period we free cash flow of the three to free cash flow of the three the decline in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of income tax resulting largely from in federal bonus depreciation and an increase in capital when to the same period in the previous fiscal year free cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash flow which our ability to generate additional cash from our business is an important financial measure for use in the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as substitute for consolidated net income as measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating as measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash available for discretionary as the measure does not deduct the for debt service and other contractual or made for business therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as measure that supplemental information to our consolidated of cash although other report their free cash flow numerous may exist for calculating company free cash flow as result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the other use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the used by other to calculate their free cash flow before our free cash flow to that of such other the following table forth reconciliation of free cash flow non financial measure to net cash provided by operating which we believe to be

depreciation cash and working and cash were and respectively our working capital were and respectively the increase in our working capital deficit is primarily attributable to the increase in our long term debt due within one year we generally operate with working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in and in providing to our in the form of stock and of we employ in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash outside of the and anticipate our domestic
