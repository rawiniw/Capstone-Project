management the of the company each segment operating income certain corporate overhead as well as other from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment operating income certain corporate overhead and other as determined by the information regularly by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period and are to conform to the current period presentation comparable store and club is metric that the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year definition of comparable store and club from and open for the previous and as well as commerce we measure the commerce impact by those through our and our mobile commerce and through our commerce distribution as well as an estimate for and on our mobile commerce but through our and of store that in format are from comparable store and club when the conversion of that store is by relocation or expansion that in change in the store retail square of more than five percent comparable store and club are also to as same store by within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club across the retail industry as result our calculation of comparable store and club is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled by other in our operating we use the term currency exchange to refer to the currency exchange we use to convert the operating for all where the functional currency is not the dollar into for financial we calculate the effect of in currency exchange from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity the current period currency exchange and current period activity the comparable prior year period currency exchange throughout our discussion we refer to the of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility in currency exchange may impact the net and operating income of the company and the international segment in the future the retail operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the we serve we face strong competition from other discount department drug dollar variety

save money and live better through everyday low by everyday low at we adjust our business to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the in which we operate for several our performance metrics three financial growth leverage and we are currently making strategic in our and in the integration of digital and physical retail these support long term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low which are by everyday low cost during this time of we have our financial to focus primarily on growth balanced by the long term health of the company although we will continue to grow through and our growth going forward will rely more on increasing comparable store and club as well as our to accelerate commerce growth while leverage remains important to everyday low cost during this time of operating may grow at rate that is greater than or equal to the rate of our net growth and operating income may grow at rate that is equal to or less than the rate of our net growth our objective of balancing growth with that we are on efficiently assets for return on investment and more effectively working capital to deliver strong free cash flow we will also continue to provide to our through share and table of measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period over period growth in our net and our comparable store and club we also review the progress of our digital retail by measuring the impact commerce have on our comparable store and club at we make strategic which are on the long term growth of the company these strategic may not benefit net and comparable store and club in the near term net ended nine ended in millions net international sam club net our consolidated net for both the three and nine respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year the in net were primarily due to overall positive comparable and year over year growth in consolidated retail square the positive effect of such on our consolidated net was substantially offset by in currency exchange and in fuel due to lower fuel at the sam club segment for the three and nine respectively calendar comparable store and club store and club is metric which the performance of our and by measuring the change in for such and commerce for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally comparable store and club the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings however when we discuss our comparable store and club below we are to our calendar comparable store and club calculated our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club provided in our quarterly earnings calendar comparable store and club as well as the impact of fuel for the three and nine and were as three ended nine ended with sam club total comparable store and club in the fuel and for and nine respectively when to the same in the previous fiscal year the total comparable store and club were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement at the segment and higher commerce at both the and sam club the positive effect of such on our comparable store and club were partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel due to lower fuel at the sam club segment commerce positively impacted comparable approximately and for the three and approximately and for the nine for and sam club respectively table of we are primarily on growth we also place priority on generating to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced we generate by efficiently assets and effectively working capital we monitor these through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics which we discuss below in addition we are on providing to our in the form of share and which are in the liquidity and capital section we include return on assets which is based on financial statement line from our financial in accordance with generally accepted accounting in the and return on investment roi as metrics to assess on assets return on assets and return on investment management roi is meaningful metric to share with because it assess how effectively is its assets in roi can fluctuate over time as management long term potential strategic with possible short term we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively roi was and for the trailing twelve ended and respectively the in and roi were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these we define roi as operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing divided by average capital during that period we consider average capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average depreciation and average amortization less average payable and average for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing by factor of eight when we have we exclude the impact of the our calculation of roi is considered non financial measure because we calculate roi financial that exclude and include that are included and in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and in accordance with for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of eight for rent expense that the hypothetical capitalization of our operating as above we consider to be the financial measure in accordance with that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi from which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi operating income to exclude certain expense and interest income total assets for the impact of depreciation and amortization payable and and factor of rent to arrive at total capital because of the above we believe roi more accurately how we are our key assets and is more meaningful to than although roi is standard financial metric numerous exist for calculating company roi as result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the used by other to calculate their roi table of calculation of roi along with reconciliation to the calculation of the most comparable financial measure is as for the trailing twelve ending in millions calculation of return on income interest income depreciation and amortization rent operating income total assets average depreciation and amortization average payable average rent average capital return on investment roi calculation of return on net income total assets return on assets as of certain balance sheet assets depreciation and amortization payable the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of cash cash flow is considered non financial measure management however that free cash
