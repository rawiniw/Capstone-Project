consolidated into the financial critical accounting our analysis of and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting preparation of these consolidated financial us to make and affecting the of assets and at the date of the consolidated financial of and during the period and related of contingent assets and in the to consolidated financial we describe the significant accounting used in the consolidated financial our are on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other that we believe to be reasonable under the actual could differ under other or however we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future or our senior management the development and selection of our critical accounting with the audit committee of our board of the following in our consolidated financial require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of under this method inventory is stated at cost the last in first out lifo method as determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value the cost of our inventory the amount we pay to our to acquire inventory freight in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution and and import reduced by vendor income and cash the majority of our distribution operating compensation and are in the period since inventory value is regularly to reflect market our inventory methodology the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for related to shrink and our shrink estimate is based on historical by ongoing physical inventory historically our actual physical inventory count have shown our to be reliable for clearance activity are when the salability of the merchandise inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic change consumer demand guest consumer credit or increasing competition we believe these are largely because our inventory typically turns in less than three inventory was million and million at and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial table of contents vendor income receivable cost of and are partially offset by various of consideration received from our this vendor income is for variety of vendor such as volume markdown and advertising as well as for our compliance we establish receivable for the vendor income that is but not yet received based on the in place this receivable is by when we have our performance and when the amount is the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the used in our estimate will change significantly historically to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was million and million at and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial credit card receivables accounting historically our credit card receivables were at par value less an allowance for doubtful when receivables were we an allowance for doubtful in an amount equal to future write the allowance included for uncollectible finance and other credit related we future write based on historical experience of risk aging and industry risk were automatically written off when they days past due management the allowance for doubtful was appropriate to cover in our credit card receivable however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the above or in general economic could have materially these as of our consumer credit card receivables are at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as for sale as result of the credit card receivables transaction lower of cost par or fair value is determined on segmented basis the delinquency and credit quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful many are at cost par because fair value cost delinquent are generally at fair value which our expectation of on these receivables refer to note of the to consolidated financial for more information on our credit card receivables long lived assets long lived assets are for impairment whenever or in indicate that the carrying may not be recoverable the evaluation is at the level of identifiable cash independent of other assets an impairment loss would be when undiscounted future cash from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured cash or independent of value as appropriate percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not material upon sale of long lived assets insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain associated with these include of both and but not yet we use actuarial which consider number of to estimate our ultimate cost of general liability and compensation are at our estimate of their net present value other to above are not our compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at and respectively we believe that the are appropriate however our could be significantly affected if future or loss differ from our for example percent increase or decrease in average claim would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically to our have not been material refer to item for further disclosure of the market associated with these table of contents income we pay income based on the tax and case law of the various in which we operate significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible and taxable and in the ultimate resolution of tax in dispute with tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after it is likely the uncertain tax would withstand challenge by taxing we periodically reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate for uncertain tax interest and were million and million at and respectively we believe the resolution of these will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial income are further in note of the to consolidated financial pension and health care accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded and health care plan for certain current and retired team the for these are determined based on actuarial the in the following eligibility and the level of depending on team full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these are determined based on actuarial about the long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth the used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with made for any significant plan or participant our long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market our compound annual rate of return on qualified assets was percent percent percent and percent for the year year year and year respectively one percentage point decrease in our long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit is annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate for that are in line with the duration of our pension our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with in interest percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team than it does for older longer service pension eligible team pension and health care are further in note of the to consolidated financial legal we are exposed to and litigation in the ordinary course of business and use various to resolve these in manner that we believe the best interest of our and other historically to our have not been material we believe the in our consolidated financial are adequate in light of the probable and estimable we do not believe that any of the currently or litigation will have material adverse impact on our of cash or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent and unfavorable could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be material adverse impact on the of cash or financial condition for the period in which the ruling or future accounting we do not expect that any recently accounting will have material effect on our financial table of contents forward looking this report forward looking which are based on our current and these are typically by the expect may could believe would might or of similar import the principal forward looking in this report include for our credit card segment aggregate portfolio for our segment the timing and amount of future capital in canada and our subsequent financial performance on consolidated basis regarding the adequacy of and associated with our of liquidity the fair value of our consumer credit card receivables the pending sale of these receivables and related gain beneficial interest the application of proceeds from the sale and the impact on our future of earnings and the continued execution of our share repurchase program our capital the effective income tax rate the compliance with debt the impact of accounting our regarding future and related to our pension and health care the on pension plan assets the impact of future in foreign currency exchange the in gross and the effects of the adequacy of our for general liability compensation and property loss the outcome of and litigation the ability to recognize deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss and the resolution of tax all such forward looking are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking in the private litigation reform act of as although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking our actual could be materially different the most important which could cause our actual to differ from our forward looking are set forth on our description of risk in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking in this report forward looking speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative about market risk at our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate on our debt some of which are at plus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance at prime based floating rate historically to manage our net interest we generally of floating rate debt to generate similar in net interest expense as finance charge the degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate at the amount of floating rate credit card assets the amount of net floating rate debt by approximately billion see further description of our debt and derivative in and of the to consolidated financial as result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio risk was transferred to group following the sale our interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt differ from our floating rate short term in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term over time but that may vary in different interest rate we record our general liability and compensation at net present value therefore these fluctuate with in interest periodically in certain interest rate we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate by entering into interest rate forward that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in interest would be to decrease earnings before income by million in addition we are exposed to market return on our qualified defined benefit pension percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million the value of our pension is inversely related to in interest to protect against table of contents in interest we hold high quality long duration and interest rate in our pension plan trust at year end we had percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully in note and note of the to consolidated financial we are exposed to market on team member in our unfunded deferred compensation we control the risk of offering the by making in life insurance and forward on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the on these the effect of one percentage point change in market on our defined contribution inclusive of the effect of the investment used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant we are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate we will be further exposed to this risk as we commence during during and gains and due to in exchange were not significant as all were in the united and
