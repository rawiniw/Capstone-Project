balance sheet do not have any or with that are not consolidated into the financial or financial that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital critical accounting our analysis of and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting preparation of these consolidated financial us to make and affecting the of assets and at the date of the consolidated financial of and during the period and related of contingent assets and in the to consolidated financial we describe the significant accounting used in the consolidated financial our are on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other that we believe to be reasonable under the actual could differ under other or however we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future or our senior management the development and selection of our critical accounting with the audit committee of our board of the following in our consolidated financial require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of under this method inventory is stated at cost the last in first out lifo method as determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value cost the purchase price as for vendor income since inventory value is regularly to reflect market our inventory methodology the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for related to shrink and our shrink estimate is based on historical by ongoing physical inventory historically our actual physical inventory count have shown our to be reliable for clearance activity are when the salability of the merchandise inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic change relevant economic include consumer demand customer consumer credit or increasing competition we believe these are largely because our inventory typically turns in less than three inventory was million and million at and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial vendor income of and are partially offset by various of consideration received from our this vendor income is for variety of vendor such as volume markdown and advertising as well as for our compliance we establish receivable for the vendor income that is but not yet received based on the in place this receivable is by when we have our performance and when the amount is the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the used in our estimate will change significantly historically to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was million and million at and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial allowance for doubtful receivables are we recognize an allowance for doubtful in an amount equal to future write this allowance for uncollectible finance and other credit related we estimate future write based on historical experience of risk aging and industry risk substantially all continue to accrue finance until they are written off are automatically written off when they become days past due management the allowance for doubtful is adequate to cover in our credit card receivable under current however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the table of contents above or in general economic could materially change these during we continued risk management and underwriting that reduced available credit for higher risk in addition we experienced an increase in payment and decrease in charge activity from in card usage by our as result of these our allowance for doubtful related to our credit card receivables million from million or percent of gross credit card receivables at to million or percent of gross credit card receivables at credit card receivables and our allowance for doubtful are in note of the to consolidated financial long lived lived assets are for impairment whenever or in indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss would be when undiscounted future cash from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group asset have identifiable cash independent of other asset measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured cash or independent of value as appropriate percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell as of would result in additional impairment of approximately million in historically we have not material upon sale of long lived assets goodwill and intangible evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever or in indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable cash flow are used in fair value of goodwill and intangible assets growth for and are determined from our long range process we also make of discount perpetuity growth and other as of and we had million and million of goodwill and intangible assets respectively while we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets its carrying value materially different regarding future performance of our or other could result in impairment insurance self retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain associated with these include of both and but not yet we use actuarial which consider number of to estimate our ultimate cost of general liability and compensation are at our estimate of their net present value other to above are not our compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at and respectively we believe that the are adequate however our could be significantly affected if future or loss differ from our for example percent increase or decrease in average claim would impact our self insurance expense by approximately million in historically to our have not been material refer to item for further disclosure of the market associated with these income pay income based on the tax and case law of the various in which we operate significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible and taxable and in the ultimate resolution of tax in dispute with tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after whether it is likely the uncertain tax would withstand challenge by taxing we periodically reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate for tax considered uncertain interest and were million and million at and respectively we believe the resolution of these will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial income are further in note of the to consolidated financial table of contents pension and health care fund and maintain qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller and health care plan for certain current and retired team the for these are determined based on actuarial the in the following eligibility for and the level of these depending on team full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service our long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market expense during the year is partially dependent upon the long term rate of return used one percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return used to determine net pension and health care expense would increase annual expense by approximately million the discount rate used to determine benefit is annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate as of the measurement date for that are in line with the duration of our pension therefore these fluctuate with in interest historically this same discount rate also been used to determine net pension and health care expense for the following plan year expense during the year is partially dependent upon the discount used and percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and health care expense would increase annual expense by approximately million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team than it does for older longer service pension eligible team pension and health care are further in note of the to consolidated financial legal are exposed to and litigation in the ordinary course of business and use various to resolve these in manner that we believe the best interest of our and other historically to our have not been material we believe the in our consolidated financial are adequate in light of the probable and estimable we do not believe that any of the currently or litigation will have material adverse impact on our of cash or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent and unfavorable could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be material adverse impact on the of cash or financial condition for the period in which the ruling or future accounting recent in june the no accounting for of financial assets an amendment of statement no in the and accounting which amends the guidance in former statement no and the exemption from consolidation for special purpose we adopted this guidance at the beginning of and adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings cash or financial position in june the no to interpretation no in the consolidation accounting which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest the significantly affected the overall consolidation analysis under former interpretation no we adopted this guidance at the beginning of and the adoption had no impact on our consolidated net earnings cash or financial position table of contents outlook our outlook is based on the application of business judgment in light of current business our regarding the environment and of the impact of current the most significant of which are our store remodel program the percent program and our expansion in the retail segment we expect that comparable store will increase in the to percent range in we expect that our store remodel program will contribute incremental comparable store and net of the adverse impact of remodel disruption this impact will grow to run rate of about percentage as we progress through the year separately we expect that the contribution of our program will grow more rapidly in its importance up to percentage to our same store growth later in these are based on of the current performance of these in we expect to produce full year rate consistent with due to favorable leverage of and depreciation and amortization the gross rate associated with our store remodel and this impact is unlikely to occur in the spring particularly in the first quarter resulting in modest pressure on rate in the spring and modest on this measure in the fall in our credit card segment we expect receivables will continue to decline in with the pace of the decline as the year we expect that the allowance for doubtful will continue to decline in as well due to this decline in receivables and continued improvement in portfolio we also expect of our rate of portfolio profitability to remain strong in additionally in we our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio as of the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was million of which million was funded by third and million was funded by target in we into an agreement to purchase the leasehold in up to in canada currently by in exchange for million due in two one in may and one in we believe this transaction will allow us to open to target in canada primarily during we expect that renovation of these will require an investment of over billion portion of which may be funded by our direct associated with entry into canada may add to an earnings per share equivalent in the range of for an estimate that will continue to evolve over time we currently believe the aggregate effect of our expansion could result in to unfavorable impact on reflecting direct incremental and the indirect impact of the investment on the pace of share repurchase we expect that the dilutive impact of the expansion will exceed the dilutive impact due primarily to full year of lease related we expect capital related to our retail to be approximately billion driven primarily by remodel program we expect to open in the in approximately net of and we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan although at pace due to our expansion in the range of billion to billion during the timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market and the amount of future net earnings and cash we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to percent forward looking this report forward looking which are based on our current and these are typically by the expect may could believe would might or of similar import the principal forward looking in this report include for our retail segment our outlook for comparable store the impact of our store remodel and and for our credit card segment our outlook for year end gross credit card receivables future write of current receivables rate of portfolio table of contents profitability the allowance for doubtful improvement in portfolio and the pursuit of portfolio sale on consolidated basis on the investment in canada and its impact on our regarding the adequacy of our of liquidity the continued execution of our share repurchase program our capital and the number of to be in the effective income tax rate the compliance with debt our regarding future our future share based compensation expense our return on plan assets our expense and benefit related to our pension and health care the adequacy of our for general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental the potential impact of in our critical accounting the outcome of and litigation and the resolution of tax all such forward looking are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking in the private litigation reform act of as although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking our actual could be materially different the most important which could cause our actual to differ from our forward looking are set forth on our description of risk in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking in this report forward looking speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily from interest rate on our debt some of which are at plus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance at prime based floating rate to manage our net interest we generally maintain of floating rate debt to generate similar in net interest expense as finance charge fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate at the amount of floating rate credit card assets the amount of net floating rate debt by approximately billion as result based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in floating interest on our floating rate debt net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable would be to decrease earnings before income by approximately million see further description in note of the to consolidated financial we record our general liability and compensation at net present value therefore these fluctuate with in interest periodically in certain interest rate we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate by entering into interest rate forward that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in interest would be to decrease earnings before income by approximately million in addition we are exposed to market return on our qualified defined benefit pension the effect of one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by million at the value of our pension is inversely related to in interest to protect against in interest we hold high quality long duration and interest rate in our pension plan trust at year end we had approximately percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully in note and note of the to consolidated financial we are exposed to market on team member in our unfunded deferred compensation we control the risk of offering the by making in life insurance and forward on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the on these the effect of one percentage point change in market on our defined contribution inclusive of the effect of the investment used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant table of contents we do not currently have significant direct exposure to foreign currency as all of our are in the united and the vast majority of merchandise is in our previously agreement to purchase leasehold in canada will expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate between the dollar and the dollar beginning in overall there have been no material in our primary risk or management of market
