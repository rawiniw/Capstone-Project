and its competitive advantage in the and to provide framework that outstanding financial and shareholder over the long term our executive compensation reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we incorporate mix of cash and equity compensation with time and financial to reward sustained outstanding performance put an emphasis on variable compensation with financial performance that correlate with the creation of shareholder value and directly the of our executive with those of our by linking long term compensation to stock price performance are to read the which in depth how our executive compensation are with our performance and the creation of shareholder value the compensation committee and the board of believe that the and in the effectively implement our pay for performance compensation philosophy table of contents the board of upon recommendation of the compensation committee that vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the approve the compensation to the executive as in the tabular and other narrative executive compensation in this proxy statement effect of item the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this item by will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding target executive compensation the final decision on the compensation and of our executive and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation and that are in the best of target and its the board the of target as expressed through their and other although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder received from other when making future compensation item proposal to adopt policy for the federation of state county and municipal which more than of of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved the of target corporation target request the board of to adopt policy and amend the as necessary to reflect that policy to require the chair of the board of to be an independent member of the board this independence requirement shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation at the time this resolution is adopted compliance with this policy is if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair shareholder supporting statement also as chair of target board of we believe the combination of these two in single person corporation governance structure which can harm shareholder value as former chair grove stated the separation of the two goes to the heart of the conception of corporation is company sandbox for the or is the an employee if he an employee he needs boss and that boss is the board the chairman the board how can the be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide balance of power between the and the board and can support strong board leadership the primary duty of board of is to oversee the management of company on behalf of its we believe table of contents that serve as chair conflict of interest that can result in excessive management influence on the board and weaken the board oversight of management an independent board chair been found in to improve the financial performance of public study found that in all of the north with long an independent board chair the era of the inclusive leader summer more recent study found that are now routinely separating the of chair and in less than percent of incoming were also made chair with percent in succession decade of convergence and compression summer we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly constructive at target where in all other compensation of more than million topped the for overall last year among fortune outrageously lavish money and received more than three the average compensation of the next highest executive officer at the company show large executive pay inequity is associated with lower firm value greater entrenchment and higher cost of capital pay distribution in the executive team executive pay disparity and the cost of equity capital may we urge to vote for this proposal position of the board of the board of considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our the board that any decision to maintain combined chairman role or to separate these should be based on the specific of corporation the independence and of its and the leadership provided by its the board does not believe that separating the of chairman and should be or that such separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for the board that its current leadership structure and governance allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically we have lead independent director with significant that are in detail on page of this proxy statement independent meet frequently in executive sessions that are over by our lead director with no of management or chairman of the board present independent use these executive sessions to discuss of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate evaluation of the and senior management management succession to be included on board board informational needs and board effectiveness the all the audit governance and compensation are independent these board committee determine to be and to be in the covered by their respective committee our board that knowledge of the day to day of target perspective on the competitive environment understanding of shareholder and with our business team and the in which we do business allow him to table of contents provide effective leadership in his role as chairman and furthermore our clearly defined lead independent director role and independent key committee provide framework for effective direction and oversight by the board our board that its current governance structure clear accountability target to present its strategy with unified voice and the best of at this time the board of that vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt policy for an independent chairman item proposal on electronics as you sow telegraph ave suite ca on behalf of shareholder global fund which more than of of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that target corp board of prepare report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental of its electronics by providing for take back of all electronics sold reuse of working equipment and export to non of hazardous waste and untested or non working equipment or shareholder supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth retailer of consumer electronics and such contain toxic such as lead cadmium flame polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle less than of electronics are collected for according to the environmental protection agency waste is the growing and most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream more than the collection rate for waste the recovery rate for municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental and with cathode ray contain large of lead flat screen contain and computer contain cadmium which can be harmful to human health if to the environment electronic goods collected for in the are often shipped by to where they endanger health and the environment by action network have revealed appalling in china and of where break apart and process old electronic equipment under primitive openly burn toxic plastics and and melt circuit to extract gold silver and copper these threaten worker health and pollute land and water target corporate responsibility report being responsible steward of the environment is one of the most important that target corporate reputation yet the company does not offer take back for the full range of electronics it and its lack adequate certification to ensure safe disposal of collected the company back small such as music and mobile but does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of table of contents electronics it or information about whether waste are with the it set recent of fraudulent demonstrate the need for evidence the company is how collected goods are believe our company should develop nationwide return program for all electronic it or nearby convenient for all electronics collected should be or by responsible electronics who are independently to meet superior standard such as the standard best buy back wide range of electronics for free and downstream service from non working equipment or to and third party provider and office depot also offer take back for large electronics position of the board of the board of considered this proposal and as it did with respect to similar proposal last year that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our we address in detail our responsible for waste our in store program where our go and other to divert waste from in our corporate responsibility report available at corporate target corporate responsibility our responsible for waste which we contractually obligate our vendor to follow address several of the by the proponent those include that all are broken down and or for re use all waste domestically and waste from being sent to anywhere in the world monthly by on all and activity which along with site transparency and visibility into vendor our program consideration of whether have met various certification such as the standard in the proposal and the responsible standard the internal and reputation and periodic process and by appropriate target team or third party the vendor responsible for the majority of target waste is independently certified to meet the standard the proposal received this year is nearly identical to last year proposal and us to consider expanding the scope of our guest facing program to include all electronics sold our guest facing program already to easily recycle small electronics such as ink and cell as well as glass and plastic and plastic in their local target store in the fall of we expect to expand the guest facing program to pilot additional portable electronic such as portable and this pilot would not include electronics such as or we continue to believe that these of through our would be disruptive to our store and less efficient relative to other available to for disposal of such the availability of local government run target is to we continue to offer to our where it sense for our business to continue to drive across the country target is now included on earth as searchable destination for the above target is also working with third party to include vendor search function on target that will provide for to recycle that are not currently in the scope of our program such as large we expect to select the vendor by the end of the third quarter of fiscal and the vendor search functionality to be available on target in early table of contents we do not believe separate report is because we already actively monitor our and disposal for waste above and beyond legal compliance and our program our electronics take back is consistent with if not ahead of among general merchandise based on the above the board that our current approach to waste is appropriate and is in the best of target and our the board of that vote against the shareholder proposal on
