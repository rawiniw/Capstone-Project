the historical lease classification in addition we plan to elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term while lease classification will remain unchanged hindsight may result in different accounting lease for certain and affect the timing of depreciation interest and rent expense and the amount of lease assets and we expect to make an accounting policy
