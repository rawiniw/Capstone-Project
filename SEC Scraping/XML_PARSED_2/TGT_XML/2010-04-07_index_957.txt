is important to you the complete of and reflecting the in and is set forth in this summary is qualified in its entirety to the of the and in which you are to read in its entirety item of amendment to our to our board of to provide for annual of all the board is currently classified which it is divided into three classes and of each class are to serve for three year of classified believe that they provide continuity and stability to the board facilitate long term outlook by the board and improve the board position when with an unsolicited suitor on the other hand an increasing number of have come to believe that classified reduce accountability of because they limit the ability of to evaluate and elect all annually the board is to good corporate governance in making its recommendation the board considered carefully from our regarding the of both classified and board the board determined that the of classified board were by the of the ability to evaluate all annually and the adoption of structure that is currently considered by many to be best practice in corporate governance consequently the board that an amendment to our of incorporation to provide for the annual election of all is in the best of target and its if the amendment to declassify the board is by the at this annual meeting the board structure would be in as the at this annual meeting will be for one year term the will continue to serve the remainder of their which expire at the annual meeting the whose are to expire at the annual meeting have all resignation conditioned on the approval of this item such that they will serve only one year of their term but would be eligible to stand for election at the annual meeting and starting with the annual meeting all will be annually also requirement that shareholder must provide the board with at least days notice prior to the date of the annual meeting of any the shareholder to nominate for election as director at the annual meeting of item would eliminate this provision from our of incorporation the board already an amendment to our to add an advance notice provision for director this bylaw provision will take effect if this amendment to the is and it that advance notice of director must be given at least days prior to the first anniversary date of the prior year annual meeting of however if the date of the annual meeting is more than days before or days after the first anniversary date of the prior year annual meeting of advance notice of director must be given by the later of at least days prior to the date of the annual meeting or within days following the first public announcement of the annual meeting date the bylaw provision also additional regarding the shareholder and the shareholder the board the of other large with respect to advance notice and that the day notice and additional disclosure are consistent with the of many of those and also reasonable to impose on currently also forth complicated method for the of the board under of our current of incorporation he number of may be by the or board of or by the from the number of on the board of immediately prior to the effective date of this provided however that any change in the number of on the board of without limitation at annual of shall be by the affirmative vote of not less than seventy five percent of the to be cast by the of all then outstanding of voting stock as defined in voting together as single class unless such change shall have been by majority of the entire board of if such change shall not have been so the number of shall remain the same this provision in the past ambiguity regarding the of the board particularly in the event of mid term director the amendment to that both the and the have the power to set the of the board regardless of whether the set is an increase or decrease from the number of then serving on the board the number of serving immediately prior to the effective date of the number at the previous year meeting or the number serving prior to or after death or resignation the effect of the amendment would be that our would know at the time when our annual proxy statement is each year the exact number of to be at the annual meeting unless there is shareholder proposal to change the number of without amendment the current might be to require the board to solicit shareholder approval each time it to maintain the of the board following director resignation or death we believe that the need for clarification is when all our are each year our current of incorporation require the approval of at least of the outstanding stock to vote in order to remove any member of the board or to amend or repeal any provision of the vote requirement was designed to protect against circumvention of the three year under the classified board structure and to promote the to target and its provided by that structure once the board is there is no longer strong reason for this protection similar rationale the deletion of the requirement to amend itself the amendment to would not alter the current requirement that shareholder in the of the board must be by of of the voting unless by the board any future amendment to that requirement would require the vote of of the voting power of the outstanding stock under the statutory of the business corporation act approval of this amendment will amend as shown on and will require the affirmative vote of the of not less than of the outstanding of our common stock if the amendment is not the board of will remain classified and the other to will not be adopted the board that vote for item item of amendment to our of incorporation to eliminate voting requirement for certain business of our that certain business as defined in the current of incorporation or by shareholder at least of our outstanding voting receive the approval of at least of the outstanding stock to vote on the transaction unless certain are met approval by majority of those who are as defined in the current of incorporation or satisfaction of certain price and procedure set forth in item is proposal to delete in its entirety under the current of the an interested shareholder defined generally as shareholder at least of the outstanding voting can not enter into business combination defined generally to include the same or similar as those in the definition of business combination in our current of incorporation with target for after becoming an interested shareholder unless prior to the transaction by which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder committee composed solely of one or more disinterested defined generally as director who not been an officer or employee of target or related organization during the preceding or if there are no such disinterested by committee of or more disinterested who are not either the business combination or the transaction by which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder of our current of incorporation was adopted before the enactment of the current regarding business with interested the board that the shareholder approval in of our current of incorporation is similar in purpose to the approval set forth in the as above and that the requirement is therefore no longer necessary or desirable the board thus that it is in the best of target and its to eliminate current of our of incorporation in its entirety in the event we are involved in transaction that business combination under the the of the statute would govern approval of this amendment will cause of our current of incorporation to be in its entirety as set forth on and it will require the affirmative vote of the of not less than of the outstanding of our common stock the board that vote for item item of the amendment and restatement of our of incorporation in addition to the to our of incorporation in and the board shareholder approval of proposal to amend and restate our of incorporation to integrate all by at the annual meeting into one document to conform cross in current and and to update statutory reference in current for change in the none of the in this item would change our authorized capital stock indemnification of and or limitation of liability and none of the would adversely affect the or of our this amendment and restatement will require the affirmative vote of majority of the of our common stock present in person or by proxy and to vote on this item at the annual meeting if any of and is not then the reflected by that item will not be made and our of incorporation will retain the current governing the subject matter of that item the board that vote for item item proposal regarding annual advisory vote on executive compensation trustee of revocable living trust alder street who of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that the of target corporation request the board of to adopt policy that the opportunity at each annual shareholder meeting to vote on an advisory resolution by management to ratify the compensation of the executive set forth in the proxy statement summary compensation table the and the narrative disclosure of material provided to understand the but not the compensation discussion and analysis the proposal to should make clear that the vote is non binding and would not affect any compensation or to any neo supporting statement in our view senior executive compensation at target not always been structured in ways that best serve while were negative total shareholder return for received over million in total compensation which is roughly the average pay of production in the general merchandise industry in close to say on pay on these more than in favor and more than had over strong shareholder support for this reform investor public and legislative about executive compensation have of intensity report by the conference board task force on executive compensation that pay become taking immediate and credible action in order to restore trust in the ability of to oversee executive compensation and for compensation which are transparent understandable and effectively to an advisory vote an annual referendum process for about senior executive compensation we believe this vote would provide our board and management useful information about shareholder on the company senior executive compensation especially when tied to an innovative investor communication program over have agreed to an advisory vote apple rand occidental petroleum and and nearly tarp the advisory vote in providing an opportunity to see it in action group in favor to allow to express their of executive compensation by an annual referendum process an advisory vote on executive compensation is another step forward in board accountability we believe sec and stock exchange listing do not provide with sufficient for providing input to on senior executive compensation we believe voting against the election of board to send message about executive compensation is blunt approach whereas an advisory vote more effective instrument we believe that company that clearly compensation philosophy and metrics reasonably links pay to performance and effectively to would find management advisory vote helpful tool we urge to vote for this resolution position of the board of the board considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our for the following the say on pay issue is currently being considered by congress and been as priority that may be in in addition current practice and by around the of say on pay are not uniform as result the precise form and frequency of shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation that is likely to be by law is subject to some uncertainty in light of the for federal legislation on this topic the board the best course of action is to wait for congress to clarify this issue rather than form of advisory vote policy that may be inconsistent with standard that may be in the near future the board to be open to input from regarding their specific and on target executive compensation as under with on page of this proxy statement can write any member of the board and express their we received this same proposal at our annual meeting of and of majority of the
