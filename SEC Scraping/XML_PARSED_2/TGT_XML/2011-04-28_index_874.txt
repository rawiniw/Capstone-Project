the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act that we seek non binding advisory vote from to approve the compensation as disclosed in the compensation discussion analysis tabular and related narrative of this proxy statement target compensation are structured to the of our with the of our they are designed to attract retain and motivate premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and competitive advantage in the and to provide framework that outstanding financial over the long term our compensation for executive reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we incorporate mix of cash and equity compensation with time and financial to reward sustained outstanding performance put an emphasis on variable compensation with financial performance that correlate with the creation of shareholder value and directly the of our executive with those of our by linking long term compensation to stock price performance are to read the which in depth how our compensation are with our performance and the creation of shareholder value the compensation committee and the board of believe that the and in the effectively implement our pay for performance compensation philosophy the board of upon recommendation of the compensation committee that vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the approve the compensation to the executive as in the tabular and other narrative executive compensation in this proxy statement effect of proposal the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this proposal by will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding target executive compensation the final decision on the compensation and of our executive and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation and that are in the best interest of target and its the board the of target as expressed through their and other although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder received from other when making future compensation item vote on the frequency of say on pay pursuant to section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act at least once every six we are to submit for shareholder vote non binding resolution to determine whether the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation shall occur every one two or three after careful consideration of the various supporting each frequency level the board that the advisory vote on executive compensation to on an annual basis is appropriate for target and its at this time the board of vote for frequency of year the proxy card with four every year or abstain are not voting to approve or disapprove the board recommendation effect of proposal the say on pay frequency vote is non binding the outcome of this vote will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding the frequency of future say on pay however the board and the compensation committee will consider the outcome of this vote in its decision on how often to present the say on pay vote to item proposal on compensation the pension plan street which of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that the board of of target corporation target adopt policy that used to establish base salary and total direct compensation for the executive be less than or equal to the of supporting statement as have to understand the sharp increase in the pay of us one feature that come under scrutiny is the use of peer and former the main reason compensation every year is that most want their to be in the half of the peer group because they think it the company look strong so when dick and harry receive compensation get one too even if had bad year this to an upward spiral what wrong with executive compensation business review we believe that this is the case even if compensation is set just slightly above the median but target goes beyond that according to target proxy statement the company typically base salary and total direct compensation for all executive near the of the retail peer group and of the general industry peer group for total direct compensation are at the of the retail peer group and at the of the general industry peer group the difference between the median and is substantial for fiscal the difference for the base salary between the median and the was at those is neither appropriate nor necessary and it to an upward spiral of compensation that is not in the best interest of target by setting the salary above the median the company virtually that salary will go up significantly every year and in fact that this every year since by setting total direct compensation at the target in effect up of pay at our company while also to effect at other that use target for peer comparison in pay designed to exceed the median will increase the median even if only small number of set such high the median will increase every year increase in compensation for the methodology that salary will increase routinely without regard to individual or company performance call on the board to adopt more appropriate for compensation we urge to vote for this proposal position of the board of the board of considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our as in more detail in the of this proxy statement the board that the used in total direct compensation to compensate at above the median of its peer is appropriate for the following the of target corporation in relation to the of its peer the board belief that the executive officer level within target are more expansive in scope than similar at peer specifically within the retail peer group the board belief that the executive officer are more complex given the diversified nature of our business the higher percentage of total direct compensation that is at risk for target executive to our retail and general industry peer the board general philosophy to ensure that target is able to attract and retain the highest level of talent available in the target record of better than the median of its retail peer group over various time the board of that vote against the shareholder proposal on compensation item proposal on electronics as you sow on behalf of shareholder who more than of of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that target corp board of prepare report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental of its electronics by reuse of working equipment and export to non of hazardous waste and untested or non working equipment or supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth retailer of consumer electronics which contain many toxic such as lead cadmium flame polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle the environmental protection agency that only percent of electronic waste disposed of in the was removed for in waste is the growing part of the municipal waste stream more than although the most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream the recovery rate for waste is far below the overall recovery rate for municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental old and with cathode ray contain large of lead flat screen contain and computer contain cadmium all of which can be harmful to human health if to the environment electronic goods collected for in the us are often shipped by to where they endanger health and the environment for instance harm the high tech of report by action network ban revealed appalling in the city of china where approximately migrant break apart and process old electronic equipment cell and under primitive openly burn plastics and and melt toxic circuit to extract gold silver and copper these threaten worker health and pollute land and water of lie strewn about the countryside ban exposed similarly disturbing in target corporate responsibility report we take responsibility for our social environmental and economic impact yet the company policy to ensure safe disposal of the electronics it our company take back for small such as music and mobile the company does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of electronics it whether it reuse of working equipment and whether it export of collected electronics to the harmful by ban in our view need that take back are how collected goods are or the believe all electronics collected by our company should be and or by globally responsible electronics who are independently to meet minimum standard such as the standard best buy for example downstream service from non working equipment or to and third party of position of board of the board of considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our target an active program to monitor its and disposal for electronic waste these include that all are for re use or broken down and all waste are domestically and no waste are sent to anywhere in the world monthly by on all and activity which along with site for transparency and visibility into vendor target program consideration of whether have met various certification such as the standard in the proposal the internal and reputation and periodic process and by appropriate target team or third party the vendor responsible for the majority of target waste is in the final of steward certification and completion in target does not believe special report to on this topic is necessary but will consider this topic in more detail in our corporate
