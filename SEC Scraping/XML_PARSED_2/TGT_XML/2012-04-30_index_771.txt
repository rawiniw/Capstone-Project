outstanding performance this approach with shareholder by on shareholder value performance such as market share earnings per share earnings before interest and and economic value added provide competitive package of long term pay at risk and time equity compensation and retirement to facilitate retention and provide to realize future value with in addition we continued our focus on sound corporate governance in our pay by an annual compensation risk assessment by the board independent compensation consultant consulting group stock ownership policy and an anti hedging policy for executive and not providing tax gross to our executive our performance framework for executive compensation pay mix allocation our compensation embrace strong pay for performance approach in which variable compensation also to as pay at risk majority of potential total compensation in order to motivate and reward sustained outstanding performance that is with shareholder total direct compensation for our executive is determined by the sum of three compensation base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation we allocate among the compensation by considering market data from our peer group this is done both by direct comparison of the amount of each element with peer group company data and also data on the relative of different by our peer this market data is used to establish range for each element that becomes reference point to determine final compensation allocation that is in line with market yet strong bias in favor of long term and performance linked compensation the chart below how base salary short term and long term comprised of stock performance share and restricted stock were to create the fiscal pay mix at goal for our

group market is another important factor considered in each executive officer as on due to imprecise comparability of executive officer between peer group market position is used as reference point in the determination process rather than formula driven outcome the following are when executive officer that have been established at above the median of our peer and for more experienced executive all

and insight into the business which to high performance of our executive we also have integration where we manage our own international directly import significant percentage of our inventory and develop and manage our large portfolio of brand in addition we have supply chain complexity with the variety of we offer in our from perishable food to apparel and to electronics and to further include our credit card segment and international expansion which in our segment respect to the retail peer group in all metrics and for our general industry peer group with respect to revenue and

financial performance used under the program and for executive other than our their subjectively determined personal performance level for at goal performance the short term incentive of base salary and for executive of base salary see table below the performance are as profitability incentive incentive is one of two financial performance for under our annual short term incentive program this measurement is designed to reinforce our focus on the growth in our earnings before interest and and for of the financial component of the short term incentive incentive is retail plus credit spread to see credit spread to definition and discussion in item of our annual report on form because the majority of our credit card receivables portfolio interest based on variable interest rate in interest affect finance charge that in turn affect accordingly we adjust to generally eliminate the effect of interest rate either up or down on short term incentive in the goal for fiscal the compensation committee determined to exclude the segment as those consist solely of start up during the performance period investment discipline incentive incentive is the other financial performance measure for under our annual short term incentive program and for the other of the financial component of the short term incentive incentive is measure of earnings after an after tax cost of capital charge and is used to evaluate the degree to which capital is being efficiently the effective tax rate used to calculate incentive is fixed to prevent future tax volatility from an unintended effect on positive incentive performance we are generating on capital at higher than the cost of capital among other our use of incentive us temper the objective of increasing through store construction with measure of how profitably we are in in calculating incentive we use an after tax blended cost of debt and equity capital of for capital used to fund our core retail and approximately for capital used

corp board of prepare report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental of its electronics by providing for take back of all electronics sold reuse of working equipment and export to non of hazardous waste and untested or non working equipment or supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth retailer of consumer electronics and such contain toxic such as lead cadmium flame polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle only about of electronics ready for end of life management are collected for according to environmental protection agency report waste is the growing and most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream more than the collection rate for waste the recovery rate for all municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental and with cathode ray contain large of lead flat screen contain and computer contain cadmium which can be harmful to human health if to the environment electronic goods collected for in the are often shipped by to where they endanger health and the environment harm the high tech of report by action network revealed appalling in the city of china where approximately migrant break apart and process old electronic equipment under primitive openly burn toxic plastics and and melt circuit to extract gold silver and copper these threaten worker health and pollute land and water target corporate responsibility report being responsible steward of the environment is one of the most important that target corporate reputation yet the company does not offer take back for the full range of electronics it and policy to ensure safe disposal of collected the company back small such as music and mobile but does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of electronics it or whether it reuse of working equipment or export of collected electronics need the company is actively how collected goods are believe our company should develop nationwide return program for all electronic it or nearby convenient for all electronics collected by our company should be or by responsible electronics who are independently to meet standard such as the standard competitor best buy back all electronics and downstream service from non working equipment or to and third party provider position of the board of the board of considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our in response to similar proposal last year we our disclosure with respect to our electronics in particular we now address in more detail our responsible for waste our in store program where our go and other to divert waste from at target environment our responsible for waste which we contractually obligate our vendor to follow address several of the by the proponent those include that all are broken down and or for re use all waste domestically and waste from being sent to anywhere in the world monthly by on all and activity which along with site transparency and visibility into vendor our program consideration of whether have met various certification such as the standard in the proposal and the responsible standard the internal and reputation and periodic process and by appropriate target team or third party the vendor responsible for the majority of target waste is independently certified to meet the standard the proposal received this year from last year proposal in that it us to consider expanding the scope of our guest facing program to include all electronics sold our guest facing program already to easily recycle small electronics such as ink and cell as well as glass and plastic and plastic in their local target store in essence the substance of the proposal is to ask us to cover electronics such as game and in our guest facing program we do not believe such an expansive program is common among general merchandise in addition we believe that the nature of more expanded program would be disruptive to our store and less efficient relative to other available to for disposal of such the availability of local government run we do not believe separate report is because we already actively monitor our and disposal for waste above and beyond legal compliance and our program our electronics take back is consistent with if not ahead of among general merchandise based on the above the board that our current approach to waste is appropriate and is in the best interest of target and our the board of that vote against the shareholder proposal on electronics item proposal on use of corporate funds for political or green century equity fund state street suite boston ma which more than of of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved the request that the board of adopt policy the use of corporate funds for any political election or campaign supporting statement prohibit political spending from corporate treasury funds whereas political spending and corporate money in politics is highly contentious issue made more prominent in light of the united supreme court case that to make unlimited political to independent in the election year we expect even more media and public attention to corporate spending to influence predict that an unprecedented amount of money will be spent in the election season recent highlight the public disapproval in june poll of said that have too much influence over the political system today in an news post poll found that opposed united the bipartisan nature of these is striking in these largely partisan corporate political can backfire on corporation reputation and line in target corporation experienced such directly after it received unwanted attention consumer and for its support of controversial candidate in poll in sizable portion of that if there were option they would shop elsewhere if they learned that business they had to candidate or cause that they oppose according to the national institute on money in state politics between and target corporation spent million on company or pac however this figure does not include to trade or other tax exempt that may channel corporate money to political many trade that receive corporate spend vast in electoral politics these are not to be disclosed for example the chamber of commerce to spend between and million in the election season and that it would work to unseat any member of congress who for reform according to public citizen only of in the primary season revealed the of in their federal election commission filings down from nearly percent in the and increasingly such as and are spending of political funds directly or indirectly to influence given the and potential negative impact on shareholder value the believe target corporation should adopt policy to refrain from treasury funds in the political process we believe this policy should include any direct or indirect contribution that is intended to influence the outcome of an election or referendum it should also prohibit the use of trade or non profit from channeling our company or membership to influence the outcome of any election or referendum position of the board of the board of considered this proposal and that its adoption at this time is not in the best of target or our the board the importance of the issue of the role of in public policy following our experience during the election cycle the board

corporate treasury funds for political it determined that complete prohibition of this nature was too absolute and could put target at disadvantage if there ever were when use of corporate funds would
