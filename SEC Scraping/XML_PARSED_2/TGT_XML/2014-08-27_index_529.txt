item of our annual report on form for the fiscal year ended significant disruption in our computer and our inability to adequately maintain and update those could adversely affect our and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer to manage inventory process guest manage guest data communicate with our and other third service and summarize and analyze and on continued and unimpeded access to the to use our computer our are subject to damage or interruption from power computer and malicious security and catastrophic if our are or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement experience data loss and to our ability to manage or process guest and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our of the data

disruption not data breach in june that many of our point of sale from working in limited geographic region this disruption and negative publicity and we engaged in promotional to retain our during the delay we continually make significant technology that will help maintain and update our computer significant system the risk of computer system disruption additionally the potential and associated with technology could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence we experienced significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have significant related to that event our could exceed the we have by material and we can not predict the longer term impact of any loss of confidence of our these could have material adverse impact on our of the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network it is possible that we will identify additional information that was or stolen which could materially worsen the and damage we have experienced for example when the intrusion was initially we thought the information stolen was limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information was also stolen we are currently subject to number of governmental and private litigation and other to the data breach and in the future we may be subject to additional and of this sort we have data breach related that include our probable for these and it is reasonably possible that we may incur material loss in excess of the amount our financial liability from such and will depend on many one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry while that portion of our network was determined to be compliant by an independent third party assessor in the fall of the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card following the data breach that we were not in compliance with those at the time of the data breach another factor is whether and if so to what extent any fraud or other experienced by card and or the payment card on or with respect to the payment card affected by the data breach can be properly to the data breach and whether and if so to what extent such and would in any event be our legal responsibility in addition the governmental investigating the data breach may seek to impose on us and or other monetary relief and or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at competitive disadvantage with other finally we believe that the risk to our business out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our as well as the possibility of participation in our loyalty program which our internal analysis meaningful incremental we experienced than segment after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be long term impact to our relationship with our or whether we will
