protection among could cause our to increase without an ability to pass through any through higher for example we are currently facing government related to the data breach that may result in the imposition of or other in addition any legislative or regulatory adopted in reaction to the recent retail industry data could increase or accelerate our compliance also our pharmacy and clinic are by various and significant change in or our noncompliance with these could have material adverse effect on our compliance and of in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable and wage and hour the foreign corrupt act and local anti bribery we could be subject to legal risk government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our of by increasing our reducing our and lowering our weather where our are may impact consumer shopping which alone or together with natural particularly in where our are concentrated could adversely affect our of

our three by total are and where natural are more prevalent natural in those or in other where our are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our or

adversely affect our net income number of influence our effective income tax rate in tax law tax interpretation of and our ability to sustain our on examination in any of those could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our outside of the united may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and of could suffer we are dependent on stable liquid and well financial system to fund our and capital in particular we have historically on the public debt to fund of our capital and the commercial paper market and bank credit to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these on multiple the condition of debt capital our operating performance and strong debt if rating lower our credit it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt our cost of funds and other for debt each of the credit rating its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use variety of derivative to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price or turmoil in the financial could reduce our ability to meet our capital or fund our working capital needs and lead to on derivative resulting from which could adversely affect our financial position and of significant disruption in our computer and our inability to adequately maintain and update those could adversely affect our and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer to manage inventory process guest manage guest data communicate with our and other third service and summarize and analyze and on continued and unimpeded access to the

impacted our ability to timely handle customer and we experienced than segment following the announcement of the data breach we continually make significant technology that will help maintain and update our computer significant system the risk of computer system disruption additionally the potential and associated with technology could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence if we do not positively differentiate the target experience and appeal to our our financial could be adversely affected in fiscal we target in canada which was our first retail store expansion outside of the united our initial and operating in canada have not met our initial improving our in canada is contingent on our ability to deploy marketing that positively differentiate us from other in canada and achieve market acceptance by in addition our and operating in canada are dependent on our ability to manage our inventory to offer the assortment of merchandise to our while overstock and general in canada if we do not effectively execute our marketing program and manage our inventory in canada our financial could be adversely affected disruption in with third who provide us in connection with certain of our business could adversely affect our we rely on third to support variety of business our supply chain of our technology development and our and distribution network credit and debit card transaction and of credit for our loyalty program if we are unable to contract with third the specialized to support those or integrate their and with our business or if those third fail to meet our performance and with respect to data security our reputation and of could be adversely affected in addition we could face associated with finding replacement or team to provide these in house we experienced significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are not yet able to determine the full extent of its impact and the impact of government and private litigation on our of which could be material the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network our investigation of the matter is ongoing and it is possible that we will identify additional information that was or stolen which could materially worsen the and damage we have experienced for example when the intrusion was initially we thought the information stolen was limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information was also stolen we are currently subject to number of governmental and private litigation and other to the data breach and in the future we may be subject to additional and of this sort these and could have material adverse impact on our of or profitability our financial liability from such and will depend on many one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry while that portion of our network was determined to be compliant by an independent third party assessor in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card to claim that we were not in compliance another factor is whether and if so to what extent any fraud or other experienced by card and or the payment card on or with respect to the payment card affected by the data breach can be properly to the data breach and whether and if so to what extent it would in any event be our legal responsibility in addition the governmental investigating the data breach may seek to impose on us and or other monetary relief and or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at competitive disadvantage with other finally we believe that the risk to our business out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our as well as the possibility of participation in our loyalty program which our internal analysis meaningful incremental we experienced than segment after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be long term impact to our relationship with our or whether

call and procure legal and other professional the million of fourth quarter also an accrual related to the payment card by reason of the data breach the ultimate amount of these will likely include for incremental counterfeit fraud and non ordinary course operating such as card that the payment card believe they or their issuing have in order for us to have liability for such we believe that court would have to find among other that at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was with applicable data security in manner that to the data breach and the network operating around reimbursement of operating and counterfeit fraud are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those at the time of the data breach we base that expectation on our understanding that in like ours where prior to data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent third party assessor to be fully compliant with those the network forensic investigator nonetheless regularly that the entity was not in fact compliant with those as result we believe it is probable that the payment card will make against us we expect to dispute the payment card and we think it is likely that our would lead to settlement consistent with the experience of other that have similar payment card we believe such would effect combined settlement of both the payment card counterfeit fraud loss and their non ordinary course operating expense we based our year end accrual on the expectation of reaching of the payment card and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these were they to be currently we can only reasonably estimate loss associated with of the for non ordinary course operating the year end accrual does not include any associated with the for incremental counterfeit fraud because the loss associated with settling such while probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received third party fraud from the payment card we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible in excess of the year end accrual related to the settlement of the payment card because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal to be resolved we believe that the ultimate amount on payment card network could be material to our of in future litigation and governmental addition more than have been in in many and other have been or may be against us on behalf of payment card issuing or seeking damages or other related relief allegedly out of the data breach state and federal the state general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating related to the data breach how it its and our although we are in these we may be subject to or other which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our of while loss from these is reasonably possible we can not reasonably estimate range of possible because our investigation into the matter is ongoing the remain in the early damages have not been there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of class or classes being certified or the ultimate of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal to be resolved further we do not believe that loss from these is probable therefore we have not loss contingency liability for litigation and governmental in the fourth quarter see note of the to consolidated financial included in item financial and supplementary data future expect to incur significant investigation legal and professional associated with the data breach in future we will recognize these as are received we also expect to incur additional associated with incremental fraud and on target insurance limit our exposure to data breach we maintain million of network security insurance coverage above million deductible this coverage and certain other insurance coverage may reduce our exposure we will pursue to the maximum extent available under the as of we have million receivable for we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage which partially the million of expense to the data breach future capital plan to accelerate previously investment of approximately million to equip our proprietary and all of our store card with chip smart card technology by the first quarter of in addition we may accelerate or make additional in our information technology but we are unable to estimate such because the nature and scope not yet

analysis of and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial prepared in accordance with preparation of these consolidated financial us to make and affecting the of assets and at the date of the consolidated financial of and during the period and related of contingent assets and in the to consolidated financial we describe the significant accounting used in the consolidated financial our are on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other that we believe to be reasonable under the actual could differ under other or however we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future or our senior management the development and selection of our critical accounting with the audit committee of our board of the following in our consolidated financial require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of under this method inventory is stated at cost the last in first out lifo method as determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value the cost of our inventory the amount we pay to our to acquire inventory freight in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution and and import reduced by vendor income and cash the majority of our distribution operating compensation and are to cost of in the period since inventory value is regularly to reflect market our inventory methodology the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for related to shrink and our shrink estimate is based on historical by physical inventory historically our actual physical inventory count have shown our to be reliable for clearance activity are when the salability of the merchandise inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic change consumer demand guest consumer credit or increasing competition we believe these are largely because our inventory typically turns in less than three inventory was and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial vendor income receivable cost of and are partially offset by various of consideration received from our this vendor income is for variety of vendor such as volume markdown and advertising as well as for our compliance we establish receivable for the vendor income that is but not yet received based on the in place this receivable is by when we have our performance and when the amount is the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the used in our estimate will change significantly historically to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was million and million at and respectively and is further in note of the to consolidated financial long lived assets long lived assets are for impairment whenever or in indicate that the carrying may not be recoverable the evaluation is at the level of identifiable cash independent of other assets an impairment loss would be when undiscounted future cash from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured cash or independent of value as appropriate we of million million and million in and respectively and are further in note as of percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not material upon sale of long lived assets insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain associated with these include of both and but not yet we use actuarial which consider number of to estimate our ultimate cost of general liability and compensation are at our estimate of their net present value other to above are not our compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at and respectively we believe that the are appropriate however our could be significantly affected if future or loss differ from our for example percent increase or decrease in average claim would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically to our have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative about market risk for further disclosure of the market associated with these we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain network security as of we have million insurance recovery receivable to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable however it is possible that the insurance could dispute our and that we may be unable to collect the receivable income we pay income based on the tax and case law of the various in which we operate significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible and taxable and in the ultimate resolution of tax in dispute with tax the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after it is likely the uncertain tax would withstand challenge by taxing we periodically reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate for uncertain tax interest and were million and million at and respectively we believe the resolution of these will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial as of we had foreign net operating loss of million which are available to offset future income these are primarily related to the start up of the segment and expire between and we establish valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that we believe will not be we have the positive and negative evidence and consider it more likely than not that these will be fully prior to expiration therefore we have not established valuation allowance income are further in note of the to consolidated financial pension and health care accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded and health care plan for certain current and retired team the for these are determined based on actuarial the in the following eligibility and the level of depending on team full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these are determined based on actuarial about the long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth the used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with made for any significant plan or participant our long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market our compound annual rate of return on qualified assets was percent percent the year year year and year respectively one percentage point decrease in our long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit is annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate for that are in line with the duration of our pension our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with in interest percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team than it does for older longer service pension eligible team pension and health care are further in note of the to consolidated financial legal and other we are exposed to other and litigation in the ordinary course of business and use various to resolve these in manner that we believe the best interest of our and other when loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the amount in the range of loss and disclose the range we do not record for reasonably possible loss but do disclose range of reasonably possible if they are material and we are able to estimate such range if we can not provide range of reasonably possible we explain the that prevent us from such range historically to our have not been material we believe the in our consolidated financial properly reflect loss that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of data breach related loss we do not believe any of the currently or litigation will materially affect our of cash or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent and unfavorable could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the of cash or financial condition for the period in which the ruling or future for data breach related we are unable to reasonably estimate range of probable loss in excess of the payment card network contingent we believe that from the payment card in excess of the in fiscal are reasonably possible and that these could be material to our of in future but we are unable to estimate range of such reasonably possible we are also unable to estimate range of reasonably possible from data breach related litigation and governmental see item discussion and analysis of financial condition and of and note of the to the consolidated financial included in item financial and supplementary data for further information on the data breach related accounting do not expect that any recently accounting will have material effect on our financial forward looking report forward looking which are based on our current and these are typically by the expect may could believe would might or of similar import the principal forward looking in this report include our financial performance regarding the adequacy of and associated with our of liquidity the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset the continued execution of our share repurchase program our capital the impact of in the effective income tax rate on net income the compliance with debt the impact of accounting our regarding future and related to our pension and health care the on pension plan assets the effects of the adequacy of our for general liability compensation and property loss the outcome of and adequacy of our for and litigation those related to the data breach insurance to our contractual the ability to recognize deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss and the resolution of tax all such forward looking are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking in the private litigation reform act of as although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking our actual could be materially different the most important which could cause our actual to differ from our forward looking are set forth on our description of risk in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking in this report forward looking speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative about market our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate on our debt some of which are at plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to the extent by which our floating rate debt differ from our floating rate short term at our floating rate debt our floating rate short term by approximately billion as result based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point increase in floating interest on our floating rate debt net of our short term would be to decrease earnings before income by approximately million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term over time but that may vary in different interest rate see further description of our debt and derivative in and of the to consolidated financial we record our general liability and compensation at net present value therefore these fluctuate with in interest periodically in certain interest rate we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate by entering into interest rate forward that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in interest would be to decrease earnings before income by million in addition we are exposed to market return on our qualified defined benefit pension percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million the value of our pension is inversely related to in interest to protect against in interest we hold high quality long duration and interest rate in our pension plan trust at year end we had percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully in note and note of the to consolidated financial we are exposed to market on team member in our unfunded deferred compensation we control the risk of offering the by making in life insurance and forward on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the on these the effect of one percentage point change in market on our defined contribution inclusive of the effect of the

counterfeit fraud and non ordinary course operating such as card that the payment card believe they or their issuing have in order for us to have liability for such we believe that court would have to find among other that at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was with applicable data security in manner that to the data breach and the network operating around reimbursement of operating and counterfeit fraud are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security in the fall of we expect the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card nonetheless to claim that we were not in compliance with those at the time of the data breach we base that expectation on our understanding that in like ours where prior to data breach the entity suffering the breach had been found by an independent third party assessor to be fully compliant with those the network forensic investigator nonetheless regularly that the entity was not in fact compliant with those as result we believe it is probable that the payment card will make against us we expect to dispute the payment card and we think it is probable that our would lead to settlement consistent with the experience of other that have similar payment card we believe such would effect combined settlement of both the payment card counterfeit fraud loss and their non ordinary course operating expense we based our year end accrual on the expectation of reaching of the payment card and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable on these were they to be currently we can only reasonably estimate loss associated with of the for non ordinary course operating the year end accrual does not include any associated with the for incremental counterfeit fraud because the loss associated with settling such while probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received third party fraud from the payment card we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible in excess of the year end accrual related to the settlement of the payment card because the investigation into the matter is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal to be resolved we believe that it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount on payment card network could be material to our of in future litigation and governmental addition more than have been in in many and other have been or may be against us on behalf of payment card issuing or seeking damages or other related relief allegedly out of the data breach state and federal the state general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating related to the data breach how it its and our although we are in these we may be subject to or other while loss from these is reasonably possible we can not reasonably estimate range of possible because our investigation into the matter is ongoing the remain in the early damages have not been there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of class or classes being certified or the ultimate of any class if certified and there are significant factual and legal to be resolved further we do not believe that loss from these is probable therefore we have not loss contingency liability for litigation and governmental in we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for at the time or when it is both probable that loss been and the amount of the loss is

believe that court would have to find among other that at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was with applicable data security in manner that to the data

the payment card will make against us we expect to dispute the payment card and we think it is probable that our would lead to settlement consistent with the experience of other that have similar

probable in our judgment is not reasonably estimable in part because we have not yet received third party fraud from the payment card we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible in excess

nonetheless regularly that the entity was not in fact compliant with those as result we believe it is probable that the payment card will make against us we expect to dispute the payment card and we
