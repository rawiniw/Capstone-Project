covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these additionally as of no or acceleration of payment upon credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding allow the note to put the to us if within matter of of each other we experience both change in control and our long term credit are either reduced and the resulting rating is grade or our long term credit are on watch for possible reduction and those are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is grade we believe our of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain finance expansion and strategic fund debt
