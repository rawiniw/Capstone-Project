significant accounting used in the consolidated financial our management the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting with the audit finance committee of our board of the following require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for related to shrink and our shrink estimate is based on historical by physical inventory historically our actual physical inventory count have shown our to be reliable market for are when the salability of the merchandise we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely because our inventory typically turns in less than three inventory was and respectively and is further in note of the financial vendor income we receive various of consideration from our vendor income principally as result of volume markdown and advertising substantially all vendor income is as reduction of cost of we establish receivable for vendor income that is but not yet received based on the in place this receivable is by when we have our performance and when the amount is the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the used in our estimate will change significantly historically to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was million at and respectively vendor income is further in note of the financial long lived assets long lived assets are for impairment whenever or in indicate that the carrying may not be recoverable the evaluation is at the level of identifiable cash independent of other assets an impairment loss would be when undiscounted future cash from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured cash or independent of value as appropriate we of million million and and respectively which are further in note of the financial goodwill we perform an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if or occur that would indicate reduced fair value in our unit could exist typically we perform qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the fair value of during our qualitative assessment we make significant and but not limited to the industry and market cost product and overall financial performance of the company in our share price and relevant company specific if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the fair value of we perform the first step of the impairment process which the fair value of the unit to its carrying amount we have not been to perform quantitative analysis of goodwill in or we million impairment of goodwill in related to the wind down of insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental however we

general liability and compensation are at our estimate of their net present value other to above are not our compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at and respectively we believe that the are appropriate however our could be significantly affected if future or loss differ from our for example increase or decrease in average claim would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically to our have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative about market risk for further disclosure of the market associated with these we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain network security income we pay income based on the tax and case law of the various in which we operate significant judgment is in the timing and of deductible

for the application of topic income in the period in which the president the tax act into law note of the financial additional information the of uncertain tax are in our financial only after it is likely the uncertain tax would withstand challenge by taxing we periodically reassess these and record any in the financial as appropriate for uncertain tax interest and were million and million at and respectively and primarily relate to we believe the resolution of these will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial income are further in note of the financial pension accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded for certain current and retired team the for these are determined based on actuarial the in the following eligibility and the level of depending on team full time or part time status date of hire age and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these are determined based on actuarial about the long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth the with made for any significant plan or participant are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market one percentage point decrease in our long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit is annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate for that are in line with the duration of our pension our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with in interest percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team than it does for older longer service pension eligible team pension are further in note of the financial legal and other we believe the in our consolidated financial properly reflect loss that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently or litigation may materially affect our of cash or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent and unfavorable could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the of cash or financial condition for the period in which the ruling or future refer to note of the financial for further information on accounting to note note note and note of the financial for description of accounting related to pension expense and other comprehensive income respectively we do not expect any other recently accounting will have material effect on our financial forward looking report forward looking which are based on our current and these are typically by the expect may could believe would might or of similar import the principal forward looking in this report include our financial performance regarding the adequacy of and associated with our of liquidity the impact of the pharmacy transaction on our financial performance the continued execution of our share repurchase program our capital and lease the impact of in the

looking are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking in the private litigation reform act of as although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking our actual could be materially different the most important which could cause our actual to differ from our forward looking are set forth on our description of risk in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking in this report forward looking speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative about market our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate on our debt some of which are at plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to between our floating rate debt to our floating rate short term at our floating rate short term our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point increase in floating interest on our floating rate debt net of our floating rate short term would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term over time but that may vary in different interest rate see further description of our debt and derivative in and to the financial we record our general liability and compensation at net present value therefore these fluctuate with in interest based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in interest would be to decrease earnings before income by million in addition we are exposed to market return on our qualified defined benefit pension the value of our pension is inversely related to in interest percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect against in interest we hold high quality long duration and interest rate in our pension plan trust at year end we had percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully in and to the financial we are exposed to market on team member in our unfunded deferred compensation we control the risk of offering the by making in life insurance and forward on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the on these the effect of one percentage point change in market on our
