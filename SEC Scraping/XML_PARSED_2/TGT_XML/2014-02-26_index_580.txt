and with respect to data security our reputation and of could be adversely affected in addition we could face associated with finding replacement or team to provide these in house we experienced significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal and are not yet able to determine the full extent of its impact and the impact of government and private litigation on our of which could be material the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network our investigation of the matter is ongoing and it is possible that we will identify additional information that was or stolen which could materially worsen the and damage we have experienced for example when the intrusion was initially we thought the information stolen was limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information was also stolen significant factor in our financial liability is whether our were in compliance with applicable payment card industry while our were determined to be compliant by third party in the fall of the are inherently subjective and the extent of compliance is subject to another factor in the amount of any liability is the extent of actual fraud experienced by affected card or other which will not be known to us for several or in addition the governmental investigating the data breach may seek to impose injunctive relief which could materially increase our data security adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at competitive disadvantage with other finally we believe that the risk to our business out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our as well as the possibility of participation in our loyalty program which our internal analysis meaningful incremental we experienced than segment after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be long term impact to our relationship with our or whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other to regain their trust which could have material
