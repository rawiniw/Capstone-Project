the executive as in the tabular and other narrative executive compensation in this proxy statement effect of item the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this item by will not require the board or the human compensation committee to take any action regarding executive compensation the final decision on the compensation and of our executive and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the human compensation committee the board that the human compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation and that are in the best of target and its the board the of as expressed through their and other although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder received from other when making future compensation target corporation proxy statement back to contents shareholder proposal to adopt policy for an independent chairman nelson avenue no beach ca who more than of of common stock on to submit the following resolution to for approval at the annual meeting the language below in the proposal and supporting statement is without alteration proposal proposal independent board chairman request our board of to adopt as policy and amend our governing as necessary to require henceforth that the chair of the board of whenever possible to be an independent member of the board the board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next transition so it does not violate any agreement if the board that chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select chair who the of the policy within reasonable amount of time compliance with this policy is if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chairman this proposal that all the necessary be taken to accomplish the above supporting statement caterpillar is an example of company recently course and naming an independent board chairman caterpillar had strongly opposed shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman as recently as its annual meeting also course and an independent board chairman in it was that of the standard separate these report chairman and this proposal topic won plus support at major in support at this proposal topic received support at the target annual meeting this support was more impressive since it was without small the same access to corporate governance information as large board chairman who is independent of management is practice that will promote greater management accountability to and lead to more objective evaluation of management an independent chairman is more important at target since our lead director baker received as many negative as certain other target plus baker is well as in position at another company for target this is somewhat like to lead director who is member of the same club perhaps not in the best interest of baker may also be as and as director at total of plus baker the target nomination committee and was member of the target executive pay committee maybe not so good because an might be predisposed to raise the pay of brother meanwhile received as many negative as certain other target please vote to enhance the oversight of our independent board chairman proposal target corporation proxy statement back to contents position of the board of the board that any decision to maintain combined chair role or to separate these should be based on specific the independence and of its and the leadership provided by its the board does not believe that separating the of chair and should be or that such separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for the board fiduciary duty to act as it to be in the best of target and its in order to meet that duty the board it is important to maintain the flexibility to determine which leadership structure best those as evolve the offer to phase in the mandatory independent chair policy for the next transition the importance of that flexibility by form of board leadership to an unknown set of that would apply in the future when the next transition the proposal will unnecessarily limit the in recruiting successor and the leadership structure it is in the best of target and its at that time the board that its current leadership structure and governance allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically our corporate governance require us to have lead independent director with significant that are in detail on page whenever the of chair and are combined as they are currently our lead independent director is annually by the independent non employee independent meet frequently in executive sessions that are over by our lead independent director with no of management present independent use these executive sessions to discuss of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate evaluation of the and other senior management management succession to be included on board board informational needs and board effectiveness the all the audit finance governance and human compensation are independent these board committee determine to be and to be in the covered by their respective committee the board regularly its board leadership structure as part of the board evaluation process under board and refreshment on page and also does so at the time of any leadership the mandatory policy would eliminate that important board responsibility and the ability to determine the most effective form of leadership structure even though the proposal been consistently by less than majority of in the past the topic of this proposal most recently went to vote at the target annual meeting when it received support of the through shareholder engagement since that vote we have continued to find that although express different on their preferred leadership structure there is no theme on preferred structure for target the board is to to seek shareholder feedback on its approach as part of its ongoing shareholder outreach and will continue to reassess its approach to this issue on regular basis the board of that vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt policy for an independent chairman
