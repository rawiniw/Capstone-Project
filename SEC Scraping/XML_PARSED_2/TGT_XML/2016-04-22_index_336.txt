gross benefit that would result from this activity within would be inconsistent with the intent and nature of the for these we believe that recording these within with disclosure appropriately the intent and nature of the tell us the key used in your cash flow analysis in the fair value of the leasehold interest we engaged third party valuation specialist to assist us in the fair value of the leasehold interest we used the income approach cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the leasehold interest our location by location analysis used the revenue and expense for each pharmacy and clinic over the lease term because each space by is store within store with no separate entrance we do not believe the cost and market are appropriate due to the absence of reliable building and other data we used the following key lease the agreement is perpetual we used the average accounting useful of our store building portfolio to establish an lease term of initial market initial market rent on triple net basis by multiplying by an occupancy cost percentage on store by store basis the occupancy cost percentage was based on public company filings of national chain drug pharmacy retail and other market data in the we noted that national chain drug over square have occupancy ranging from percent to percent generally the the retailer the lower the occupancy cost percentage target are typically square or therefore we believe an assumption below the of this range is most appropriate for this reason we used percent base occupancy cost percentage with minor made to individual based on prescription volume property type clinic non clinic and location suburban urban annual rent growth applied an annual rent growth rate of percent based on market data the market data that an acceptable amount could be in the range from percent to percent with an average of percent because most of the are suburban that typically have lower annual rent than urban we believe an amount slightly below the average is appropriate discount used an percent discount rate based on market data national chain drug pharmacy retail business capitalization to reflect the store within store concept we believe that each of these was appropriate and well within reasonable range of possible pension and health care page with reference to the specific authoritative guidance on which you please tell us the basis in for your accounting for the discontinuance of the health and recognition of the curtailment gain during response to comment in the third quarter of we and the discontinuance of our unfunded health care plan effective we for the plan as negative plan amendment and curtailment as in because the in reduction of to employee service already and eligibility of significant number of previously to receive in accordance with the effects were applied as of the plan amendment date because we the to plan within reasonable period of time in accordance with we the plan obligation resulting in million reduction in the health care benefit obligation and corresponding million reduction in the net actuarial in other comprehensive income we then million reduction in the for the negative plan amendment that the reduction in the would first reduce any unamortized prior service cost in then reduce any transition obligation in and any excess would be as component of net periodic benefit cost at the date of the amendment million of unamortized negative prior service cost and no unamortized transition obligation after the additional negative prior service cost resulting from the current amendment unamortized prior service cost million in accordance with the impact of accounting for the curtailment is limited to the recognition of the portion of negative prior service cost included in other comprehensive income related to those who are no longer eligible for future the million gain was not offset by other effects of the curtailment and therefore was as income during the quarter ended we the million of negative prior service cost over the six month life of the plan we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing that staff or to
