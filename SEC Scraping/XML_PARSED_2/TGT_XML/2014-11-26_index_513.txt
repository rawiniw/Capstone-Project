counterfeit fraud and non ordinary course operating such as card that the payment card believe they or their issuing have as result of the event for us to have liability for such we believe that court

operating around reimbursement of operating and counterfeit fraud are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that payment card data to be compliant with

believe it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make claim against us we expect to dispute the that have been or may be made against us by the payment card and we think it

because the used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long of time we may be unable to anticipate these or implement adequate preventive in addition hardware or we develop or procure from third may contain in design or manufacture or other that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized may also attempt to gain access to our or or those of third with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other of deceiving our team and temporary staff until the fourth quarter of all we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced was significant and went undetected for several we experienced than segment immediately following the announcement of the data breach and we are currently facing more than civil on behalf of payment card issuing or seeking damages or other related relief allegedly out of the data breach in addition state and federal state general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating related to the data breach how it its and our those and may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our of both we and our have experienced data security other than the data breach however to date these other have not been material to our consolidated financial if we or our experience additional significant data security or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security we could be exposed to additional government enforcement and private litigation in addition our could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue our or pharmacy or stop shopping with us altogether significant disruption in our computer and our inability to adequately maintain and update those could adversely affect our and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer to manage inventory process guest manage guest data communicate with our and other third service and summarize and analyze and on continued and unimpeded access to the to use our computer our are subject to damage or interruption from power computer and malicious security and catastrophic if our are or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement experience data loss and to our ability to manage or process guest and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our of the data breach we experienced negatively impacted our ability to timely handle customer and we experienced than segment following the announcement of the data breach similarly we experienced temporary network disruption not data breach in june that many of our point of sale from working in limited geographic region this disruption and negative publicity and we engaged in promotional to retain our during the delay we continually make significant technology that will help maintain and update our computer significant system the risk of computer system disruption additionally the potential and associated with technology could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence we experienced significant data security breach in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have significant related to that event our could exceed the we have by material and we can not predict the longer term impact of any loss of confidence of our these could have material adverse impact on our of the data breach we experienced involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network it is possible that we will identify additional information that was or stolen which could materially worsen the and damage we have experienced for example when the intrusion was initially we thought the information stolen was limited to payment card information but later discovered that other guest information was also stolen we are currently subject to number of governmental and private litigation and other to the data breach and in the future we may be subject to additional and of this sort we have data breach related that include our probable for these and it is reasonably possible that we may incur material loss in excess of the amount our financial liability from such and will depend on many one of which is whether at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that payment card data was in compliance with applicable payment card industry while that portion of our network was determined to be compliant by an independent third party assessor in the fall of the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card following the data breach that we were not in compliance with those at the time of the data breach another factor is whether and if so to what extent any fraud or other experienced by card and or the payment card on or with respect to the payment card affected by the data breach can be properly to the data breach and whether and if so to what extent such and would in any event be our legal responsibility in addition the governmental investigating the data breach may seek to impose on us and or other monetary relief and or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put us at competitive disadvantage with other finally we believe that the risk to our business out of the data breach is the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our as well as the possibility of participation in our loyalty program which our internal analysis meaningful incremental we experienced than segment after the announcement of the data breach but are unable to determine whether there will be long term impact to our relationship with our or whether we will need to engage in significant additional promotional or other to regain their trust which could have material adverse impact on our of or profitability item unregistered of equity and use of table below information with respect to target common stock made during the three ended by target
