qualified stated interest more than one accrual period the amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval is on pro rata basis to each accrual period in the interval and the issue price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval must be by the amount of any qualified stated interest that prior to the beginning of the first day of the accrual period but is not payable until the end of the interval if the accrual period is the final accrual period the amount of allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity other than payment of qualified stated interest and the issue price of the debt security at the beginning of the final accrual period and if all accrual are of equal length except for an initial

be from the time of issuance as maturity date for federal income tax on such redemption date if such redemption would result in higher yield to maturity if the exercise of such an option does not

are to report to the the amount of in respect of debt by other than and other exempt debt with contingent the tax treatment of holder of debt security providing for contingent will depend on number of the amount and timing of any contingent of principal and interest this summary does not address the tax treatment of contingent payment debt prospective of debt providing for contingent that do not

term debt in the case of debt that have fixed maturity of one year or less short term debt all all of stated interest will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity and will not be qualified stated interest the short term debt will be for federal income tax as been with in the amount of the difference between their issue price and stated redemption price at maturity unless the holder to compute tax basis instead of issue price in general that use the accrual method of accounting for federal income tax and certain other are to accrue in respect of short term debt into gross

tax are not to accrue on short term debt in advance of the receipt of payment unless they elect to do so if such holder does not elect to accrue on short term debt into gross income then gain subsequently upon the sale retirement or other disposition of the short term debt generally will be as ordinary interest income to the extent of the that through the date of such disposition furthermore non holder of short term debt may be to defer for portion of the holder interest expense with respect to any indebtedness or to purchase or carry the short term debt variable rate debt treasury prescribe special for variable rate debt that provide for the payment of interest based on certain floating or objective in general debt will qualify as variable rate debt variable rate debt if the issue price of the debt does not exceed the total non contingent principal due in respect of the debt by more than an amount equal to the lesser of table of contents by the product of the total non contingent principal and the number of complete to maturity from the issue date or of the total non contingent principal and the debt provide for stated interest or at least annually at current of one or more qualified floating single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating single objective rate or single fixed rate and single objective rate that is qualified inverse floating rate current value of rate is the value of the rate on any date that is no than three prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later than one year following that first day qualified floating rate is any variable rate where in the value of such rate can reasonably be to measure contemporaneous in the cost of newly funds in the currency in which the variable rate debt are although multiple of qualified floating rate generally will not itself constitute qualified floating rate variable rate equal to the product of qualified floating rate and fixed multiple that is greater than but not more than can constitute qualified floating rate variable rate equal to the product of qualified floating rate and fixed multiple that is greater than but not more than or by fixed rate will also constitute qualified floating rate in addition two or more qualified floating that can reasonably be to have approximately the same throughout the term of the variable rate debt two or more qualified floating with within basis of each other as determined on the issue date will be as single qualified floating rate notwithstanding the foregoing variable rate that would otherwise constitute qualified floating rate but which is subject to one or more such as maximum stated interest rate cap minimum stated interest rate floor or restriction on the amount of increase or decrease in the stated interest governor may under certain fail to be as qualified floating rate unless such are fixed throughout the term of the variable rate debt or are reasonably to not have significant effect on the yield of the variable rate debt an objective rate is rate that is not itself qualified floating rate but which is determined single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information rate will not qualify as an objective rate if it is based on information that is within the control of the issuer or related party or that is unique to the of the issuer or related party such as or the value of the issuer stock although rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely because it is based on the credit quality of the issuer an objective rate is qualified inverse floating rate if the rate is equal to fixed rate minus qualified floating rate as long as in the rate can reasonably be to inversely reflect contemporaneous in the qualified floating rate if debt provide for stated interest at fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less by variable rate that is either qualified floating rate or an objective rate and if the variable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate the fixed rate the value of the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the value of the fixed rate by more than basis then the fixed rate and the variable rate together will constitute either single qualified floating rate or objective rate as the case may be if variable rate debt provide for stated interest at either single qualified floating rate or single objective rate throughout their term and such interest is unconditionally payable in cash or property other than debt of the issuer at least annually then all stated interest on such variable rate debt will constitute qualified stated interest that is included in gross income by as received or in accordance with their regular of accounting for federal income tax thus such variable rate debt generally will not be as been with unless the variable rate are sold at discount from their stated principal amount subject to de exception in general the amount of qualified stated interest and if any that during an accrual period on such variable rate debt is table of contents determined under the above by assuming that the variable rate is fixed rate equal to in the case of qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate the value as of the issue date of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate or in the case of an objective rate other than qualified inverse floating rate fixed rate that the yield that is reasonably for the variable rate debt the qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period is or if the interest actually during an accrual period or is less than the interest that was under the foregoing approach for other variable rate debt the timing and amount of and qualified stated interest will be determined by converting the variable rate debt into equivalent fixed rate debt the conversion of the variable rate debt into equivalent fixed rate debt generally substituting for any qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate fixed rate equal to the value of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate as the case may be as of the issue date or substituting for any objective rate other than qualified inverse floating rate fixed rate that the yield that is reasonably for the variable rate debt in the case of variable rate debt that provide for stated interest at fixed rate in addition to either one or more qualified floating or qualified inverse floating rate the fixed rate is initially converted into qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate if the variable rate debt provide for qualified inverse floating rate under such the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate that the fixed rate must be such that the fair market value of the variable rate debt as of their issue date is approximately the same as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument that for either the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate rather than the fixed rate subsequent to converting the fixed rate into either qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate the variable rate debt are then converted into equivalent fixed rate debt in the manner above once the variable rate debt are converted into equivalent fixed rate debt pursuant to the foregoing the timing and amount of and qualified stated interest if any are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt by the general to the equivalent fixed rate debt holder of such variable rate debt will account for and qualified stated interest as if the holder the equivalent fixed rate debt for each accrual period appropriate will be made to the amount of qualified stated interest or assumed to have been or with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt in the event that such differ from the actual amount of interest or on the variable rate debt during the accrual period market discount if holder debt other than debt at original issue at or above the issue price and other than short term debt for an amount that is less than their stated redemption price at maturity or in the case of debt their issue price the amount of the difference will be as market discount for federal income tax unless that difference is less than de amount under the market discount holder generally will be to treat any principal payment and any gain derived from the sale retirement or other disposition of the debt as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that on the debt on ratable basis or at the election of the holder constant yield basis but not previously been included in gross income by the holder in addition holder may be to defer until the maturity of the debt or their disposition in taxable transaction the deduction of all or portion of any interest expense on indebtedness to purchase or carry such debt holder may elect to currently include market discount in gross income as it under either ratable or

holder must include in gross income with respect to the debt for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of acquisition premium properly allocable to such taxable year amortizable bond premium if holder debt for an amount in excess of the sum of all payable on the debt after the purchase date other than of qualified stated interest the holder will be considered to have the debt at premium for federal income tax in such case the holder generally may elect to amortize the premium over the term of the debt on constant yield method as an offset to interest in gross income with respect to the debt and the holder would not be to include if any in gross income in respect of the debt in the case of debt that provide for alternative payment the amount of premium generally is determined by assuming that holder will exercise or not exercise in manner that the holder yield and that the issuer will exercise or not exercise in manner that the holder yield although the issuer will be to exercise or not exercise call option in manner that the holder yield any election to amortize premium would apply to all debt other than debt the interest on which is excludable from gross income or
