spending by professor of long island university that political spending may not benefit and in some could harm line to summarize this report the of large scale literature meta analysis large scale empirical analysis and supplemental all of which strongly indicate that political spending in particular to policy at best an insubstantial impact on their line and more often in negative effect of firm financial performance as noted above are already concerned with the opaque nature of political spending and with good reason the of my empirical analysis alongside the analysis of provide solid

by professor at long island university and working paper by professor at the law school both indicate that are not in favor of corporate political activity these show that that reduce shareholder power are more politically active and that shareholder equity ownership is lower for politically active in comparison to that of non politically active other research the notion that political activity since it performance the above of the large scale analysis specifically the work of and wang at the school of management that money to firm value again may be hurt by political spending the recognize that there are other academic that come to the opposite conclusion but we remain concerned that the above literature review that some political campaign spending does not necessarily enhance shareholder value and in certain could harm it given the inherent to this type of spending and the ambiguity around its financial the proponent target should protect shareholder value by from such spending the proposal would not curtail the ability to engage in the political process ending political from the corporate treasury would assuredly not prevent target from in the political process or its to policy this proposal would not eliminate pac or most of which among most are typically much than political spending from the corporate treasury anyway or the ability of to participate in the

political spending petition for august file no emphasis added submission by professor assistant professor of management long island university to murphy secretary and exchange commission committee on disclosure of corporate political spending petition for august file no emphasis added the only that would be curtailed would be spending on referenda growing number of are making the decision to refrain from of political spending given the growing consumer sentiment opposing corporate influence over the political process and an recognition of the associated an increasing number of are from political campaign spending according to media the are making the determination to refrain from certain political spending is varied some major such as and have taken the position that they will not use corporate funds directly either for independent or for the for this abnegation include the following desire to avoid being constantly battered on all sides for campaign funds by associated with or desire to avoid being caught up in the intensely partisan nature of our current electoral and to present non partisan face to national across the political spectrum lack of skill in political advertising and an understanding that corporate funds may be more effectively spent and public policy after in the congress the executive the regulatory and the recent study by the sustainable institute an increase in the number of that assert they do not spend on politics overall the study found in the fall of up from year have some type of explicit prohibition make no to number doubled growing from last year refrain from giving to political an increase from in reject spending on ballot up from just one in prohibit to up from nine the report acknowledged that there can be disconnect between company policy and and found that only with no spending actually did not give any money to political or in ben tough for on campaign spending business week available at news tough for on campaign spending welsh and robin young corporate governance of political report on sustainable institute and institute the that this clearly that there is growing momentum toward some of all together as result we urge target to take leadership on this issue and refrain from political spending in its entirety conclusion own experience in that political spending can result in to the brand and line in this election year there is focus on the role of corporate money in politics and it is exceedingly difficult to determine what may be as controversial therefore the only way to eliminate the risk is to refrain from all political spending with treasury funds in its opposition statement target that it on thorough review of its and in this area after its experience in and subsequently its the proponent that the company had thoughtful and deliberate on how to best respond to the contribution controversy but that because are risk still furthermore as the academic research growing evidence that corporate political spending does not advance shareholder value and as more and more reject such spending the proponent target to refrain from making corporate with treasury funds this is not
