contents critical accounting our analysis of and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting preparation of these consolidated financial us to make and affecting the of assets and at the date of the consolidated financial of and during the period and related of contingent assets and in the to consolidated financial we describe the significant accounting used in the consolidated financial our are on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other that we believe to be reasonable under the actual could differ under different or however we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future or our senior management the development and selection of our critical accounting with the audit committee of our board of the following in our consolidated financial require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of under this method inventory is stated at cost the last in first out lifo method as determined by cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value cost the purchase price as for vendor income since inventory value is regularly to reflect market our inventory methodology the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for related to shrink and our shrink estimate is based on historical by ongoing physical inventory historically our actual physical inventory count have shown our to be reliable for clearance activity are when the salability of the merchandise inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic change relevant economic include consumer demand customer consumer credit or increasing competition we believe these are largely because our inventory typically turns in less than three inventory is further in note of the to consolidated financial vendor income of and are partially offset by various of consideration received from our this vendor income is for variety of vendor such as volume markdown and advertising as well as for our compliance we establish receivable for the vendor income that is but not yet received based on the in place this receivable is by when we have our performance and when the amount is the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter vendor income is further in note of the to consolidated financial allowance for doubtful receivables are we recognize an allowance for doubtful in an amount equal to future write this allowance for uncollectible finance and other credit related we estimate future write based on historical experience of risk aging and industry risk substantially all continue to accrue finance until they are written off are automatically written off when they become days past due management the allowance for doubtful is adequate to cover in our credit card receivable under current however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the above or in general economic could materially change these credit card receivables are in note of the to consolidated financial analysis of long lived and intangible assets for review assets at the level for which there are identifiable cash usually at the store level on an annual basis or whenever an event or change in the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss on long lived and identifiable intangible asset would be when undiscounted future cash from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment by its carrying value to fair value by future cash this test is at least annually or whenever an event or change in the table of contents carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable impairment on long lived assets of million in million in and million in were as result of the our of future cash require us to make and to apply judgment forecasting future and and useful of the assets these can be affected by such as future store real estate and economic that can be difficult to predict insurance self retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain associated with these include of both and but not yet we estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial general liability and compensation are at our estimate of their net present value other to above are not we believe that the are adequate although actual may differ from the provided refer to item for further disclosure of the market associated with these income pay income based on the tax and case law of the various in which we operate significant judgment is in income tax and in the ultimate resolution of tax in dispute with tax historically our of the ultimate resolution of tax have been materially accurate the current open tax are not dissimilar in or substance from historical we believe the resolution of these will not have material impact on our consolidated financial income are further in note of the to consolidated financial pension and health care fund and maintain qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller and health care plan for certain current and retired team the for these are determined based on actuarial the in the following eligibility for and the level of these depending on team full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service our long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market expense during the year is partially dependent upon the long term rate of return used and percent decrease in the long term rate of return used to determine net pension and health care expense would increase annual expense by approximately million the discount rate used to determine benefit is annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate as of the measurement date for that are in line with the duration of our pension historically this same discount rate also been used to determine net pension and health care expense for the following plan year the discount used to determine benefit and expense are included in note of the to consolidated financial expense during the year is partially dependent upon the discount used and percent decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and health care expense would increase annual expense by approximately million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team than it does for older longer service pension eligible team pension and health care are further in note of the to consolidated financial accounting future in june the no accounting for of financial assets an amendment of statement no in the and accounting which amends the guidance in former statement no and the exemption from consolidation for special purpose this guidance will be effective for the table of contents corporation beginning in fiscal and

applicable to variable interest the will significantly affect the overall consolidation analysis under former interpretation no this guidance will be effective for the corporation beginning in fiscal and adoption is not to affect our consolidated net earnings cash or financial position outlook in the retail segment we expect to generate in comparable store likely in the range of to percent for the year an percentage point lift from our remodel program while our comparable store are easier in the spring than the fall the incremental resulting from will grow as the year additionally we expect total to increase by mid single digit percentage in we expect to generally preserve our rate in our retail segment which if would result in our retail segment increasing in line with total growth in our credit card segment we expect the lower consumer usage of credit and our risk management to continue throughout resulting in low double digit percentage decline in gross credit card receivables by the end of the year we also expect to maintain segment profit on dollar basis at generally the level in generating higher segment in than in we expect our book effective tax rate to approximate our long term structural rate likely in the range of to percent we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization we expect our capital to be in the range of to billion reflective of we will complete in as well as initial spending for our and store our expectation is that our store program will result in approximately and that our store program will be in the range of to due to the early repayment of an august debt maturity the only significant maturity prior to our seasonal working capital peak which typically in or is the million public series borrowing by our credit card receivables due in forward looking this report forward looking which are based on our current and these are typically by the expect may could believe would might or of similar import the principal forward looking in this report include for our retail segment our outlook for merchandise comparable store and for our credit card segment our outlook for year end gross credit card receivables portfolio future write of current receivables profit and the allowance for doubtful on consolidated basis the effective income tax rate the continued execution of our share repurchase program our capital and the number of to be in and the compliance with debt our regarding future the impact of accounting our future share based compensation expense our and benefit related to our pension and health care and the adequacy of our for general liability compensation property loss and team member medical and dental the outcome of and litigation and the resolution of tax all such forward looking are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking in the private litigation reform act of as although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking our actual could be materially different the most important which could cause our actual to differ from our forward looking are set forth on our description of risk in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking in this report forward looking speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement table of contents item quantitative and qualitative about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily from interest rate on our debt some of which are at plus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance at prime based floating rate to manage our net interest we generally maintain of floating rate debt to generate similar in net interest expense as finance charge fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate at the amount of floating rate credit card assets the amount of net floating rate debt by approximately billion as result based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in floating interest on our floating rate debt net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable would be to decrease earnings before income by approximately million see further description in note of the to consolidated financial we record our general liability and compensation at net present value therefore these fluctuate with in interest periodically in certain interest rate we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate by entering into interest rate forward that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate based on our balance sheet position at the effect of percentage point decrease in interest would be to decrease earnings before income by approximately million in addition we are exposed to market return on our qualified defined benefit pension the effect of one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by million at the value of our pension is inversely related to in interest to protect against in interest we hold high quality long duration and interest rate in our pension plan trust at year end we had approximately percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully in note and note of the to consolidated financial we are exposed to market on team member in our unfunded deferred compensation we control the risk of offering the by making in life insurance and forward on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the on these the effect of one percentage point change in market on our defined contribution inclusive of the effect of the investment used to manage our economic
