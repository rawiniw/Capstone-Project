standards board fasb defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists fasb establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value into three levels level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk the assets fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the following is a description of the valuation methods used for assets measured at fair value there have been no changes in methodologies used at december and cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value common stocks the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded mutual funds the fair values of these securities are primarily based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded guaranteed investment contracts the investments include cash and cash equivalents fixed maturity guaranteed investment contracts gics and constant duration gics the fair value of the investments is calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable duration wall street journal gic index rates fair values for variable synthetic gics are calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable swap rates fair values for constant duration synthetic gics are calculated using the market values provided by the external investment managers table of contents collective trusts the collective trust funds are public investment vehicles valued using a net asset value nav provided by the manager of each fund the nav is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding the navs unit price is quoted on a private market that is not active however the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund which are traded on an active market and valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded the significant investment strategies of the funds are as described in the financial statements provided by each fund there are no restrictions on redemptions from these funds retirement date funds retirement date funds are made up of investments in mutual funds custom funds and collective trusts and are valued in a manner consistent with that described above the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement while all the investments of the participating plans are deemed part of the master trust each plan does maintain a separate accounting of its share of the investments in the

necessary the focus of the funds changes from growing assets to generating income and protecting investments as the retirement date approaches income tax status the plan obtained a determination letter dated february in which the internal revenue service stated that the plan as then designed complied with the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code irc the plan administrator believes that the plan currently is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the irc therefore no provision of income taxes has been included in the plans financial statements currently the plan year is under audit by the irs and the plan administrator expects that no issues will be identified as a result of the audit additionally the plan administrator believes the plan is being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the irc and therefore believes that the plan is qualified and the related trust is tax exempt accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the plan and recognize a tax liability or asset if the plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service the plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or asset or disclosure in the financial statements the plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions other than noted above there are currently no audits for any other tax periods in progress the plan administrator believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for the years prior to risks and uncertainties the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market and credit risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the statement of net assets available for benefits plan termination although it
