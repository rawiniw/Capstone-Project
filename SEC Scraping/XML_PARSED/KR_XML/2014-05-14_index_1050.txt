attendance the board of directors held seven meetings in during all incumbent directors attended at least of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and committees on which that director served members of the board are expected to use their best efforts to attend all annual meetings of shareholders all fourteen members then serving on the board attended last years annual meeting compensation consultants the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers in kroger paid that consultant for work performed for the committee kroger on managements recommendation retained the parent and affiliated companies of mercer human resource consulting to provide other services for kroger in for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to insurance claims for which kroger was reimbursed by insurance carriers as claims were adjusted insurance brokerage and bonding commissions and pension consulting kroger also made payments to affiliated companies for insurance premiums that were collected by the affiliated companies on behalf of insurance carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the committee nor the board expressly approved the other services after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the committee determined that the consultant is independent and his work has not raised any conflict of interest because a he was first engaged by the committee before he became associated with mercer b he works exclusively for the committee and not for our management c he does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and d neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services on behalf of kroger no member of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of the company during fiscal year and no member of the compensation committee was formerly an officer of the company or was a party to any disclosable related person transaction involving the company during fiscal year none of the executive officers of the company served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers serving as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of the company board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board of directors is responsible for the overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the boards audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control that exposure the audit committee also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management including krogers chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective committees regarding the management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board in addition to the reports from the committees the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and the ceo address matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by an independent lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr mcmullen as ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls board leadership structure and lead director our board is composed of eleven independent non employee directors and two management directors mr dillon the chairman of the board and our former chief executive officer and mr mcmullen our chief executive officer in addition as provided in our guidelines on issues of corporate governance the board has designated one of the independent directors as lead director the board has established five standing committees audit compensation corporate governance financial policy and public responsibilities each board committee is composed solely of independent directors each with a different independent director serving as committee chair the mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our board along with the independent role of our lead director and our independent board committees benefits kroger and its shareholders the board designates one of the independent directors as a lead director the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving board agendas meeting materials and schedules to confirm the appropriate topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each serving as liaison between the chairman of the board management and the non management directors presiding at the executive sessions of independent directors and at all other meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present calling an executive session of independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication following a request with major shareholders unless otherwise determined by the board the chair of the corporate governance committee is designated as the lead director robert beyer an independent director and the chair of the corporate governance committee is currently our lead director mr beyer is an effective lead director for kroger due to among other things his independence his deep strategic and operational understanding of kroger obtained while serving as a kroger director his insight into corporate governance and his experience on other boards with respect to the roles of chairman and ceo the guidelines provide that the board will determine when it is in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders for the roles to be separated or combined and the board exercises its discretion as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances as part of the succession planning process the guidelines provide that upon the selection of a new chief executive officer the board will determine whether a separation of the offices is appropriate the board believes that the combination or separation of these positions should continue to be considered as part of the succession planning process as was the case in and again in when the roles were separated our board and each of its committees conduct an annual evaluation to determine whether they are functioning effectively as part of this annual self evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders our guidelines provide the flexibility for our board to modify our leadership structure in the future as appropriate we believe that kroger like many u s companies has been well served by this flexible leadership structure compensation discussion and analysis executive compensation overview as one of the largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy remains to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our focus on our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives our compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that align with our business strategy the compensation of our senior executives in fiscal year reflects these principles total compensation for the year is an indicator of how well kroger performed compared to our business plan reflecting how our compensation program responds to business challenges and the marketplace we continue to deliver sales growth and positive earnings results a key metric identical supermarket sales excluding the rd week in and fuel increased from through fiscal we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth net earnings per diluted share were and even after taking into account several items that we believe are necessary to make these results comparable to fiscal our results still exceeded our guidance range in september the board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend by to per share krogers stock price increased in fiscal year the committee believes our management produced outstanding results in measured against increasingly aggressive business plan objectives for sales earnings and our strategic plan the compensation paid to our named executive officers reflected this fact as the annual performance based cash bonus paid out at of bonus potentials the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of the annual cash bonus with an payout in we performed well but did not achieve all of our business plan objectives in all of our business plan goals were exceeded with the exception of our sales goal which fell slightly short resulting in an annual bonus payout that exceeded of potentials in keeping with our overall compensation philosophy we endeavor to ensure that our compensation practices conform to best practices in particular over the past several years we have put in place significant stock ownership guideline levels to reinforce the link between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders adopted claw back policies under which the repayment of bonuses may be required in certain circumstances eliminated tax gross ups adopted the recommendation of shareholders that they be permitted annually on an advisory basis to vote on executive compensation and adopted a policy prohibiting hedging and short sales and restricting pledging of kroger common shares by our officers and directors in addition beginning in fifty percent of the time based equity awards that otherwise would have been granted to the named executive officers as restricted stock have been replaced with performance units that are earned only to the extent that performance objectives are achieved equity compensation awards continue to play an important role in rewarding named executive officers for the achievement of long term business objectives and providing incentives for the creation of shareholder value the following discussion and analysis addresses the compensation of the named executive officers and the factors considered by the committee in setting compensation for the named executive officers and making recommendations to the independent board members in the case of the ceos compensation additional detail is provided in the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosures that follow this discussion and analysis executive compensation objectives the committee has several related objectives regarding compensation first the committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that executive officers play at kroger second some elements of compensation should help align the interests of the officers with your interests as shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers a to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and b to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives in developing compensation programs and amounts to meet these objectives the committee exercises judgment to ensure that executive officer compensation is appropriate and competitive in light of krogers performance and the needs of the business share ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of the officers with your interests as shareholders the board of directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines require non employee directors officers and some other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger common shares the guidelines require the ceo to acquire and maintain ownership of kroger shares equal to five times his base salary the chief operating officer at four times his base salary executive vice presidents senior vice presidents and non employee directors at three times their base salaries or annual base cash retainers and other officers and key executives at two times their base salaries covered individuals are expected to achieve the target level within five years of appointment to their position kroger shares including equity awards from kroger may not be sold by covered individuals prior to achieving holdings required by the guidelines other than to pay for the exercise price of options and the taxes associated with equity awards without the approval of krogers ceo results of advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting of shareholders we held our third annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory proposal in the committee considered this overwhelmingly favorable outcome and believes it conveys our shareholders support of the committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs as a result the committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs or pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting of shareholders in keeping with our shareholders request for an annual advisory vote we will again hold a vote to approve executive compensation see page the committee will continue to consider the results from this years and future advisory votes on executive compensation role of compensation committee the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of krogers executive officers including the named executive officers with the exception of the chief executive officer the committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those independent board members establish the ceos compensation establishing executive compensation the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos salary the bonus potential for the ceo the nature and amount of any equity awards made to the ceo and any other compensation questions related to the ceo in setting the annual bonus potential for the ceo the independent directors determine the dollar amount that will be multiplied by the percentage payout under the annual bonus plan generally applicable to all corporate management including the named executive officers the independent directors retain discretion to reduce the percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive the independent directors thus make a separate determination annually concerning both the ceos bonus potential and the percentage of bonus paid the committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other named executive officers the committees annual review of compensation for the named executive officers includes the following conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the named executive officers on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each named executive officer of salary annual performance based cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation equity accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits severance benefits available under the kroger co employee protection plan and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the committee has assured itself that the compensation of krogers ceo and that of the other named executive officers bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the committees compensation consultants described below comparing named executive officer and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies primarily our competitors to ensure that the committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary bonus potential and equity awards for each of the senior officers including the other named executive officers the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team looks at historical information regarding salary bonus and equity compensation for a year period in considering each of the factors above the committee does not make use of a formula but rather subjectively reviews each in setting compensation the committees compensation consultants and benchmarking as referenced earlier in this compensation discussion and analysis the committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target annual performance based bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual bonus annualized long term incentive awards such as stock options restricted shares and performance based long term cash bonuses and performance based equity awards and total direct compensation the sum of all these elements the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded food and drug retailers for the group consisted of costco wholesale supervalu cvs caremark target rite aid wal mart safeway walgreens this peer group is the same group as was used in the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant industry consolidation and other competitive forces will change the peer group used over time the consultant also provides the committee data from companies in general industry a representation of major publicly traded companies these data are reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector in the committee directly engaged an additional compensation consultant to conduct a review of krogers executive compensation this consultant from frederic w cook co inc examined the compensation philosophy peer group composition annual cash bonus and long term incentive compensation including equity awards the consultant concluded that krogers executive compensation program met the committees objectives and that it provides a strong linkage between pay and performance the committee expects to engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the committee believes that salaries paid to our executive officers should be at or above the median paid by competitors for comparable positions the committee also aims to provide an annual bonus potential to our executive officers that if the increasingly more challenging annual business plan objectives are achieved would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our named executive officers is comprised of the following salary performance based annual cash bonus annual non equity incentive pay performance based long term compensation long term cash and performance unit incentive compensation other equity non qualified stock options and restricted stock retirement and other benefits and perquisites salary we provide our named executive officers and other employees a fixed amount of cash compensation salary for their work salaries for named executive officers with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by the independent directors salaries for the named executive officers were reviewed in june the amount of each executives salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the committee or in the case of the ceo of the committee and the rest of the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure and relationship with the salaries of other executives at kroger the assessment of individual contribution is based on a subjective determination without the use of performance targets in the following areas leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the amounts shown below reflect the salaries of the named executive officers in effect following the annual review of their compensation in june salaries david b dillon w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman kathleen s barclay paul w heldman michael l ellis mr mcmullens salary increased to effective with his promotion to ceo on january ms barclay became a named executive officer in mr ellis became a named executive officer in his salary increased to effective with his promotion to president and coo on january performance based annual cash bonus a large percentage of our employees at all levels including the named executive officers are eligible to receive a performance based annual cash bonus based on the performance of kroger in the case of the named executive officers or business unit in the case of employees in our business units the committee establishes bonus potentials for each executive officer other than the ceo whose bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts which can exceed of the potential amounts but may not exceed of the potential amounts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the thresholds established by the committee the committee considers several factors in making its determination or recommendation as to bonus potentials first the individuals level within the organization is a factor in that the committee believes that more senior executives should have a substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance second the individuals salary is a factor so that a substantial portion of a named executive officers total cash compensation is dependent upon krogers performance finally the committee considers the reports of its compensation consultants to assess the bonus potential of the named executive officers in light of total compensation paid to comparable executive positions in the industry the annual cash bonus potential in effect following the annual review of compensation in june for each named executive officer is shown below actual bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual bonus potential david b dillon w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman kathleen s barclay paul w heldman michael l ellis mr mcmullens annual bonus potential increased to effective with his promotion to ceo on january ms barclay became a named executive officer in mr ellis became a named executive officer in his annual bonus potential increased to effective with his promotion to president and coo on january over time the committee and our independent directors have placed an increased emphasis on our strategic plan by making the target more difficult to achieve the bonus plan allows for minimal bonus to be earned at relatively low levels of performance to provide incentive for achieving even higher levels of performance the amount of bonus that the named executive officers earn each year is determined by krogers performance compared to targets established by the committee and our independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors in one third of the bonus was based on a target for identical sales without fuel one third was based on a target for ebitda without fuel and one third was based on implementation and results of a set of measures under our strategic plan an additional would be earned if kroger achieved three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations achievement of the targeted fuel ebitda increase of at least in total gallons sold and achievement of the planned number of fuel centers placed in service following the close of the year the committee reviewed krogers performance against the identical sales without fuel ebitda without fuel and strategic plan objectives and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives krogers ebitda without fuel for was billion and krogers identical sales without fuel for were in krogers supermarket fuel ebitda was million which exceeded the goal of million necessary to earn a bonus for the fuel component krogers fuel gallon sales in supermarket fuel centers were billion gallons or over the prior year we operated supermarket fuel centers as of the end of exceeding our goal of centers as a result the payout percentage included the additional fuel bonus due to our performance when compared to the targets established by the committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors the named executive officers earned of their bonus potentials this is the same bonus percentage payout received by all other participants in the annual corporate bonus plan the targets established by the committee for annual bonus amounts based on identical sales without fuel and ebitda without fuel results the actual results and the bonus percentage earned in each of the components of named executive officer bonus were as follows targets component minimum result amount earned identical sales without fuel ebitda without fuel billion billion billion strategic plan fuel bonus as described in the text above total earned payout is at if identical sales goal is achieved the strategic plan component also was established by the committee but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive in as in all years the committee retained discretion to reduce the bonus payout for all executive officers including the named executive officers if the committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus those bodies also retained discretion to adjust the targets under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year no adjustments were made to the targets in the committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo determined that the bonus payouts for the named executive officers should remain the same as other participants the percentage paid for represented excellent performance that exceeded our business plan objectives a comparison of bonus percentages for the named executive officers in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation annual cash bonus fiscal year percentage the actual amounts of annual performance based cash bonuses paid to the named executive officers for are reported in the summary compensation table under the heading non equity incentive plan compensation and footnote these amounts represent the bonus potentials for each named executive officer multiplied by the payout percentage earned in in no event can any participant receive a performance based annual cash bonus in excess of the maximum amount that a participant including each named executive officer can earn is further limited to of the participants bonus potential amount the performance based annual cash bonus for will be determined based on krogers performance against the identical sales without fuel ebitda without fuel strategic plan and operating costs as a percentage of sales objectives established by the committee the first three metrics will be weighted at each and the final metric will be weighted at the underlying strategy metrics have been revised from prior years to focus on shorter term measures as the long term bonus emphasizes long term performance the plan also provides for an additional payout if our goals for supermarket fuel ebitda supermarket fuel gallons sold and targeted number of fuel centers in operation at the fiscal year end are achieved long term incentives the committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the named executive officers to achieve the long term goals established by the board of directors by conditioning a significant portion of compensation on the achievement of those goals in the committee adopted the first in a series of long term performance based compensation plans designed to reward participants for their contribution to the long term performance of kroger these earlier plans provided for overlapping four year performance periods that allowed for the earning of a long term cash bonus in krogers long term incentive program was redesigned to combine the total value of our long term cash bonus and equity programs into a cohesive strategic reward for eligible executives at the vice president level and above approximately fifty percent of the plan value is performance based delivered in cash and performance units contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance measures the other fifty percent of the value is time based and delivered in stock options and restricted shares each component is described in more detail below performance based long term compensation the long term incentive plan adopted in and earned in provides the model for our combined plan structure subsequent plans have been adopted each year thereafter each of these plans has the following characteristics performance is measured over a three year period between and executives including the named executive officers participate in each plan awards include both cash and performance units the cash bonus base equals the executives salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan adoption date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date as of the date of commencing participation in the plan a fixed number of performance units is awarded to each participant the awards are paid out in kroger common shares along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares compensation under the plans is earned based on our performance against metrics established by the committee at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the bonus base and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the cash bonus base or of the number of performance units awarded in no event can a cash bonus award exceed the following table summarizes each of the long term performance based plans for the years shown plan plan plan plan performance period to to to to payout date march march march

the dividends paid on that number of common shares during the three year performance period payout for the cash components of the plan are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation and all other compensation columns of the summary compensation table and footnotes and to that table and the common shares issued under the plan are reported in the options exercised and stock vested table and footnote to that table equity awards awards based on krogers common shares are granted periodically to the named executive officers and a large number of other employees equity participation aligns the interests of employees with your interest as shareholders and kroger historically has distributed equity awards widely in kroger granted stock options to approximately employees including the named executive officers the options permit the holder to purchase kroger common shares at an option price equal to the closing price of kroger common shares on the date of the grant options are granted only on one of the four dates of compensation committee meetings conducted after krogers public release of its quarterly earnings results krogers long term incentive plans also provide for other equity based awards including restricted stock and performance units during kroger awarded shares of restricted stock to approximately employees including the named executive officers and performance units to approximately employees performance units provide for the issuance of kroger common shares to participants after the completion of the three year performance period based on the extent to which the performance goals established at the beginning of the performance period have been achieved the committee considers several factors in determining the amount of options restricted shares and performance units awarded to the named executive officers or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding equity based and other long term compensation awarded by our competitors the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of equity based awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all named executive officers other than the ceo the committee has long recognized that the amount of compensation provided to the named executive officers through equity based pay is often below the amount paid by our competitors lower equity based awards for the named executive officers and other senior management permit a broader base of kroger employees to participate in equity awards amounts of equity awards issued and outstanding for the named executive officers are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis retirement and other benefits kroger maintains a defined benefit and several defined contribution retirement plans for its employees the named executive officers participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding retirement benefits available to the named executive officers can be found in the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative description that follows this discussion and analysis kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the named executive officers participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year compensation deferred bears interest until paid out at the rate representing krogers cost of ten year debt in the year the rate is set as determined by krogers ceo and reviewed with the committee prior to the beginning of each deferral year in that rate was deferred amounts are paid out only in cash in accordance with a deferral option selected by the participant at the time the deferral election is made we adopted the kroger co employee protection plan or kepp during fiscal year that plan was amended and restated in all of our management employees and administrative support personnel whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service are covered kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described in the plan when an employee is actually or constructively terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of kroger as defined in the plan participants are entitled to severance pay of up to months salary and bonus the actual amount is dependent upon pay level and years of service kepp can be amended or terminated by the board at any time prior to a change in control stock option restricted stock and performance unit agreements with participants in krogers long term incentive plans provide that those awards vest with options becoming immediately exercisable restrictions on restricted stock lapsing and common shares equal to of the performance units being awarded upon a change in control as described in the agreements none of the named executive officers is party to an employment agreement perquisites the committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide the named executive officers a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the only perquisites available to our named executive officers were premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance and premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies the life insurance benefit was offered beginning several years ago to replace a split dollar life insurance benefit that was substantially more costly to kroger currently active executives including the named executive officers and retired executives receive this benefit in addition the named executive officers are entitled to the following benefit that does not constitute a perquisite as defined by sec rules personal use of kroger aircraft which officers may lease from kroger and pay the average variable cost of operating the aircraft making officers more available and allowing for a more efficient use of their time the total amount of perquisites furnished to the named executive officers is shown in the summary compensation table and described in more detail in footnote to that table executive compensation recoupment policy if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual bonus or a long term bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the committee then the officer upon demand from the committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment hedging policy after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board adopted a policy regarding hedging pledging and short sales of kroger securities kroger directors and officers are prohibited from engaging directly or indirectly in hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities in addition they are precluded from pledging kroger securities as collateral for a loan except to the extent that shares so pledged are in excess of the number of shares the individual is required to maintain in accordance with krogers share ownership guidelines more particularly described earlier in this compensation discussion and analysis section m of the internal revenue code tax laws place a deductibility limit of on some types of compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers reported in this proxy because they are among the four highest compensated officers covered employees in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of named executive officers compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the covered employees is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria and have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the covered employees will be deductible by kroger krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is material and supports krogers compensation philosophy the committee also will attempt to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by kroger compensation committee report the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management of the company the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this proxy statement based on its review and discussions with management the compensation committee has recommended to the companys board

cover such periods as may be specified by the committee for purposes of the plan performance goals means performance goals established by the committee which may be based on i earnings or earnings per

six months from the date of grant performance units will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant or in the case of a related performance unit the expiration of the related option any

market value of a common share on the date of payment restricted stock the committee may award restricted stock to participants the stock will be subject to forfeiture restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as specified in the agreement the committee has authority to impose other terms and conditions as it may determine in its discretion including making the vesting of awards contingent on the achievement of performance goals during the period that a restricted stock award is subject to restrictions an employee has the right to vote the shares and receive dividends incentive shares the committee may grant incentive shares to participants incentive share awards will consist of common shares issued or to be issued at such times subject to achievement of such performance goals or other goals or without condition and on such other terms and conditions as the committee deems appropriate and specifies in an agreement relating thereto cash bonuses two types of bonuses can be awarded under the cash bonus program an annual bonus award for each fiscal year and a long term bonus award for measurement periods in excess of one year bonus payments are based on krogers performance measured against performance goals established by the committee the committee establishes a bonus potential for each bonus payable under the cash bonus program for each participant based on the participants level within kroger and actual payouts can exceed that amount when krogers performance exceeds the pre established thresholds initially the performance goals for annual bonuses will include the following components i ebitda ii identical sales iii achievement of strategic initiatives and iv achievement of supermarket fuel center goals for ebitda gallons sold and number of fuel centers initially the performance goals for long term bonuses will include the following components i performance in four key categories in krogers strategic plan ii reduction in

certain federal income tax consequences nonstatutory stock options stock appreciation rights and performance units a grantee will not recognize income on the grant of a nonstatutory stock option stock appreciation right or performance unit but generally will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise thereof the amount of income recognized upon the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option generally will be measured by the excess if any of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price provided the shares issued are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture the amount of income recognized upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or a performance unit in general will be equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any shares received at the time of exercise provided the shares issued are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture plus the amount of any taxes withheld under certain circumstances income on the exercise of a performance unit will be deferred if the grantee makes a proper election to defer such income in some cases the recognition of income by a grantee from the exercise of a performance unit may be delayed for up to six months if a sale of the shares would subject the grantee to suit under section b of the exchange act unless the grantee elects to recognize income at the time of receipt of such shares in either case the amount of income recognized is measured with respect to the fair market value of the common stock at the time the income is recognized in the case of ordinary income recognized by a grantee as described above in connection with the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option a stock appreciation right or a performance unit kroger will be entitled to a deduction in the amount of ordinary income so recognized by the grantee kroger will report the income to be recognized by grantee and will withhold the appropriate taxes incentive shares and restricted stock a grantee of incentive shares or restricted stock is not required to include the value of such shares in ordinary income until the first time the grantees rights in the shares are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture whichever occurs earlier unless the grantee elects to be taxed on receipt of the shares in either case the amount of such income will be equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time the income is recognized over the amount paid for the stock kroger will be entitled to a deduction in the amount of the ordinary income recognized by the grantee for krogers taxable year which includes the last day of the grantees taxable year in which such grantee recognizes the income kroger will report the income to be recognized by grantee and will withhold the appropriate taxes general the rules governing the tax treatment of options stock appreciation rights performance units incentive shares and restricted stock and stock acquired upon the exercise of options stock appreciation rights and performance units are quite technical so that the above description of tax consequences is necessarily general in nature and does not purport to be complete moreover statutory provisions are of course subject to change as are their interpretations and their application may vary in individual circumstances finally the tax consequences under applicable state law may not be the same as under the federal income tax laws tax deductibility cap section m of the code provides that certain compensation received in any year by a covered employee in excess of is non deductible by kroger for federal income tax purposes section m provides an exception however for performance based compensation to the extent practicable under the circumstances the committee currently intends to structure grants and awards made under the plan to covered employees as performance based compensation that is exempt from section m this summary of the long term incentive and cash bonus plan is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the plan that is set forth in appendix of this proxy statement existing plans as of our fiscal year ended february there were shares remaining for future issuance under existing equity compensation plans of these shares were available for awards other than options or stock appreciation rights under some of these plans this sublimit on full value shares can be increased by decreasing by four the total number of shares issuable under the plan for each such increased share the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal new plan benefits long term incentive and cash bonus plan name and position dollar value number of units all groups awards under the long term incentive and cash bonus plan are subject to the discretion of the compensation committee or a committee of officers as applicable it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by executive officers and other employees if the plan is approved by shareholders please refer to the grants of plan based awards table for disclosure of equity awards made to our named executive officers in fiscal equity compensation plan information the following table provides information regarding shares outstanding and available for issuance under the companys existing equity compensation plans a c number of number of securities securities b remaining for future to be issued weighted average issuance under equity upon exercise of exercise price of compensation plans outstanding options outstanding excluding securities warrants and rights options warrants reflected in column plan category and rights a equity compensation plans approved by security holders equity compensation plans not approved by security holders total the total number of securities reported includes the maximum number of common shares that may be issued under performance units granted under one or more long term incentive plans the nature of the awards is more particularly described in the equity section of the compensation discussion and analysis the weighted average exercise price in column b does not take these performance unit awards into account based on historical data or in the case of the award made in and earned in the actual payout percentage the companys best estimate of the number of securities that will be issued under the performance unit agreements is approximately the plans include initial limitations on the number of shares that can be issued as incentive shares or restricted stock the company may increase this amount by decreasing the total number of securities that can be issued by four for each stock share issued in excess of the stated initial limitation advisory vote on executive compensation item no the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in july requires that we give our shareholders the right to approve on a nonbinding advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed earlier in this proxy statement in accordance with the secs rules as discussed earlier in our compensation discussion and analysis our compensation philosophy is to make total compensation competitive include opportunities for equity ownership as part of compensation and use incentive compensation to help drive performance by providing superior pay for superior results furthermore as previously disclosed an increased percentage of total potential compensation is performance based as opposed to time based as half of the compensation previously awarded to the named executive officers as restricted stock and earned based on the passage of time is now only earned to the extent that performance goals are achieved in addition annual and long term cash bonuses are performance based and earned only to the extent that performance goals are achieved in addition annual and long term cash bonuses are performance based and earned only to the extent that performance goals are achieved in tying a large portion of executive compensation to achievement of short term and long term strategic and operational goals we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders the vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation rather the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement the vote is advisory this means that the vote is not binding on kroger the compensation committee of our board of directors is responsible for establishing executive compensation in so doing that committee will consider along with all other relevant factors the results of this vote we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution resolved that the compensation paid to the companys named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to item of regulation s k including the compensation discussion and analysis compensation tables and the related narrative discussion is hereby approved the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal selection of auditors item no the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for the appointment compensation and retention of krogers independent auditor as required by law and by applicable nyse rules on march the audit committee appointed pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor for the fiscal year ending january while shareholder ratification of the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor is not required by krogers regulations or otherwise the board of directors is submitting the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp to shareholders for ratification as it has in past years as a good corporate governance practice if the shareholders fail to ratify the selection the audit committee may but is not required to reconsider whether to retain that firm even if the selection is ratified the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders a representative of pricewaterhousecoopers llp is expected to be present at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal disclosure of auditor fees the following describes the fees billed to kroger by pricewaterhousecoopers llp related to the fiscal years ended february and february fiscal year fiscal year audit fees audit related fees tax fees all other fees total audit fees for the years ended february and february respectively were for professional services rendered for the audits of krogers consolidated financial statements the issuance of comfort letters to underwriters consents and assistance with the review of documents filed with the sec audit related fees audit related services for the year ended february were for assurance and related services pertaining to accounting consultation in connection with attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards these services are considered approved under the companys existing audit and non audit service pre approval policy these fees also included services related to acquisition related due diligence which were approved by the audit committee in june tax fees for the year ended february were for tax audit support and debt restructuring we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for any tax services for the year ended february all other fees we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for other services for the years ended february and february the audit committee requires that it approve in advance all audit and non audit work performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp on march the audit committee approved services to be performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp for the remainder of fiscal year that are related to the audit of kroger or involve the audit itself in the audit committee adopted an audit and non audit service pre approval policy pursuant to the terms of that policy the committee will annually pre approve certain defined services that are expected to be provided by the independent auditors if it becomes appropriate during the year to engage the independent accountant for additional services the audit committee must first approve the specific services before the independent accountant may perform the additional work pricewaterhousecoopers llp has advised the audit committee that neither the firm nor any member of the firm has any financial interest direct or indirect in any capacity in kroger or its subsidiaries shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by five shareholders the names and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at krogers executive offices that they intend to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the kroger companyhuman rights risk assessment resolved that shareholders of the kroger company kroger urge the board of directors to report to shareholders at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information on krogers process for identifying and analyzing potential and actual human rights risks of krogers operations and supply chain referred to herein as a human rights risk assessment addressing the following human rights principles used to frame the assessment frequency of assessment methodology used to track and measure performance nature and extent of consultation with relevant stakeholders in connection with the assessment how the results of the assessment are incorporated into company policies and decision making the report should be made available to shareholders on krogers website no later than october supporting statement as long term shareholders we favor policies and practices that protect and enhance the value of our investments there is increasing recognition that company risks related to human rights violations such as litigation reputational damage and project delays and disruptions can adversely affect shareholder value kroger like many other companies has adopted a supplier code of conduct see the kroger company standard vendor agreement but has yet to publish a company wide human rights policy addressing human rights issues and a separate human rights code that applies to its suppliers adoption of these principles would be an important first step in effectively managing human rights risks companies must then assess risks to shareholder value of human rights practices in their operations and supply chains to translate principles into protective practices the importance of human rights risk assessment is reflected in the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights the ruggie principles approved by the un human rights council in the ruggie principles urge that business enterprises should carry out human rights due diligenceaccessing actual and potential human rights impacts integrating and acting upon the findings tracking responses and communicating how impacts are addressed http www business humanrights org media documents ruggie ruggie guiding principles mar l pd d krogers business exposes it to significant human rights risks as of year end kroger operations including supermarkets convenience and jewelry stores are located in over states with suppliers in countries around the world including iran china and malaysia the companys supply chain is complex and global the company acknowledges that work stoppages supply chain interruptions and civil unrest the kroger company form k feb pages could adversely affect the companys ability to execute its strategic plan we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the importance of ensuring basic human rights are recognized by those seeking to do business with us as such kroger has in place a comprehensive code of conduct that is applicable to those that furnish goods or services to us as well as their contractors that code of conduct has been published and is available on our website at www kroger com our existing code of conduct requires compliance with all applicable labor laws regulations and orders including the fair labor standards act in addition the code of conduct prohibits child indentured involuntary or prison labor prohibits exposing workers to unreasonably hazardous unsafe or unhealthy conditions prohibits unlawful discrimination requires the workplace to be free from harassment requires workers to be treated fairly with dignity and respect requires that wages meet or exceed legal and industry standards requires that u s workers be eligible for employment in the u s prohibits bribes and conduct that appears improper or may result in a conflict of interest requires compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act and requires maintenance of records that must be furnished to us upon request evidencing compliance with the code krogers code of conduct does more than simply reporting on human rights risks in its supply chain it prohibits those that do business with us from engaging in the type of conduct of concern to the proponents those that violate our code will not be permitted to do business with us until they comply with our code as such we do not believe that human rights violations in our supply chain pose a substantial risk that the requested report would serve little benefit to shareholders and preparation of a report would divert resources that otherwise could be more appropriately used in the best interests of shareholders this proposal covers the same subject matter as one submitted to a vote at the last three years annual meetings and was soundly defeated by shareholders shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by two shareholders the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at krogers executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas post consumer packaging and printed paper comprises nearly half of u s landfill waste and is a significant consumer of natural resources energy and source of greenhouse gas emissions half of printed paper and packaging is landfilled or burned rather than recycled plastic packaging debris migrates to oceans where it damages fisheries tourism and marine life there is a growing link between ineffective waste management and plastic debris piling up in earths oceans and waterways where it injures and kills marine animals transports invasive species and poses a threat to human health california spends nearly million annually to prevent trash much of it packaging from polluting beaches rivers and ocean frontage the estimated market value of wasted packaging that could be recycled is billion increased recycling provides more efficient use of valuable resources it generates less pollution and requires less energy than using virgin raw materials in the u s taxpayers pay to recycle packaging but poor infrastructure and strapped municipal budgets have yielded lagging recycling rates for aluminum for glass and only for plastic further krogers house brands among other products are recently increasing use of non recyclable flexible plastic packaging such as pouches more than countries have shifted some or all costs of packaging recycling onto producers u s producers of packaging intensive brands can expect to be asked to take more responsibility for recycling of packaging in the future we believe some measure of responsibility for packaging is a key component of a corporate environmental sustainability policy extended producer responsibility epr a corporate and public policy that shifts accountability for financing recycling of materials from taxpayers to producers is a promising potential solution two major brands coca cola co and nestle waters na have called for producers to adopt epr programs in the u s legislation is pending in several states taking an active role in planning for mandated producer responsibility for packaging will reduce risk ensure continued high quality packaging reduce wasted resources and increase program efficiencies the company has not moved decisively to lead or participate in such an effort nor addressed its responsibility for post consumer packaging for its brands be it resolved that shareowners of kroger request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost and omitting confidential information developing a policy position on the companys responsibility for post consumer product packaging recycling of its private label brands and assessing whether alternative approaches could lead to substantially increased packaging recycling supporting statement options reviewed in the report should include analyses of company based actions that will increase recyclability of packaging materials and participation in policy and technical development of epr or other producer responsibility strategies in collaboration with sector peers policymakers and suppliers with a goal of greatly increased u s recycling rates and reduced energy use and pollution the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding waste reduction and recognizes the important role it plays as a good steward of the environment we have numerous sustainability initiatives in place to preserve our natural resources and to conserve energy for instance the company recycled more than million pounds of plastic waste from bags and plastic film in the company also recycles more than a billion pounds of cardboard each year most importantly weve pioneered the perishable donations partnership which enables the donation of more than million pounds of safe wholesome food to feeding america food banks to fight hunger in local communities that which cannot be donated is composted or converted to energy through an innovative waste to energy system by scaling up these innovative solutions kroger is reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfills kroger also works to reduce waste in the first place by designing optimized packaging and is participating in national efforts to expand and scale infrastructure for each of the past several years we have published on line the kroger co public responsibilities report and our annual sustainability report that highlight the companys sustainability initiatives and waste reduction efforts in greater detail this proposal requests that kroger take additional steps to report on the feasibility of adopting a policy of extended producer responsibility or epr the resolution provides no guidance regarding proponents view of the requirements of a company adopted epr policy kroger supports efforts to reduce waste in the supply chain as described above and in our various sustainability reports it would be inappropriate however to support a policy that is not clearly defined we believe our support for waste reduction efforts in our supply chain are significant and meaningful kroger is familiar with various epr proposals in states and laws in other countries that require retailers and manufacturers to pay substantial taxes and fees related to waste disposal the proposals vary in detail and implementation and while we do assess new laws and regulations for their feasibility cost and requirements to do so for each individual epr proposal at the federal state and international level would require significant resources that could be allocated more wisely in the best interests of shareholders kroger often is asked to take a position on legislation or regulatory proposals while occasionally we will communicate to federal state and local officials our positions on specific policy issues we believe it is premature to offer an official position statement on epr legislative and regulatory proposals without first carefully examining the specifics of each individual law or regulation and how it would affect our customers and our business this proposal covers the same subject matter as one submitted to a vote at the last two years annual meetings and was soundly defeated by shareholders shareholder proposals annual meeting shareholder proposals intended for inclusion in our proxy material relating to krogers annual meeting in june should be addressed to the secretary of kroger and must be received at our executive offices not later than january these proposals must comply with rule a and the secs proxy rules the companys regulations contain an advance notice of shareholder business and nominations requirement which generally prescribes the procedures that a shareholder of the company must follow if the shareholder intends at an annual meeting to nominate a person for election to the companys board of directors or to propose other business to be considered by shareholders these procedures include among other things that the shareholder give timely notice to the secretary of the company of

competitive environment a managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations our business the kroger co was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nations largest retailers as measured by revenue operating supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons food less fred meyer frys harris teeter jay c king soopers qfc ralphs and smiths of these stores have fuel centers we also operate convenience stores either directly or through franchisees and fine jewelry stores kroger operates manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over of krogers consolidated sales and ebitda are our only reportable segment on january we closed our merger with harris teeter supermarkets inc harris teeter by purchasing of the harris teeter outstanding common stock for approximately billion the merger allows us to expand into the fast growing southeastern and mid atlantic markets and into washington d c harris teeter is included in our ending consolidated balance sheet but because of the timing of the merger closing late in the year its results of operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations for see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our merger with harris teeter our performance we achieved outstanding results in our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count and good cost control as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share our net earnings were billion or per diluted share compared to billion or per diluted share for the same period of the net earnings for include a net benefit of million which includes benefits from certain tax items of million offset partially by after tax expense of million million in interest and million in operating general and administrative expenses in costs related to our merger with harris teeter adjusted items see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to the benefits from certain tax items for our net earnings include an estimated after tax amount of million or per diluted share due to a rd week in fiscal year the extra week in addition net earnings benefited by million after tax or per diluted share from a settlement with visa and mastercard and from a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january excluding the adjusted items net earnings for totaled billion or per diluted share compared to net earnings in of billion or per diluted share excluding the visa and mastercard settlement the ufcw consolidated pension fund adjustment and the extra week in we believe adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share present a more accurate year over year comparison of our financial results because the adjusted items were not directly related to our day to day business after accounting for these and adjusted items our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for represents a increase compared to please refer to the net earnings section for more information our identical supermarket sales increased excluding fuel in compared to we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as it is a key performance target for our long term growth strategy a increasing market share is an important part of our long term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen pos data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately basis points in across our marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in of the marketing areas and declined in two wal mart supercenters are one of our top two competitors in of these marketing areas in these marketing areas our market share increased in and slightly declined in one these market share results reflect our long term strategy of market share growth results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods and an extra week in net earnings net earnings totaled billion in billion in and million in the net earnings for include a net benefit of million after tax related to the adjusted

totaled and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in totaled which excludes the adjusted item adjusted net earnings per diluted share in compared to adjusted net earnings per diluted share in

repurchase of kroger common shares increased fifo non fuel operating profit increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a decrease in the lifo charge to million pre tax compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because the adjusted items referenced above in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are not directly related to our day to day business adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of ongoing operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our day to day operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets in addition management takes into account adjusted net earnings when calculating management incentive programs a the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to the kroger co to net earnings attributable to the kroger co excluding the adjusted items and a

expansion or relocation for five full quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between

purchases of kroger common shares totaling million in billion in and billion in under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately

quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts harris a teeters invested capital has been excluded from the calculation in due to the timing of the merger and the immaterial effect on operations as compared to the average invested capital roic is a non gaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures excluding certain adjustments to operating income although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to

critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both workers compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability claims are not discounted the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in million in and million in we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense a the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of february we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value in goodwill increased million due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january for additional information related to the allocation of the harris teeter purchase price refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and see note to the consolidated financial statements the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings if any in merchandise costs we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred a post retirement benefit plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end and was to match the plans cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plans projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of and as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february by approximately to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories due to the harris teeter merger occurring close to year end the expected rate of return on pension plan assets acquired in the harris teeter merger did not affect our net periodic benefit cost in for and we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of our pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans excluding pension plan assets acquired in the harris teeter merger during the calendar year ending december net of investment management fees and expenses increased for the past years our average annual rate of return has been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an rate of return assumption was reasonable for and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of krogers pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions projected benefit percentage obligation expense point change decrease increase decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets a we contributed million in million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans we do not expect to make any contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions we contributed and expensed million in million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts the k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service multi employer pension plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans in the fourth quarter of we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with locals of the ufcw that participated in four multi employer pension funds the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multi employer pension funds into one multi employer pension fund under the terms of the mou the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through we are designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated pension plan with sole investment authority over the assets we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the pre consolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability uaal that existed as of december in a series of installments on or before march at january the uaal was estimated to be million pre tax in accordance with gaap we expensed million in related to the uaal the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment in we finalized the uaal contractual commitment and recorded an adjustment that reduced our estimated commitment by million pre tax the final uaal contractual commitment at january was million pre tax in the fourth quarter of we contributed million to the consolidated multi employer pension plan of which million was allocated to the uaal and million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in in the fourth quarter of we contributed million to the consolidated multi employer pension plan to fully fund our uaal contractual commitment future contributions will be dependent among other things on the investment performance of assets in the plan the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of million in million in and million in the cash contributions for and include our million contribution in and our million contribution in to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of each year based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets i e the amount of underfunding as of december because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing krogers share of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above as of december we estimate that krogers share of the a underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion pre tax or billion after tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately million pre tax or million after tax as of december compared to december the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the increased returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans during our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on current market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and krogers future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand krogers share of the underfunding could increase and krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation the company continues to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any commitments to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi employer pension plans deferred rent we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets uncertain tax positions we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of a february the internal revenue service had concluded its field examination of our and federal tax returns we have filed an administrative appeal with the internal revenue service protesting certain adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service as a result of their field work the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately of inventories in and of inventories in were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by billion at february and by billion at february we follow the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately billion in and and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns recently adopted accounting standards in february the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income in which the item was reclassified if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it requires cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period this new disclosure became effective for us beginning february and is being adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard see note to the companys consolidated financial statements for the companys new disclosures related to this amended standard a in december the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement this information is intended to enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on our financial position the new rules became effective for us on february in january the fasb further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements securities borrowings and lending transactions see note to the companys consolidated financial statements for the companys new disclosures related to this amended standard recently issued accounting standards in july the fasb amended accounting standards codification asc income taxes the amendments provide guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either a reduction of a deferred tax asset or as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists the amendments will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december and may be applied on a retrospective basis early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations liquidity and capital

includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately billion of commercial paper and million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the companys share repurchase programs we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities during but do not currently expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper cp program at february we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march we had million of cp borrowings outstanding the decrease as of march compared to year end was due to applying cash from operations against our year end cp outstanding borrowings our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was to as of february if this ratio were to exceed to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of february if this ratio fell below to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end a the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of february in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans which totaled million in the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined as of february we had billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability related to workers compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our purchase obligations include commitments many of which are short term in nature to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of february we maintained a billion with the ability to increase by million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on january outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintain two uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of february we had billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of february a in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of february we had authorized for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about krogers future performance including harris teeter these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal year in we expect net earnings per diluted share growth of which includes the expected accretion to net earnings from the harris teeter merger thereafter we would expect to return to our long term growth rate we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in fiscal year we expect full year fifo non fuel operating margin for to expand slightly compared to excluding the adjusted items for we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million a for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to improve our current debt coverage ratios to pay cash dividends and to repurchase stock we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations we expect capital investments for to increase to approximately billion excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we also expect capital investments to increase incrementally million each year over the next few years excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to accomplish our strategy we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before mergers acquisitions and operational closings for we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the unexpected effect of the resolution of any tax issues and benefits from certain tax items we do not anticipate goodwill impairments in for we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension funds we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any commitments to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in cincinnati atlanta southern california new mexico richmond hampton roads west virginia and arizona and an agreement with the teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities these negotiations will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for good wages and affordable health care also we must address the underfunding of multi employer pension plans various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares pay dividends and fund capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases the effect of brand prescription drugs going off patent our ability to retain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter the a extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including inflation or deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above during the first three quarters of our fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our lifo charge for the fiscal year will be affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of participants changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on krogers business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking

the companys fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest january the last three fiscal years consist of the week periods ended february and january and the week period ended february pervasiveness of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of consolidated revenues and expenses during the reporting period also is required actual results could differ from those estimates inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a last in first out lifo basis or market in total approximately and of inventories for and respectively were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the first in first out fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by at february and at february the company follows the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating its lifo charge or credit the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at the companys supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of the companys inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date a notes to consolidated financial statements continued property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of assets acquired in a business combination at fair value depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets buildings and land improvements are depreciated based on lives varying from to years all new purchases of store equipment are assigned lives varying from three to nine years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term to which they relate which varies from four to years or the useful life of the asset manufacturing plant and distribution center equipment is depreciated over lives varying from three to years information technology assets are generally depreciated over five years depreciation expense was in in and in interest costs on significant projects constructed for the companys own use are capitalized as part of the costs of the newly constructed facilities upon retirement or disposal of assets the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in net earnings deferred rent the company recognizes rent holidays including the time period during which the company has access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the companys consolidated balance sheets goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the company performs reviews of each of its operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if the company identifies impairment for long lived assets to be held and used the company compares the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows the company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for sale the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal the company recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling and in and respectively costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets for each of the years presented have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense a notes to consolidated financial statements continued store closing costs the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income the company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the companys policy on impairment of long lived assets inventory write downs if any in connection with store closings are classified in merchandise costs costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred the following table summarizes accrual activity for future lease obligations of stores that were closed in the normal course of business and assumed in the merger with harris teeter supermarkets inc harris teeter future lease obligations balance at january additions payments other balance at february additions payments other assumed from harris teeter balance at

protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its derivative instruments are described in note commodity price protection the company enters into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in its manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in its stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices the company enters into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of the normal course of business the companys current program relative to commodity price protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its purchase commitments are described in note a notes to consolidated financial statements continued benefit plans and multi employer pension plans the company recognizes the funded status of its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci all plans are measured as of the companys fiscal year end the determination of the obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company also participates in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded refer to note for additional information regarding the companys participation in these various multi employer plans and the united food and commercial workers

rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition the company records expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the awards lapse deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting basis refer to note for the types of differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as a net current or noncurrent asset or liability based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes a deferred tax asset or liability that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is classified according to the expected reversal date uncertain tax positions the company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in its consolidated financial statements refer to note for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit the companys income tax returns these audits include questions regarding the companys tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes the company records allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of february the internal revenue service had concluded its field examination of a notes to consolidated financial statements continued the companys and federal tax returns the company has filed an administrative appeal with the internal revenue service protesting certain adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service as a result of their field work the assessment of the companys tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the companys various filing positions self insurance costs the company is primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis the company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits the following table summarizes the changes in the companys self insurance liability through february beginning balance expense claim payments assumed from harris teeter ending balance less current portion long term portion the current portion of the self insured liability is included in other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the company maintains surety bonds related to self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which the company is self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event the company is unable to meet its claim payment obligations up to its self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of the company as the company has recorded reserves for the claim costs the company is similarly self insured for property related losses the company maintains stop loss coverage to limit its property loss exposures including coverage for earthquake wind flood and other catastrophic events revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale discounts provided to customers by the company at the time of sale including those provided in connection with loyalty cards are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold discounts provided by vendors usually in the form of paper coupons are not recognized as a reduction in sales provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons the company records a receivable from the vendor for the difference in sales price and cash received pharmacy sales are recorded when provided to the customer sales taxes are recorded as other accrued liabilities and not as a component of sales the company does not recognize a sale when it sells its own gift cards and gift certificates rather it records a deferred liability equal to the amount received a sale is then recognized when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed to purchase the companys products gift card and certificate breakage is recognized when redemption is deemed remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card the amount of breakage has not been material for and a notes to consolidated financial statements continued merchandise costs the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations includes product costs net of discounts and allowances advertising costs see separate discussion below inbound freight charges warehousing costs including receiving and inspection costs transportation costs and manufacturing production and operational costs warehousing transportation and manufacturing management salaries are also included in the merchandise costs line item however purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the operating general and administrative line item along with most of the companys other managerial and administrative costs rent expense and depreciation expense are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the companys approach is to include in the merchandise costs line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold advertising costs the companys advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations the companys pre tax advertising costs totaled in in and in the company does not record vendor allowances for co operative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense cash temporary

and convenience stores throughout the united states the companys retail operations which represent over of the companys consolidated sales and ebitda are its only reportable segment the companys retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long term financial performance in addition the companys operating divisions offer to its customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of the companys merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location the companys operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how the companys chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as the

atlantic markets and into washington d c the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was financed through a combination of commercial paper and long term debt see note in a business combination the purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values with any excess of purchase price over fair value recognized as goodwill in addition to recognizing the assets and liabilities on the acquired companys balance sheet the company reviews supply contracts leases financial instruments employment agreements and other significant agreements to identify potential assets or liabilities that require recognition in connection with the application of acquisition accounting under asc intangible assets are recognized apart from

synergies expected from the merger as well as any intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition the transaction was treated as a stock purchase for income tax purposes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the merger did not result in a step up of the tax basis and goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes the above amounts represent the preliminary allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision when the resulting valuations of property and intangible assets are finalized which will occur prior to january due to the

with complex medical conditions resulting in combined additional goodwill of testing for impairment must be performed annually or on an interim basis upon the occurrence of a triggering event or a change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows the company believes goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a reduction in fair value of the companys reporting

federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the rate for state income taxes is lower than and due to an increase in state credits including the benefit from filing amended returns to claim additional credits the benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction increased from due to additional deductions taken in as well as the amendment of prior years tax returns to claim the additional benefit available in years still under review by the internal revenue service the effective tax rate was significantly lower than and due to the effect on pre tax income of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge of after tax in the effect of the ufcw

be realized based on all available evidence this evidence includes historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the companys tax methods of accounting unless deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset until such time that realization becomes more likely than not increases and decreases in these valuation allowances are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits including positions impacting only the

adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated the company also contributes to various other multi employer benefit
