change in your determination of the codm we also note there is no longer a named executive officer with the title of chief operating officer but there is now a new named executive officer title called executive vice president evp of retail operations please describe and compare and contrast the historical role of the chief operating officer and the current role of the evp of retail operations kroger response in our form k for the fiscal year ended january we identified our ceo as the codm due to the retirement of our president and chief operating officer coo on june following the retirement the combined role of president and coo was not continued which resulted in our ceo having sole responsibility for all functions across the company which includes allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our retail operations the former president and coo had significant responsibilities associated with allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our retail operations which included decision making authority over the retail operations merchandising procurement marketing manufacturing corporate brands supply chain and risk management functions the evp of retail operations is responsible for day to day supermarket retail operations the responsibility for day to day supermarket retail operations does not include responsibility for allocating resources to our operating divisions or decision making authority over certain functions integral to our business operations such as merchandising real estate procurement supply chain capital allocation marketing manufacturing and risk management please tell us the role of the codm or ceo in this case and tell us the title and describe the role of each of the individuals who report to the codm if the evp of retail operations does not report to the codm tell us the title and role of the person the evp of retail operations reports to in the organization also identify and describe the role of each of

procurement marketing manufacturing corporate brands and supply chain timothy a massa gvp human resources responsible for human resources talent development and labor relations aside from the evps the ceos direct reports are primarily responsible for strategic and administrative functions and not our retail operations we do not consider any of the evps to be a codm due to the compartmentalization of their operational responsibilities which requires the evps to defer to our ceo for ultimate decision making authority previously many of the evps duties were consolidated under our president and coos role which created a higher level of decision making authority for that role and ultimately resulted in the company designating both the coo and ceo as codms we employ operating division managers which are each titled division president these divisions are allocated resources by our codm and the division presidents are responsible for the following duties within their operating division lead and direct the division to exceed customer expectations for ease of shopping service variety freshness cleanliness food safety and regulatory conditions providing strategic leadership by establishing

you have complied with the guidance in item e i a and b of regulation s k with respect to your disclosure of fifo gross margin and how you have complied with the guidance in item e i a with respect to your disclosure of non gaap return on invested capital this comment also applies to your form q filed june kroger response fifo gross margin after consideration of how we disclosed fifo gross margin in our form k filed june as contemplated by item e i a and b of regulation s k in future form k filings our disclosures will only state gaap gross margin or initially state the gaap gross margin prior to the fifo gross margin in future k filings we will also include a reference to the consolidated statements of operations where the definition of fifo gross margin is provided and the lifo charge is separately disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated statements of operations such that the reconciliation of fifo gross margin to gaap gross margin is readily determinable by the reader our form q filed june initially discusses gaap gross margin then defines fifo gross margin as gaap gross margin less the lifo charge and explains our rationale that fifo gross margin is a useful metric for management investors and analysts we believe this disclosure as contemplated in light of item e i a and b of regulation s k satisfies the prominence requirements and makes reconciliation of the gaap and non gaap metrics readily determinable by the reader return on invested capital roic after consideration of how we disclosed roic in our form k filed june as contemplated by item e i a and b of regulation s k in future form k filings our disclosures of roic within the earnings release text will be accompanied by a specific reference to the accompanying roic calculation table roic is not a measure of financial performance under gaap we believe a reference to our tabular calculation which includes the reconciliation of both the most directly comparable gaap numerator and denominator to the non gaap numerator and denominator is a clear presentation which a reader could use to readily determine a return metric based on gaap measures our form q filed june shows the roic calculation in a singular section which includes a tabular calculation of both the most directly comparable gaap numerator and denominator to the non gaap numerator and denominator which we believe is a clear presentation a reader could use to readily determine a return metric based on gaap measures we acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing
