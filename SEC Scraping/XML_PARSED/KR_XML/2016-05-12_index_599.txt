committees of the board are available on our website at ir kroger com under corporate governance highlights shareholders may obtain a copy of the guidelines by making a written request to krogers secretary at our executive offices independence the board has determined that all of the non employee directors have no material relationships with kroger and therefore are independent for purposes of the new york stock exchange listing standards the board made its determination based on information furnished by all members regarding their relationships with kroger and its management and other relevant information after reviewing the information the board determined that all of the non employee directors were independent because they all satisfied the criteria for independence set forth in rule a of the nyse listed company manual the value of any business transactions between kroger and entities with which the directors are affiliated falls below the thresholds identified by the nyse listing standards and none had any material relationships with kroger except for those arising directly from their performance of services as a director for kroger in determining that mr sargent is independent the board considered transactions during fiscal between kroger and staples inc where mr sargent is chairman and ceo and determined that the amount of business fell below the thresholds set by the nyse listing standards the transactions involved the purchase of goods by kroger in the ordinary course of business totaling approximately million and represented less than of staples annual consolidated gross revenue kroger periodically employs a bidding process or negotiations following a benchmarking of costs of products from various vendors for the items purchased from staples and awards the business based on the results of that process audit committee expertise the board has determined that anne gates susan m phillips and ronald l sargent independent directors who are members of the audit committee are audit committee financial experts as defined by applicable sec regulations and that all members of the audit committee are financially literate as that term is used in the nyse listing standards and are independent in accordance with rule a of the securities exchange act of code of ethics the board has adopted the kroger co policy on business ethics applicable to all officers employees and directors including krogers principal executive financial and accounting officers the policy is available on our website at ir kroger com under corporate governance highlights shareholders may also obtain a copy of the policy by making a written request to krogers secretary at our executive offices communications with the board the board has established two separate mechanisms for shareholders and interested parties to communicate with the board any shareholder or interested party who has concerns regarding accounting improper use of kroger assets or ethical improprieties may report these concerns via the toll free hotline or email address helpline kroger com established by the boards audit committee the concerns are investigated by krogers vice president

krogers secretary at our executive offices communications relating to personnel issues or our ordinary business operations or seeking to do business with us will be forwarded to the business unit of kroger that the secretary deems appropriate all other communications will be forwarded to the chair of the corporate governance committee for further consideration the chair of the corporate governance committee will take such action as he or she deems appropriate which may include referral to the full corporate governance committee or the entire board attendance the board held five meetings in fiscal year during fiscal year all incumbent directors attended at least of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and committees on which that director served members of the board are expected to use their best efforts to attend all annual meetings of shareholders all eleven members then serving on the board attended last years annual meeting independent compensation consultants the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the compensation committee in the design of krogers executive compensation in kroger paid that consultant for work performed for the compensation committee kroger on managements recommendation retained the parent and affiliated companies of mercer human resource consulting to provide other services for kroger in for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to insurance claims for which kroger was reimbursed by insurance carriers as claims were adjusted insurance brokerage and bonding commissions provided by marsh usa inc and pension plan compliance and actuary services provided by mercer inc kroger also made payments to affiliated companies for insurance premiums that were collected by the affiliated companies on behalf of insurance carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the compensation committee nor the board expressly approved the other services after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the compensation committee determined that the consultant is independent and his work has not raised any conflict of interest because the consultant was first engaged by the compensation committee before he became associated with mercer the consultant works exclusively for the compensation committee and not for our management the consultant does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services for kroger the compensation committee may engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable compensation committee interlocks and insider participation no member of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of kroger during fiscal and no member of the compensation committee is a former officer of kroger or was a party to any disclosable related person transaction involving kroger during fiscal none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers serving as a member of krogers board of directors or compensation committee of the board board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board is responsible for strategic planning and overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo addresses matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees at the committee level reports are given by management subject matter experts to each committee on risks within the scope of their charters the audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control that exposure the audit committee also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management including our chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective board committees regarding management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by the lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr mcmullen as chairman of the board and ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls compensation discussion and analysis executive summary named executive officers this

compensation for the neos and in the case of the ceos compensation making recommendations to the independent directors additional detail is provided in the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosures that follow this discussion and analysis our compensation philosophy and objectives as one of the largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals krogers incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation the compensation committee believes that there is a strong link between our business strategy the performance metrics in our short term and long term incentive programs and the business results that drive shareholder value we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our focus on our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of executives and shareholders components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the compensation committee has three related objectives regarding compensation first the compensation committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that officers play at kroger second a majority of compensation should help align the interests of our officers with the interests of our shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our neos is comprised of the following annual compensation salary performance based annual cash bonus long term compensation performance based long term incentive plan consisting of a long term cash bonus and performance units non qualified stock options restricted stock retirement and other benefits limited perquisites the annual and long term performance based compensation awards described herein were made pursuant to our long term incentive and cash bonus plan and our long term incentive and cash bonus plan each of which was approved by our shareholders in and respectively annual compensation salary our philosophy with respect to salary is to provide a sufficient and stable source of fixed cash compensation all of our compensation cannot be at risk or long term it is important to provide a meaningful annual salary to attract and retain a high caliber leadership team and to have an appropriate level of cash compensation that is not variable salaries for the neos with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the compensation committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by the independent directors salaries for the neos are reviewed annually in june the amount of each neos salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the compensation committee or in the case of the ceo of the compensation committee and the rest of the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure in role and relationship to other kroger executives salaries the assessment of individual contribution is a qualitative determination based on the following factors leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the amounts shown below reflect the salaries of the neos effective at the end of each fiscal year salary w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael j donnelly christopher t hjelm frederick j morganthall ii mr mcmullen was named ceo of kroger as of january and chairman of the board as of january messrs schlotman donnelly hjelm and morganthall were each promoted to the position of executive vice president effective september messrs hjelm and morganthall became neos in annual compensation performance based annual cash bonus the neos along with approximately of their fellow kroger associates participate in a performance based annual cash bonus plan approximately of those associates are eligible for the same plan as the neos the remaining associates are eligible for an annual cash bonus plan of which is based on the kroger corporate plan and is based on the metrics and targets for their respective supermarket division or operating unit of the company over time the compensation committee and our independent directors have placed an increased emphasis on our strategic plan by making the targets more difficult to achieve the annual cash bonus plan is structured to encourage high levels of performance a threshold level of performance must be achieved before any payouts are earned while a payout of up to of target can be achieved for superior performance the amount of annual cash bonus that the neos earn each year is based upon krogers performance compared to targets established by the compensation committee and the independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors the annual cash bonus plan is designed to encourage decisions and behavior that drive the annual operating results and the long term success of the company krogers success is based on a combination of factors and accordingly the compensation committee believes that it is important to encourage behavior that supports multiple elements of our business strategy establishing annual cash bonus potentials the compensation committee establishes annual cash bonus potentials for each neo other than the ceo whose annual cash bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts which can exceed of the potential amounts but may not exceed of the potential amounts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the goals established by the compensation committee actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the goals established by the compensation committee the compensation committee considers multiple factors in making its determination or recommendation as to annual cash bonus potentials the individuals level within the organization as the compensation committee believes that more senior executives should have a more substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance the individuals salary as the compensation committee believes that a significant portion of a neos total cash compensation should be dependent upon krogers performance the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of annual cash bonus potentials within kroger individual performance the recommendation of the ceo for all neos other than the ceo and the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding annual cash bonus potential and total compensation awarded by our peer group the annual cash bonus potential in effect at the end of the fiscal year for each neo is shown below actual annual cash bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual cash bonus potential w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael j donnelly christopher t hjelm frederick j morganthall ii mr mcmullen was named ceo of kroger as of january and chairman of the board as of january messrs schlotman donnelly hjelm and morganthall were each promoted to the position of executive vice president effective september messrs hjelm and morganthall became neos in annual cash bonus plan metrics and connection to our business plan the annual cash bonus plan has the following measurable performance metrics all of which are interconnected and individually necessary to sustain our business model and achieve our growth strategy metric weight rationale for use id sales id sales represent sales without fuel at our supermarkets that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our sales across the enterprise a key driver of our model is strong id sales it is the engine that fuels our growth ebitda without fuel ebitda is an important way for us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we cannot achieve solid ebitda without a strong operating model this is one of the closest measures we have for how much cash our business generates after operating expenses unlike earnings per share which can be affected by management decisions on share buybacks this measure of earnings is relevant for all of our approximately associates who are eligible for the annual cash bonus plan metric weight rationale for use customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in all of krogers decision making on the customer the four keys of krogers customer st strategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric measures the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys annual cash bonus payout is based on certain elements of the customer st plan to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year total operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way we strive to be disciplined so that as the company grows expenses are properly managed total of metrics fuel bonus kicker an additional is earned if kroger achieves three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations targeted fuel ebitda an increase in total gallons sold and additional fuel centers placed in service the fuel bonus was added to the annual cash bonus plan as an incentive to encourage the addition of fuel centers at a faster rate while maintaining fuel ebitda and fuel gallon growth the fuel bonus of is only available if all three measures are met if any of the three fuel goals are not met no portion of the fuel bonus is earned ebitda is calculated as operating profit plus depreciation and amortization excluding fuel and consolidated variable interest entities total operating costs is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel the use of these four primary metrics creates checks and balances on the various behaviors and decisions that impact the long term success of the company the id sales ebitda without fuel and customer st strategy metrics are weighted equally to highlight the need to simultaneously achieve all three metrics in order to maintain our growth we aligned the weighting of id sales and ebitda without fuel metrics to emphasize sales growth balanced with the focus on profit krogers business is not sustainable if we merely increase our id sales but do not have a corresponding increase in earnings furthermore payouts in the id sales and ebitda without fuel segments are interrelated achieving the goal for both the id sales and ebitda without fuel results in a higher percentage payout on both elements achieving the target on one but not the other will limit the payout percentage on both by supporting the customer st strategy and the four keys we will better connect with our customers our unique competitive advantage is our ability to deliver on the four keys which are the items that matter most to our customers and it is that multi faceted achievement that we believe drives our id sales growth as we strive to achieve our aggressive growth targets we also continuously aim to reduce our operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel productivity improvements and other reductions in operating costs allow us to reduce costs in areas that do not matter to our customers so that we can invest money in the areas that matter the most to our customers like the four keys we carefully manage operating cost reductions to ensure a consistent delivery of the customer experience this again shows the need to have multiple metrics to create checks and balances on the various behavior and decisions that are influenced by the design of the bonus plan results of annual cash bonus plan the goals established by the compensation committee the actual results and the bonus percentage earned for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as follows actual performance goals compared to amount target actual target weight earned performance metrics minimum performance a b a x b id sales ebitda without fuel billion billion billion customer st strategy over over over total operating costs as budget by budget by budget by percentage of sales basis basis basis without fuel points points points fuel bonus as described in the footnote below or total earned actual performance results exclude roundys because the merger occurred after the performance goals were established under the terms of the plan if id sales results exceed the target and ebitda results exceed the target then the payout percentage for reaching the ebitda target is rather than the customer st strategy component also was established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive total operating costs without fuel were budgeted at as a percentage of sales for fiscal year an additional is earned if kroger achieves three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations achievement of the targeted fuel ebitda of million an increase in total gallons sold of and achievement of additional fuel centers placed in service actual results were fuel ebitda of million an increase in total gallons sold of and additional fuel centers placed in service following the close of the year the compensation committee reviewed krogers performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives the compensation committee believes our management produced outstanding results in measured against increasingly aggressive business plan objectives due to our performance when compared to the goals established by the compensation committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board the neos and all other participants in the corporate annual cash bonus plan earned of their bonus potentials in as in all years the compensation committee retained discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus payout for all executive officers including the neos if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate given their assessment of company performance the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus the compensation committee and the independent directors also retained discretion to adjust the goals for each metric under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year no adjustments were made to the goals in the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo determined that the annual cash bonus payouts earned appropriately reflected the companys strong performance in and therefore should not be adjusted the actual annual cash bonus percentage payout for represented excellent performance that exceeded our business plan objectives with the exception of operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of earned amounts under our annual cash bonus plan in previous years such as and when payouts were less than in those years we did not achieve all of our business plan objectives a comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage payouts in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance annual cash bonus fiscal year payout percentage as described above the annual cash bonus payout percentage is applied to each neos bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo the actual amounts of performance based annual cash bonuses paid to the neos for are reported in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the neos to achieve the long term goals established by the board as such a majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the companys long term goals and is delivered via four long term compensation vehicles long term cash bonus performance units stock options and restricted stock long term compensation promotes long term value creation and discourages the over emphasis of attaining short term goals at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee considers several factors in determining the target value of long term compensation awarded to the neos or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding long term compensation awarded by our peer group the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all neos other than the ceo long term incentives are structured to be a combination of performance and time based compensation that reflects elements of financial and stock performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit payouts are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial measures and incentivize recipients to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the companys long term strategic goals stock options and restricted stock are linked to stock performance creating alignment between executives and company shareholders options have no initial value and recipients only realize benefits if the value of our stock increases following the date of grant a majority of long term compensation is equity based performance units stock options and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common shares further aligning the interests of our neos with our shareholders all four components of long term compensation are intended to focus executive behaviors on our long term strategy each component is described in more detail below amounts of long term compensation awards issued and outstanding for the neos are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis long term incentive plan design in contrast to the performance based annual cash bonus plan described above which has approximately participants our performance based long term incentive plan has approximately participants including the neos each year we adopt a similar long term incentive plan which provides for overlapping three year performance periods the long term incentive plan consists of a performance based long term cash bonus and performance units which has the following characteristics the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the participants salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition a fixed number of performance units is awarded to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the earned awards are paid out in kroger common shares based on actual performance along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares ultimately earned the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance units earned are each determined based on our performance against the same metrics established by the compensation committee the independent directors for the ceo at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the baseline of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance units awarded the compensation committee anticipates adopting a new long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year periods each year when establishing the performance metric baselines and percentage payouts per unit of improvement the compensation committee considers the difficulty of achieving compounded improvement over time during kroger awarded performance units to approximately employees including the neos long term incentive plan metrics and connection to our business strategy metric rationale for use customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in all of krogers decision making on the customer the four keys of krogers customer st strategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric measures the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys long term incentive plan payout is based on all of the elements of the customer st strategy to maintain our top executives consistent focus on the entirety of the customer st strategy this is in contrast to the annual cash bonus payout which is based on certain elements of the customer st plan to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year improvement in associateengagement kroger measures associate engagement in an annual survey of associates this metric is included in the long term incentive plan as an acknowledgement that our companys success is directly tied to our associates connecting with and serving our customers every day whether in our stores manufacturing plants distribution centers or offices reduction in operatingcosts as a percentage ofsales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way we strive to be disciplined so that as the company grows expenses are properly managed this metric is included in both the annual cash bonus plan and long term incentive plans operating costs without fuel can be improved temporarily on an annual basis but it is more difficult to maintain these reductions over time it is the role of the approximately employees in the long term incentive plan to continue to reduce operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel over time and to ensure such reductions are sustainable over the long term including this metric in the long term incentive plan incentivizes these key employees to implement policies for sustainable improvement over a long period of time roic part of our long term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time we have a pipeline of high quality projects and new store openings and we continue to increase the square footage in our fill in markets with increased capital spend it is essential that we achieve the proper returns on our investments this measure is intended to hold executives accountable for the returns on the increased capital investments operating costs is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel operating costs will exclude one time expenses incurred in lieu of future anticipated obligations future expenses that are avoided by virtue of the incurrence of the one time expense will be deemed to be total operating expenses in the year in which they otherwise would have been incurred return on invested capital is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital will be calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes the following table summarizes the long term

compensation table and footnotes and to that table and the common shares issued under the plan are reported in the option exercises and stock vested table and footnote to that table stock options and restricted stock stock options and restricted stock continue to play an important role in rewarding neos for the achievement of long term business objectives and providing incentives for the creation of shareholder value awards based on krogers common shares are granted annually to the neos and a large number of other employees kroger historically has distributed time based equity awards widely aligning the interests of employees with your interest as shareholders in kroger granted stock options to approximately employees including the neos the options permit the holder to purchase kroger common shares at an option price equal to the closing price of kroger common shares on the date of the grant during kroger awarded shares of restricted stock to approximately employees including the neos options are granted only on one of the four dates of board meetings conducted after krogers public release of its quarterly earnings results the compensation committee determines the vesting schedule for stock options and restricted stock during the compensation committee granted to the neos a stock options with a five year vesting schedule and b restricted stock with a three or five year vesting schedule as discussed below under stock ownership guidelines covered individuals including the neos must hold of common shares issued pursuant to performance units earned the shares received upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of restricted stock except those necessary to pay the exercise price of the options and or applicable taxes until applicable stock ownership guidelines are met unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo retirement and other benefits kroger maintains a defined benefit and several defined contribution retirement plans for its employees the neos participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding certain retirement benefits available to the neos can be found below in the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative description that follows this discussion and analysis kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the neos participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year additional details regarding our nonqualified deferred compensation plans available to the neos can be found below in the nonqualified deferred compensation table and the accompanying narrative kroger also maintains the kroger co employee protection plan kepp which covers all of our management employees and administrative support personnel who have provided services to kroger for at least one year and whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described in the plan when an employee is actually or constructively terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of kroger as defined in kepp participants are entitled to severance pay of up to months salary and bonus the actual amount is dependent upon pay level and years of service kepp can be amended or terminated by the board at any time prior to a change in control performance based long term cash bonus performance unit stock option and restricted stock agreements with award recipients provide that those awards vest with of the long term cash bonus potential being paid common shares equal to of the performance units being awarded options becoming immediately exercisable and restrictions on restricted stock lapsing upon a change in control as described in the grant agreements none of the neos is party to an employment agreement perquisites neos receive limited perquisites because the compensation committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide the neos a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the only perquisites available to our neos were premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance and premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies because he was an officer of harris teeter during mr morganthall also was eligible for the following harris teeter perquisites premiums paid on executive bonus insurance policies and tax reimbursements for the taxes due on insurance premiums paid by harris teeter the total amount of perquisites furnished to the neos is shown in the summary compensation table and described in more detail in footnote to that table process for establishing executive compensation the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of our executive officers including the neos with the exception of the chief executive officer the compensation committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those members of the board establish the ceos compensation the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the compensation committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the compensation committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the compensation committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target performance based annual cash bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual cash bonus potential annualized long term compensation such as performance based long term cash bonus potential and performance units stock options and restricted stock and total direct compensation the sum of target annual cash compensation and annualized long term compensation the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded food and drug retailers for our peer group consisted of costco wholesale supervalu cvs health formerly cvs caremark target rite aid wal mart safeway walgreens boots alliance formerly walgreen this peer group is the same group as was used in median revenue for the peer group was billion compared to our revenue of billion the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant industry consolidation and other competitive forces will result in changes to the peer group over time the consultant also provides the compensation committee data from general industry companies a representation of major publicly traded companies of similar size and scope from outside the retail industry this data serves as reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the compensation committee believes that salaries paid to our neos should be at or above the median paid by peer group companies for comparable positions the compensation committee also aims to provide an annual cash bonus potential to our neos that if the increasingly more challenging annual business plan objectives are achieved at superior levels would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the baselines established by the compensation committee the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos compensation in setting total compensation the independent directors consider the median compensation of the peer groups ceos with respect to the annual bonus the independent directors make two determinations they determine the annual cash bonus potential that will be multiplied by the annual cash bonus payout percentage earned that is generally applicable to all corporate management including the neos and the independent directors determine the annual cash bonus amount paid to the ceo by retaining discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive under the formulaic plan the compensation committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other neos in its annual review of compensation for the neos the compensation committee conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the neos on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each neo of salary performance based annual cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation stock options restricted stock accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits company paid health and welfare benefits banked vacation severance benefits available under kepp and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the compensation committee has determined that the compensation of the ceo and that of the other neos bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the compensation committees compensation consultants comparing neo and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies including both our peer group of competitors and a larger general industry group to ensure that the compensation committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary annual cash bonus potential and long term compensation awards for each of the senior officers including the other neos the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the compensation committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team in considering each of the factors above the compensation committee does not make use of a formula but rather quantitatively reviews each factor in setting compensation advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting we held our fifth annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory proposal in the compensation committee believes it conveys our shareholders support of the compensation committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs as a result the compensation committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs or our pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting in keeping with our shareholders request for an annual advisory vote we will again hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the compensation committee will continue to consider the results from this years and future advisory votes on executive compensation in their evaluation and administration of our compensation program stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our officers and directors

material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual cash bonus or a long term cash bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the compensation committee then the officer upon demand from the compensation committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the compensation committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment compensation policies as they relate to risk management as part of the compensation committees review of our compensation practices the compensation committee considers and analyzes the extent to which risks arise from such practices and their impact on krogers business as discussed in this discussion and analysis our policies and practices for compensating employees are designed to among other things attract and retain high quality and engaged employees in this process the compensation committee also focuses on minimizing risk through the implementation of certain practices and policies such as the executive compensation recoupment policy which is described above under executive compensation recoupment policy clawback accordingly we do not believe that our compensation practices and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on kroger prohibition on hedging and pledging after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board has adopted a policy regarding hedging pledging and short sales of kroger securities kroger directors and officers are prohibited from engaging directly or indirectly in hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities in addition the policy was further revised as of april to preclude kroger officers and directors from pledging kroger securities section m of the internal revenue code tax laws place a deductibility limit of on some types of compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers other than the chief financial officer reported in this proxy because they are among the four highest compensated officers covered employees in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of neos compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the covered employees is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria which have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the covered employees should be deductible by kroger krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is material and supports krogers compensation philosophy the compensation committee also will attempt to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by kroger compensation committee report the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management of the company the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this proxy statement based on its review and discussions with management the

our compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals our incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation to achieve our objectives we seek to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so we are guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of executives and shareholders and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation rather the

will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that they intend to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the kroger companyhuman rights risk assessment resolved that shareholders of the kroger co kroger urge the board of directors to report to shareholders at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information on krogers process for identifying and analyzing potential and actual human rights risks of krogers operations and supply chain referred to herein as a human rights risk assessment addressing the following human rights principles used to frame the assessment frequency of assessment methodology used to track and measure performance nature and extent of consultation with relevant stakeholders in connection with the assessment how the results of the assessment are incorporated into company policies and decision making the report should be made available to shareholders on krogers website no later than october supporting statement as long term shareholders we favor policies and practices that protect and enhance the value of our investments there is increasing recognition that company risks related to human rights violations such as litigation reputational damage and project delays and disruptions can adversely affect shareholder value kroger like many other companies has adopted a supplier code of conduct see the kroger company standard vendor agreement but has yet to publish a company wide human rights policy addressing human rights issues and a separate human rights code that applies to its suppliers adoption of these principles would be an important first step in effectively managing human rights risks companies must then assess risks to shareholder value of human rights practices in their operations and supply chains to translate principles into protective practices the importance of human rights risk assessment is reflected in the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights the ruggie principles approved by the un human rights council in the ruggie principles urge that business enterprises should carry out human rights due diligence assessing actual and potential human rights impacts integrating and acting upon the findings tracking responses and communicating how impacts are addressed http www business humanrights org media documents ruggie ruggie guiding principles mar pdf krogers business exposes it to significant human rights risks as of year end kroger operations including supermarkets convenience and jewelry stores are located in over states while over of krogers business is food its vendor code of conduct is based heavily on compliance with the law and u s agricultural workers are excluded from many labor laws that apply to other u s workers the companys supply chain is complex and global and violations of human rights in krogers supply chain can lead to negative publicity public protests and a loss of consumer confidence that can have a negative impact on shareholder value we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons like the proponents the board also recognizes the importance of ensuring that those seeking to do business with us respect basic human rights however the board opposes this proposal because we are already working to ensure an ethical supply chain for the products sold in our stores and we have a zero tolerance policy for human rights violations furthermore we regularly consider our policies and practices and we have recently taken several important steps to drive into our supply chain greater responsibility and accountability in after consultation with a number of stakeholders we updated our vendor code of conduct the code of conduct which is available at www thekrogerco com the new code of conduct makes it clear that our suppliers and their suppliers are expected to live up to our standards as set forth in the code of conduct to the extent they do not live up to such standards we will not do business with them in we created a social responsibility center of excellence the center of excellence to schedule review and monitor social responsibility audits assess risks such as those described above and develop a reporting structure that informs our business decisions the center of excellence is also tasked with recommending ways to continually improve social accountability in our supply chain in our annual sustainability report included a more in depth report on our social responsibility activities which is available at sustainability kroger com since we have more than doubled the number of social responsibility audits we have conducted and we expect this program to continue to grow this past year our work revealed several facility failures many of these facilities have significantly improved through corrective action plans but we are no longer doing business with a few in we made the kroger social responsibility audit checklist the audit checklist available online the audit checklist is required for kroger suppliers that our social responsibility team identifies as higher risk due to variables such as country product and or industry in commodities and or regions that are higher risk like farmed shrimp in thailand we not only request supplier audits but also work with third party environmental and social certification programs to further eliminate risk in the supply chain in kroger will also conduct a third party review of commodities in our supply chain to further assess both environmental and social risks we expect our program to continue to evolve and develop based on input from suppliers customers government non governmental organizations and developments within the industry we believe that these efforts represent significant and positive steps forward for our companys social responsibility program kroger is already actively implementing monitoring and continually improving our policies and practices addressing a number of the areas discussed by the proponent we believe that preparation of an additional report would not be an efficient use of our shareholders resources we urge you to vote against this proposal item no shareholder proposal we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting shareholder proposalrecyclability of packaging whereas a portion of kroger house brand product packaging is unrecyclable including plastics which are a growing component of marine litter authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life spreads toxics and poses a potential threat to human health plastic is the fastest growing form of packaging u s flexible plastic sales are estimated at billion dried fruit frozen meat cheese and dog food are some of the kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches private label items account for a quarter of all sales nearly billion annually using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources william mcdonough a leading green design advisor calls pouch packaging a monstrous hybrid designed to end up either in a landfill or incinerator recyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious yet recycling rates stagnate only of plastic packaging is recycled according to the u s environmental protection agency epa billions of pouches and similar plastic laminates representing significant embedded value lie buried in landfills unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways a recent assessment of marine debris by a panel of the global environment facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled in the marine environment plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food studies by the epa suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent bio accumulative toxic chemicals plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets one study of fish from the north pacific found one or more plastic chemicals in all fish tested independent of location and species california spends nearly million annually preventing trash much of it packaging from polluting beaches rivers and oceanfront making all packaging recyclable if possible is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by ocean debris companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging other companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability procter gamble and colgate palmolive agreed to make most of their packaging recyclable by keurig green mountain will make k cup coffee pods recyclable and mcdonalds and dunkin donuts shifted away from foam plastic cups which cannot be readily recycled resolved shareowners of kroger request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging supporting statement proponents believe that the report should include an assessment of the reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging and if possible goals and a timeline to phase out unrecyclable packaging the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding plastic recyclability and recognizes the important role we play as a good steward of the environment we continue to improve the recyclability of our corporate brand products while still preserving their safety and quality more specifically we follow a balanced multi pronged approach to optimizing packaging design that considers factors such as food safety shelf life availability quality material type function recyclability and cost among others we are increasingly labeling recyclable corporate brand products per the federal trade commissions green guides prompting our customers to please recycle one example is through our redesign of kroger brand milks creams and orange juices that come in quart pint and half pint packages the packaging for these products is comprised of a bottle made from polyethylene terephthalate pete one of the most widely recycled plastics available and a shrink sleeve while the shrink sleeve is also made from pete these shrink sleeves may interfere with the ability of the bottles to be segregated and recycled when a recycling facility uses optical scanning technology as a result in order to increase the number of corporate brand pete bottles that can be properly recycled we have added a tear perforation and the consumer message remove label to recycle bottle to the shrink labels we recognize that creating lasting sustainable consumption patterns requires a comprehensive approach and so we also work with various industry experts and forums to advocate for expanded recycling infrastructure to support both multiple forms of plastic packaging and diversion from landfills additionally our banner brand bread bags are made from low density polyethylene ldpe this type of plastic can be a contaminant in many single stream recycling programs to help our customers recycle their ldpe bread bags we have added customer communication on the bag that reads please recycle at your local kroger family of stores drop off location these drop off recycling bins are part of our plastic bag recycling program and are typically located in the front vestibule of our stores along with bread bags customers can also recycle clean and dry plastic bags bottled water case wraps bathroom tissue and diaper plastic overwraps dry cleaning bags and newspaper bags this program is currently undergoing rebranding and expansion to encourage customers to recycle even more in and beyond for each of the past several years we have published online our annual sustainability report that highlights our sustainability initiatives and waste reduction efforts in greater detail available at sustainability kroger com in that report we set forth a rigorous and tangible goal to strive to have zero waste in our retail locations through this initiative and others we will continue to support efforts to reduce waste find optimized solutions and advocate for expanded recycling infrastructure as we believe these efforts are significant and meaningful we urge you to support these efforts and vote against this proposal item no

request that kroger produce a report by year end assessing the climate benefits and feasibility of adopting enterprise wide quantitative time bound targets for increasing krogers renewable energy sourcing the report should be produced at reasonable cost and exclude proprietary information supporting shareholders request that the report include an analysis of options and scenarios for achieving renewable energy targets for example by using on site distributed energy off site generation power purchases and renewable energy credits or other opportunities management would like to consider at its discretion the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding renewable energy sourcing we are committed to environmental sustainability and we strive to reduce our impact on the environment by using natural resources responsibly and minimizing waste in all of our operations our aggressive work in energy management resulted in a reduction of overall energy consumption in our stores saving more than billion kwh since this is the carbon equivalent of taking cars off the road for one year we are actively working to do more in both the short and long term for example our turkey hill dairy has two wind energy turbines with megawatt capacity since these turbines have supplied up to of the dairys annual electricity needs which is enough power to produce six million gallons of ice cream and million gallons of iced tea in addition ten kroger stores have approximately kw of solar energy capacity that in produced approximately million kwh the kroger recovery system located in compton ca at the ralphs food less distribution center has been in operation since late it utilizes anaerobic digestion a naturally occurring process to transform food waste into renewable biogas this system annually processes approximately tons of food waste this biogas is then turned into power for onsite operations the system provided approximately million kwh of renewable energy for the square foot ralphs food less distribution center the system reduces area truck trips by more than miles each year and reduces waste costs these efforts are estimated to reduce carbon emissions by tons per year for each of the past several years we have published online our annual sustainability report that highlights our sustainability initiatives and waste reduction efforts in greater detail we will continue to support efforts to increase our renewable energy sourcing as we believe these efforts are significant and meaningful you can view our sustainability report at sustainability kroger com where we address a number of the requests made by the proponent including quantitative enterprise wide renewable energy production metrics and supply chain management through our logistics initiative we remain committed to environmental sustainability and renewable energy sourcing and we will continue to publish reports to our shareholders tracking our initiatives we urge you to support the furthering of our current programs and vote against this proposal item no shareholder proposal we have been notified by

the following resolution at the annual meeting shareholder proposalshare repurchase vs dividend resolved shareholders of the kroger co ask the board of directors to adopt and issue a general payout policy that gives preference to share repurchases relative to cash dividends as a method to return capital to shareholders if a general payout policy currently exists we ask that it be amended appropriately supporting statement share repurchases as a method to return capital to shareholders have distinct advantages relative to dividends share repurchases should be preferred for the following reasons financial flexibility four professors from duke university and cornell university studied executives decisions to pay dividends or make repurchases by surveying hundreds of executives of public companies they found that maintaining the dividend level is on par with investment decisions while repurchases are made out of the residual cash flow after investment spending further in follow up interviews as part of the study executives state d that they would pass up some positive net present value npv investment projects before cutting dividends the creation of long term value is of paramount importance i believe that repurchases have the distinct advantage that they do not create an incentive to forgo long term value enhancing projects in order to preserve a historic dividend level tax efficiency share repurchases have been described in the wall street journal as akin to dividends but without the tax bite for shareholders the distribution of a dividend may automatically trigger a tax liability for some shareholders the repurchase of shares does not necessarily trigger that automatic tax liability and therefore gives a shareholder the flexibility to choose when the tax liability is incurred shareholders who desire cash flow can choose to sell shares and pay taxes as appropriate this proposal does not constitute tax advice market acceptance some may believe that slowing the growth rate or reducing the level of dividends would result in a negative stock market reaction however a study published in the journal of finance finds that the market response to cutting dividends by companies that were also share repurchasers was not statistically distinguishable from zero i believe this study provides evidence that there is market acceptance that repurchases are valid substitutes for dividends some may worry that share repurchases could be used to prop up metrics that factor into the compensation of executives i believe that any such concern should not interfere with the choice of optimal payout mechanism because compensation packages can be designed such that metrics are adjusted to account for share repurchases in summary i strongly believe that adopting a general payout policy that gives preference to share repurchases would enhance long term value creation i urge shareholders to vote for this proposal http www sciencedirect com science article pii s xo http www wsj com articles companies stock buybacks help buoy the market http www afajof org details journalarticle dividends share repurchases and the substitution hypothesis html the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger believes that the policy advocated by the shareholder proposal is not in the best interests of our shareholders as it reduces long term flexibility in the allocation of capital in a rapidly evolving capital market this flexibility is an essential element in the careful management of shareholder capital which the board thoughtfully oversees and reviews on a regular basis our long term financial strategy continues to be to use cash flow from operations in a balanced manner to repurchase shares fund dividends and increase capital investments all while maintaining our current investment grade debt rating our balanced approach gives us the flexibility to pursue long term growth strategies while returning capital to our shareholders kroger is proud of our strong history of capital return to shareholders we have made significant commitments over time to return capital to shareholders both through repurchases of our common shares and payment of cash dividends we repurchased million of kroger common shares in as well as billion in million in and billion in additionally we paid dividends totaling million in million in million in and million in we are also committed to growing long term shareholder value through significant capital investments excluding acquisitions we invested billion billion billion and billion in capital projects in and respectively many of our shareholders view both dividends and share repurchases as an important component of krogers investment profile especially in light of our balanced capital return strategy that contributes to a healthy tsr total shareholder return which outperforms both our peers and the sp over time when contemplating capital returns the board engages in a thorough analysis and oversight process before the board approves any share repurchase program or declares a cash dividend it takes into account a wide range of factors including krogers short and long term growth strategies liquidity needs and capital requirements cash flows net earnings debt obligations and leverage ratios the board also considers how the then current capital market conditions affect krogers policies and strategies there is no one size fits all policy or strategy in returning capital to shareholders that would satisfy each market condition over the course of time balanced capital allocation decisions overseen by an effective board remain the most effective and flexible strategy to continuously deliver healthy value to shareholders over the long term this proposal requests that kroger adopt a general policy that gives preference to share repurchases relative to cash dividends we urge you to vote against this

of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores combo stores multi department stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce multi department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multi department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi department stores they offer full service grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys price impact warehouse stores offer a no frills low cost warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is

operations than do the generally accepted accounting principle gaap measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of

management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in evaluating our results of operations as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of operating

quarters although identical supermarket sales is a relatively standard term numerous methods exist for calculating identical supermarket sales growth as a result the method used by our management to calculate identical supermarket sales may differ from methods other companies use to calculate identical supermarket sales we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate identical supermarket sales before comparing our identical supermarket sales to those of other such companies fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multi department stores and include roundys sales for the last six weeks of fiscal for stores that are identical as if they were part of the company in the prior year we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below identical supermarket sales dollars in millions including supermarket

lower growth rate in retail fuel sales as compared to the growth rate for the total company increases the gross margin rates as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year we calculate fifo gross margin as sales less merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation expenses but excluding the lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses our lifo charge was million in million in and million in fifo gross margin is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance a with gaap fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day to day merchandising and operational effectiveness our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were in in and in our retail fuel operations lower our fifo gross margin rate as a percentage of sales due to the very low fifo gross margin rate on retail fuel as compared to non fuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rate decreased four basis points in as a

opened opened relocation acquired closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions return on invested capital we calculate return on invested capital roic by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding back our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent to our u s gaap operating profit of the prior four quarters average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes averages are calculated for roic by adding the beginning balance of the first a quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors analysts and rating agencies roic is a non gaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies the following table provides a calculation of roic for and the calculation of roic excludes the financial position results and merger costs for the roundys transaction january january return on invested capital numerator operating profit lifo charge depreciation

on invested capital taxes receivable were as of january as of january and as of february the increase in taxes receivable as of january compared to as of january is due to recently issued tangible property regulations refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further detail other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of as of january and as of february we did not have any accrued income taxes as of january accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital a critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both workers compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability claims are not discounted the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in million in and million in we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense a the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of january we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively reporting units that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value in goodwill increased million primarily due to our merger with roundys in goodwill increased million primarily due to our merger with vitacost com for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for roundys and vitacost com refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and see note to the consolidated financial statements the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions a we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings if any in merchandise costs we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred post retirement benefit plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plans cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plans projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of and as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january by approximately million to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in our assumed pension plan investment return rate was compared to in and in our pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december net of investment management fees and expenses decreased for the past years our average annual rate of return has been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe a rate of return assumption is reasonable for see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets on january we adopted new mortality tables including industry based tables for annuitants reflecting more current mortality experience and assumptions for future generational mortality improvement in calculating our projected benefit obligations as of january and january and our pension expense the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increased our benefit obligation and future expenses we used the rp projected to mortality table in calculating our year end pension obligation and and pension expense a sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of krogers pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions projected benefit percentage obligation expense point decrease decrease change increase increase discount rate expected return on assets in we contributed million to our company sponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to these plans in in we did not contribute to our company sponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in we did not make a contribution in and contributed million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions we contributed and expensed million in million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts the increase in compared to is due to a higher employee savings rate the increase in compared to is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter the k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service multi employer pension plans we contribute to various multi employer pension plans including the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements we are designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets these multi employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans in we contributed million to the ufcw consolidated pension plan we had previously accrued million of the total contributions at january and recorded expense for the remaining million at the time of payment in in we incurred a charge of million after tax related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements of which million was contributed to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in as of january we are not required to contribute to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of million in million in and million in based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets i e the amount of underfunding as of december because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our share of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer as of december we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which we contribute was approximately billion pre tax or a billion after tax which includes roundys share of underfunding of its multi employer plans this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately billion pre tax or approximately million after tax as of december compared to december the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans during changes in mortality rate assumptions and the merger of roundys our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi employer pension plans uncertain tax positions we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of our and federal tax returns tax years and remain under examination the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse a inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately of inventories in and were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by billion at january and january we follow the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately billion in billion in and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns recently adopted accounting standards in the

partially offset by payments at maturity of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of the increase in financing obligations was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to range from to billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital investments interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and because we have consistent access to the capital markets based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately million of commercial paper and billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the range of to billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the companys share repurchase programs we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper cp program at january we had million of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding the increase as of march compared to year end was due to partially funding our outstanding common share repurchases our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio were to exceed to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio fell below to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end a the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans which totaled million in the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined as of january we had million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability related to workers compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis amounts include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets amounts include commitments many of which are short term in nature to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our food production plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and food production plants our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of january we maintained a billion with the ability to increase by million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on june outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement as of january we had million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january a in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january we had authorized for issuance million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about our future performance these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it such statements are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially the guidance below includes our expectations for roundys we expect net earnings to be to per diluted share which is essentially in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by actual fuel margins which we expect to be at or slightly below the five year average with continued volatility we expect our core business in to grow in line with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in reflecting the lower inflationary environment we expect full year fifo operating margin in excluding fuel to expand slightly compared to results a we expect capital investments excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be to billion these capital investments include approximately major projects covering new stores expansions and relocations including ruler locations to major remodels and other investments including minor remodels and technology and infrastructure to support our customer st business strategy we expect total supermarket square footage for to grow approximately before mergers acquisitions and operational closings we expect year end roic to increase slightly compared to the result we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the resolution of certain tax items in we anticipate annualized product cost inflation of to excluding fuel and an annualized lifo charge of approximately million we expect inflation to be lower during the earlier portion of and to gradually rise during the later portion of we expect company sponsored pension plans expense to be approximately million we do not expect to make a cash contribution in in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate agreements with ufcw for store associates in houston indianapolis little rock nashville portland southern california and frys in arizona negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending volatility of fuel margins changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors consolidation in the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit managers our ability to negotiate modifications to multi employer pension plans natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber attacks or data security breaches the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter and roundys our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow a during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since fuel generates lower profit margins than our supermarket sales we expect to see our fifo gross margins decline as fuel sales increase we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on krogers business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives we undertake no

companys consolidated balance sheets goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of a triggering event the company performs reviews of each of its operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively reporting units that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a reporting unit is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note a impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if the company identifies impairment for long lived assets to be held and used the company compares the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows the company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal the company recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling and in and respectively costs to reduce the carrying value

the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to income in the proper period owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the companys policy on impairment of long lived assets

its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci all plans are measured as of the companys fiscal year end the determination of the obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company also participates in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees pension expense for these plans is recognized as

utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the companys approach is to include in the merchandise costs line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold advertising costs the companys advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related

company believes that allowances for loss have been provided to the extent necessary and that its assessment of contingencies is reasonable to the extent that resolution of contingencies results in amounts that vary from the companys estimates future earnings will be charged or credited the principal contingencies are described below insurance the companys workers compensation risks are self insured in most states in addition other workers compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans deductible plans and self insured retention plans the liability for workers compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are all reinsured with unrelated insurance companies operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances based upon actuarially determined estimates a litigation various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and or seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and when an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involves substantial uncertainties management currently believes that the aggregate range of loss for the companys exposure is not material to the company it remains possible that despite managements current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in managements evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows assignments the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees is unable to fulfill its lease obligations due to the wide distribution of the companys assignments among third parties and various other remedies available the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote stock preferred shares the company has authorized five million shares of voting cumulative preferred shares two million

benefit obligation a the companys discount rate assumptions were intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled they take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the companys policy is to match the plans cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plans projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january by approximately to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by the company for the company

investment return rate to compared to in the company pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all

been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with the companys target allocations the company believes a rate of return assumption is reasonable the company calculates its expected return on plan assets by using the market related value of plan assets the market related value of plan assets is determined by adjusting the actual fair value of plan assets for gains or losses on plan assets gains or losses represent the difference between actual and expected returns on plan investments for each plan year gains or losses on plan assets are recognized evenly over a five year period using a different method to calculate the market related value of plan assets would provide a different expected return on plan assets on january

objectives policies and strategies are set by the pension investment committees the committees appointed by the ceo the primary objectives include holding and investing the assets and distributing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the pension plans investment objectives have been established based on a comprehensive review of the capital markets and each underlying plans current and projected financial requirements the time horizon of the investment objectives is long term in nature and plan assets are managed on a going concern basis investment objectives and guidelines specifically applicable to each manager of assets are established and reviewed annually derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes including rebalancing exposures to certain asset classes any use of derivative instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited unless approved in advance by the committees a the current target allocations shown represent the targets that were established in the company will rebalance by liquidating assets whose allocation materially exceeds target if possible and investing in assets whose allocation is materially below target if markets are illiquid the company may not be able to rebalance to target quickly to maintain actual asset allocations consistent with target allocations assets are reallocated or rebalanced periodically in addition cash flow from employer contributions and participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes as appropriate the company expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs the company is not required and does not expect to make any contributions to the qualified plans in if the company does make any contributions in the company expects these contributions will decrease its required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions the company expects expense for company sponsored pension plans to be approximately in addition the company expects k retirement savings account plans cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to be approximately in assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans the company used a initial health care cost trend rate which is assumed to decrease on a linear basis to a ultimate health care cost trend rate in to determine its expense a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates
