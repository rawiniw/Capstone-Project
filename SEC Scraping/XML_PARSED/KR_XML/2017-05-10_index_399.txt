committees conduct an annual self evaluation to determine whether the board is functioning effectively as a board and at the committee level as part of this annual self evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure and function continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders the guidelines provide the flexibility for the board to modify our leadership

information furnished by all members regarding their relationships with kroger and its management and other relevant information the board considered among other things that the value of any business transactions between kroger and entities with which the directors are affiliated falls below the thresholds identified by the nyse listing standards and none had any material relationships with kroger except for those arising directly from their performance of services as a director for kroger audit committee expertise the board has determined that anne gates ronald l sargent and mark s sutton independent directors who are members of the audit committee are audit committee financial experts as defined by applicable sec regulations and that all members of the audit committee are financially

that director served members of the board are expected to use their best efforts to attend all annual meetings of shareholders all eleven members then serving on the board attended last years annual meeting independent compensation consultants the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the compensation committee in the design of krogers executive compensation in fiscal kroger paid that consultant for work performed for the compensation committee kroger on managements recommendation retained the parent and affiliated companies of mercer human resource consulting to provide other services for kroger in fiscal for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to insurance claims for which kroger was reimbursed by insurance carriers as claims were adjusted insurance brokerage and bonding commissions provided by marsh usa inc and pension plan compliance and actuary services provided by mercer inc kroger also made payments to affiliated companies for insurance premiums that were collected by the affiliated companies on behalf of insurance carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the compensation committee nor the board expressly approved the other services after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the compensation committee determined that the consultant is independent and his work has not raised any conflict of interest because the consultant was first engaged by the compensation committee before he became associated with mercer the consultant works exclusively for the compensation committee and not for our management the consultant does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services for kroger the compensation committee may engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable compensation committee interlocks and insider

chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective board committees regarding management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by the lead director to exercise effective oversight of the

largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent as well as motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals krogers incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation the compensation committee believes that there is a strong link between our business strategy the performance metrics in our short term and long term incentive programs and the business results that drive shareholder value we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our focus on our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of executives and shareholders components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the compensation committee has three related objectives regarding compensation first the compensation committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that officers fill at kroger second a majority of compensation should help align the interests of our officers with the interests of our shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our neos is comprised of the following annual compensation salary performance based annual cash bonus long term compensation performance based long term incentive plan consisting of a long term cash bonus and performance units non qualified stock options restricted stock retirement and other benefits limited perquisites the annual and long term performance based compensation awards described herein were made pursuant to our long term incentive and cash bonus plan which was approved by our shareholders in annual compensationsalary our philosophy with respect to salary is to provide a sufficient and stable source of fixed cash compensation all of our compensation cannot be at risk or long term it is important to provide a meaningful annual salary to attract and retain a high caliber leadership team and to have an appropriate level of cash compensation that is not variable salaries for the neos with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the compensation committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by all of the independent directors salaries for the neos are reviewed annually in june the amount of each neos salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the compensation committee or in the case of the ceo of the compensation committee and the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure in role and relationship to other kroger executives salaries the assessment of individual contribution is a qualitative determination based on the following factors leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the amounts shown below reflect the salaries of the neos effective at the end of each fiscal year salary w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael j donnelly christopher t hjelm frederick j morganthall ii mr mcmullen was named ceo of kroger as of january and chairman of the board as of january messrs schlotman donnelly hjelm and morganthall were each promoted to the position of executive vice president effective september messrs hjelm and morganthall became neos in annual compensationperformance based annual cash bonus the neos along with approximately of their fellow kroger associates participate in a performance based annual cash bonus plan approximately of those associates are eligible for the same plan as the neos the remaining associates are eligible for an annual cash bonus plan of which is based on the kroger corporate plan and is based on the metrics and targets for their respective supermarket division or operating unit of the company over time the compensation committee and our independent directors have placed an increased emphasis on our strategic plan by making the targets more difficult to achieve the annual cash bonus plan is structured to encourage high levels of performance a threshold level of performance must be achieved before any payouts are earned while a payout of up to of target can be achieved for superior performance the amount of annual cash bonus that the neos earn each year is based upon krogers performance compared to targets established by the compensation committee and the independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors the annual cash bonus plan is designed to encourage decisions and behavior that drive the annual operating results and the long term success of the company krogers success is based on a combination of factors and accordingly the compensation committee believes that it is important to encourage behavior that supports multiple elements of our business strategy establishing annual cash bonus potentials the compensation committee establishes annual cash bonus potentials for each neo other than the ceo whose annual cash bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the goals established by the compensation committee actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the goals established by the compensation committee or as high as of the potential bonus amount if the performance far exceeds these pre established goals the compensation committee considers multiple factors in making its determination or recommendation as to annual cash bonus potentials the individuals level within the organization as the compensation committee believes that more senior executives should have a more substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance the individuals salary as the compensation committee believes that a significant portion of a neos total cash compensation should be dependent upon krogers performance the individuals level in the organization and the internal relationship of annual cash bonus potentials within kroger individual performance the recommendation of the ceo for all neos other than the ceo and the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding annual cash bonus potential and total compensation awarded by our peer group the annual cash bonus potential in effect at the end of the fiscal year for each neo is shown below actual annual cash bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual cash bonus potential w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael j donnelly christopher t hjelm frederick j morganthall ii mr mcmullen was named ceo of kroger as of january and chairman of the board as of january messrs schlotman donnelly hjelm and morganthall were each promoted to the position of executive vice president effective september messrs hjelm and morganthall became neos in annual cash bonus plan metrics and connection to our business plan the annual cash bonus plan had the following measurable performance metrics all of which are interconnected and individually necessary to sustain our business model and achieve our growth strategy metric weight rationale for use id sales id sales represent sales without fuel at our supermarkets that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our sales across the enterprise a key driver of our model is strong id sales it is the engine that fuels our growth net operating profit without supermarket fuel operating profit net operating profit this metric changed from ebitda to net operating profit the difference being depreciation because we are investing significant capital into assets we changed this metric to focus on an earnings result that includes the amortization of that investment net operating profit is an important way for us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we cannot achieve solid net operating profit without a strong operating model this is the best measure of the profitability of the business taking into account the capital invested to generate the earnings unlike earnings per share which can be affected by management decisions on share buybacks this measure of earnings is relevant for all of our approximately associates who are eligible for the annual cash bonus plan customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four keys of our customer st strategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric includes a mixture of strategic and operational metrics that measure the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys annual cash bonus payout is based on certain elements of the customer st strategy to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year total operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity andefficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way we strive to be disciplined so that as the company grows expenses are properly managed total of metrics clicklist bonus kicker an additional is earned if kroger achieves certain goals with respect to our clicklist expansion and operations the change from last years kicker based on fuel reflects our focus on a different aspect of the business this year the clicklist bonus was added to the annual cash bonus plan as an incentive to encourage the addition of clicklist locations at a faster rate while maintaining certain operating and financial standards the clicklist bonus of is only available if the pre determined measures are met if any of the goals are not met no portion of the clicklist bonus is earned net operating profit is calculated as gross profit minus operating general and administrative expenses minus depreciation and amortization excluding supermarket fuel and the non kroger portion of earnings of consolidated variable interest entities total operating costs is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without supermarket fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel the use of these four primary metrics creates checks and balances on the various behaviors and decisions that impact the long term success of the company the id sales net operating profit and customer st strategy metrics are weighted equally to highlight the need to simultaneously achieve all three metrics in order to maintain our growth we aligned the weighting of id sales and net operating profit metrics to emphasize sales growth balanced with the focus on profit krogers business is not sustainable if we merely increase our id sales but do not have a corresponding increase in earnings furthermore payouts in the id sales and net operating profit metrics are interrelated a certain minimum payoff level on id sales must be reached for the net operating profit metric to exceed similarly a certain minimum payoff level on net operating profit must be reached for the payoff on the id sales metric to exceed in addition a certain minimum payoff level on both the id sales metric and net operating profit metric must be reached for the payoff of the customer st strategy metric to exceed by supporting the customer st strategy and the four keys we will better connect with our customers our unique competitive advantage is our ability to deliver on the four keys which are the items that matter most to our customers as we strive to achieve our aggressive growth targets we also continuously aim to reduce our total operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel productivity improvements and other reductions in operating costs allow us to reduce costs in areas that do not matter to our customers so that we can invest money in the areas that matter the most to our customers like the four keys we carefully manage operating cost reductions to ensure a consistent delivery of the customer experience this again shows the need to have multiple metrics to create checks and balances on the various behavior and decisions that are influenced by the design of the bonus plan results of annual cash bonus plan the goals established by the compensation committee the actual results and the bonus percentage earned for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as follows goals actualperformance comparedto target a performance metrics minimum target actualperformance weight b amountearned a x b id sales net operating profit billion billion billion customer st strategy total operating costs as percentage of sales without fuel overbudgetby basispoints overbudgetby basispoints overbudgetby basispoints clicklist bonus or total earned the customer st strategy goal also was established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive total operating costs without fuel were budgeted at as a percentage of sales for fiscal year an additional would have been earned if kroger had achieved certain goals with respect to its clicklist expansion and operation these goals were established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but are not disclosed as they are competitively sensitive following the close of the year the compensation committee reviewed krogers performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives the compensation committee determined that krogers results in did not meet some of our business objectives due to our performance when compared to the goals established by the compensation committee the neos earned of their bonus potentials in as in all years the compensation committee retained discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus payout for all executive officers including the neos if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate given their assessment of company performancehowever no adjustments were made in that affected neo bonuses the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus the compensation committee and the independent directors also retained discretion to adjust the goals for each metric under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo determined that the annual cash bonus payouts earned appropriately reflected the companys performance in and therefore should not be adjusted the actual annual cash bonus percentage payout for represented performance that did not meet all of our business plan objectives the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of earned amounts under our annual cash bonus plan in previous years such as and when payouts significantly exceeded in those years we achieved and or exceeded all of our business plan objectives a comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage payouts in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance fiscal year annual cash bonus payout percentage as described above the annual cash bonus payout percentage is applied to each neos bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo the actual amounts of performance based annual cash bonuses paid to the neos for are reported in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the neos to achieve the long term goals established by the board as such a majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the companys long term goals and is delivered via four long term compensation vehicles long term cash bonus performance units stock options and restricted stock long term compensation promotes long term value creation and discourages the over emphasis of attaining short term goals at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee considers several factors in determining the target value of long term compensation awarded to the neos or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding long term compensation awarded by our peer group the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all neos other than the ceo long term incentives are structured to be a combination of performance and time based compensation that reflects elements of financial and common shares performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit payouts are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial measures and incentivize recipients to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the companys long term strategic goals stock options and restricted stock are linked to common shares performance creating alignment between executives and company shareholders options have no initial value and recipients only realize benefits if the value of our common shares increases following the date of grant a majority of long term compensation is equity based performance units stock options and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common shares further aligning the interests of our neos with our shareholders all four components of long term compensation are intended to focus executive behaviors on our long term strategy each component is described in more detail below amounts of long term compensation awards issued and outstanding for the neos are set forth in the executive compensation tables section long term incentive plan design in contrast to the performance based annual cash bonus plan described above which has approximately participants our performance based long term incentive plan has approximately participants including the neos each year we adopt a similar long term incentive plan which provides for overlapping three year performance periods the long term incentive plan which consists of a performance based long term cash bonus and performance units has the following characteristics the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the participants salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition a fixed number of performance units is awarded to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the earned awards are paid out in kroger common shares based on actual performance along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares ultimately earned the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance units earned are each determined based on our performance against the same metrics established by the compensation committee the independent directors for the ceo at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the baseline of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance units awarded the compensation committee anticipates adopting a new long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year periods each year when establishing the performance metric baselines and percentage payouts per unit of improvement the compensation committee considers the difficulty of achieving compounded improvement over time under the long term incentive plan kroger awarded performance units to approximately employees including the neos long term incentive plan metrics and connection to our business strategy metric rationale for use customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four keys of our customer ststrategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric measures the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys long term incentive plan payout is based on all of the elements of the customer st strategy to maintain our top executives consistent focus on the entirety of the customer st strategy this is in contrast to the annual cash bonus payout which is based on certain elements of the customer st strategy to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year improvement in associateengagement kroger measures associate engagement in an annual survey of associates this metric is included in the long term incentive plan as an acknowledgement that our companys success is directly tied to our associates connecting with and serving our customers every day whether in our stores manufacturing plants distribution centers or offices reduction in operatingcosts as a percentage ofsales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way we strive to be disciplined so that as the company grows expenses are properly managed an operating costs metric is included in both the annual cash bonus plan and long term incentive plans operating costs without fuel can be improved temporarily on an annual basis but it is more difficult to maintain these reductions over time it is the role of the approximately employees in the long term incentive plan to continue to reduce operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel over time and to ensure such reductions are sustainable over the long term including this metric in the long term incentive plan incentivizes these key employees to implement policies for sustainable improvement over a long period of time roic part of our long term growth strategy is to make substantial capital investments over time we have a pipeline of high quality projects and new store openings and we continue to increase the square footage in our fill in markets with significant capital spend it is essential that we achieve the proper returns on our investments this measure is intended to hold executives accountable for the returns on the capital investments operating costs is a non gaap measure and is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel operating costs will exclude one time expenses incurred in lieu of future anticipated obligations future expenses that are avoided by virtue of the incurrence of the one time expense will be deemed to be total operating costs in the year in which they otherwise would have been incurred return on invested capital is a non gaap measure and is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our last in first out lifo charge

narrative kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the neos participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of

amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the neos received the following benefits premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance and premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies process for establishing executive compensation the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of our executive officers including the neos with the exception of the ceo the compensation committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those members of the board establish the ceos compensation the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the compensation committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the compensation committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the compensation committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target performance based annual cash bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual cash bonus potential annualized long term compensation such as performance based long term cash bonus potential and performance units stock options and restricted stock and total direct compensation the sum of target annual cash compensation and annualized long term compensation in addition to the factors identified above the consultant also reviews actual payout amounts against the targeted amounts the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded companies selected by the committee for our peer group consisted of best buy home depot target cardinal health johnson johnson tjx companies costco wholesale lowes wal mart cvs health procter gamble walgreens boots alliance express scripts sysco the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant the compensation committee modified the peer group in because of industry consolidation and other competitive forces previously the compensation committee used a primary peer group consisting only of food and drug retailers in addition the compensation committee considered data from general industry companies provided by its independent compensation consultant a representation of major publicly traded companies of similar size and scope from outside the retail industry this data provided reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector the new peer group includes a combination of food and drug retailers other large retailers based on revenue size and large consumer facing companies median revenue for the peer group was billion compared to our revenue of billion considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the compensation committee believes that salaries paid to our neos should be competitively positioned relative to amounts paid by peer group companies for comparable positions the compensation committee also aims to provide an annual cash bonus potential to our neos that if the increasingly more challenging annual business plan objectives are achieved at superior levels would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the baselines established by the compensation committee the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos compensation in setting total compensation the independent directors consider the median compensation of the peer groups ceos with respect to the annual bonus the independent directors make two determinations they determine the annual cash bonus potential that will be multiplied by the annual cash bonus payout percentage earned that is generally applicable to all corporate management including the neos and the independent directors determine the annual cash bonus amount paid to the ceo by retaining discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive under the formulaic plan the compensation committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other neos in its annual review of compensation for the neos the compensation committee conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the neos on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each neo of salary performance based annual cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation stock options restricted stock accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits company paid health and welfare benefits banked vacation severance benefits available under kepp and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the compensation committee has determined that the compensation of the ceo and that of the other neos bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the compensation committees compensation consultant comparing neo and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies including both our peer group of competitors and a larger general industry group to ensure that the compensation committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary annual cash bonus potential and long term compensation awards for each of the senior officers including the other neos the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the compensation committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team the compensation committee does not make use of a formula but rather substantively considers each of the factors identified above in setting compensation advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting we held our sixth annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote in the compensation committee believes it conveys our shareholders support of the compensation committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs as a result the compensation committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs or our pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting in keeping with our shareholders request for an annual advisory vote we will again hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the compensation committee will continue to consider the results from this years and future advisory votes on executive compensation in their evaluation and administration of our compensation program as required at the annual meeting we also are holding an advisory vote on the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation see page stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our officers and directors with your interests as shareholders the board has adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines require non employee directors executive

options and or applicable taxes and must retain all kroger common shares unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo executive compensation recoupment policy clawback if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual cash bonus or a long term cash bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the compensation committee then the officer upon demand from the compensation committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the compensation committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment compensation policies as they relate to risk management as part of the compensation committees review of our compensation practices the compensation committee considers and analyzes the extent to which risks arise from such practices and their impact on krogers business as discussed in this discussion and analysis our policies and practices for compensating employees are designed to among other things attract and retain high quality and engaged employees in this process the compensation committee also focuses on minimizing risk through the implementation of certain practices and policies such as the executive compensation recoupment policy which is described above under executive compensation recoupment policy clawback accordingly we do not believe that our compensation practices and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on kroger prohibition on hedging and pledging after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board has adopted a policy prohibiting kroger directors and executive officers from engaging directly or indirectly in the pledging of hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities section m of the internal revenue code tax laws place a deductibility limit of on some types of compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers other than the chief financial officer reported in this proxy because they are among the four highest compensated officers covered employees in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of neos compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the covered employees is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria which have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the covered employees should be deductible by kroger krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is material and supports krogers compensation philosophy the compensation committee also will attempt to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by kroger

to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas a portion of kroger house brand product packaging is unrecyclable including plastics which are a growing component of marine litter authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life spreads toxics and poses a potential threat to human health the environmental cost of consumer plastic products and packaging exceeds billion annually according to the american chemistry council plastic is the fastest growing form of packaging u s flexible plastic sales are estimated at billion dried fruit frozen meat cheese and dog food are some of the kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches private label items account for a quarter of all sales nearly billion annually using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources william mcdonough a leading green design advisor calls pouch packaging a monstrous hybrid designed to end up either in a landfill or incinerator recyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious yet recycling rates stagnate only of plastic packaging is recycled according to the u s environmental protection agency epa billions of pouches and similar plastic laminates lie buried in landfills unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways an assessment of marine debris by the global environment facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled in the marine environment plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food studies by the epa suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent bio accumulative toxic chemicals plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets if no actions are taken oceans are expected to contain more plastic than fish by making all packaging recyclable if possible is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by plastic pollution better management of plastic could save consumer goods companies billion a year companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging other companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability walmart recently unveiled a sustainable packaging playbook incentivizing it suppliers to increase the amount of packaging they use that can be recycled procter gamble and colgate palmolive have both agreed to make most of their packaging recyclable by resolved shareowners of kroger request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging supporting statement proponents believe that the report should include an assessment of the reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging and if possible goals and a timeline to phase out unrecyclable packaging the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the important role the company plays as a good steward of the environment including thorough efforts to increase plastic recyclability early last year kroger announced a set of sustainability goals one of those goals is dedicated to corporate brand packaging and addressing recyclability issues as stated on our sustainability website sustainability kroger com corporate brands packaging optimization by kroger will optimize packaging in corporate brands by following a balanced multi pronged approach that considers design attributes including but not limited to food safety shelf life availability quality material type and source function recyclability and cost the focus on corporate brand packaging affects both the usage of recyclable goods and the reduction of waste from packaging in the first place an example is the recent redesign of our banner brand gallon milk jug the milk jug still is made of the same recyclable high density polyethylene as the old jugs but the unique design allows us to use approximately less plastic while retaining the same performance when this new jug rolls out across the country it is expected to save more than five million pounds of plastic each year the reduction is equivalent to reducing million recyclable jugsenough when laid on their sides to make a line from new york to los angelesand back another example is to reduce the weight of kroger corporate brand plastic water bottles in the bottle weighed grams and today it weighs grams these initiatives are helping the company meet our stated packaging reduction goals in addition we are increasingly labeling recyclable corporate brand products per the federal trade commissions green guides prompting our customers to please recycle as packaging labels are updated we note all recyclable plastic and paper packaging as such one example is through our redesign of kroger brand milks creams and orange juices that come in quart pint and half pint packages the packaging for these products is comprised of a bottle made from polyethylene terephthalate pete one of the most widely recycled plastics available and a shrink sleeve while the shrink sleeve is also made from pete these shrink sleeves may interfere with the ability of the bottles to be segregated and recycled when a recycling facility uses optical scanning technology as a result in order to increase the number of corporate brand pete bottles that can be properly recycled we have added a tear perforation and the consumer message remove label to recycle bottle to the shrink labels kroger also has a goal to be a zero waste company by part of that is to create diversion opportunities for our associates and our customers this goal extends to our manufacturing plants of which are designated as zero waste and our distribution centers of which are designated as zero waste in through our more than retail locations we have donated over million pounds of food that could not be sold but that are still safe and nutritious to feeding america food banks over retail locations have organic recycling programs for food and flowers that could not be sold or donated we provide in store opportunities for our customers to recycle as well most of our kroger family of stores have recycling drop off locations these recycling bins are part of our plastic bag recycling program and are typically located in the front vestibule of our stores customers can recycle many of their corporate brand plastic packaging including clean and dry plastic bags bread bags bottled water case wraps bathroom tissue and diaper plastic overwraps dry cleaning bags and newspaper bags associates also use this program to recycle pallet shrink wrap in we recycled nearly million lbs of plastic from these receptacles alone guided by our sustainability goals our efforts and goals will continue to support plastic waste reduction find optimized solutions for packaging and create increasing opportunities for customers to recycle plastics in our stores we will continue to optimize our corporate brand packaging in ways that support our financial environmental and social responsibilities to our customers shareholders and other stakeholders we urge you to support these efforts and vote against this proposal itemno shareholder proposalrenewable energy we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas to mitigate the worst impacts

limit kroger is the rd largest global retailer exceeding billion in revenue it is listed th on fortunes fortune list and nd on fortunes global list despite its size and significant carbon impact kroger lags its peers in establishing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets where most companies are reducing carbon krogers combined scope emissions have increased every year since kroger cdp reports investors are concerned that krogers globally significant carbon emissions are not being adequately addressed one meaningful way kroger could reduce its carbon footprint is to expand its use of renewable energy while making some inroads on energy and supply chain efficiency kroger has not instituted programs to reduce the carbon impact of its powering sourcing krogers failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy is in strong contrast to its peers which are rapidly and profitably scaling renewable energy competitor walmart installed me of solar at different sites target

schmidt executive chairman of alphabet inc much of corporate america is buying renewable energy not just to be sustainable because it makes business sense helping companies diversify their power supply hedge against fuel risks and support innovation in an increasingly cost competitive way google green blog accelerating renewable energy adoption will help kroger stay competitive and protect krogers shareholder value into the future as intensifying climate change imposes growing costs on krogers supply chain physical assets and shareholders be it resolved shareholders request kroger produce a report assessing the climate change risk reduction benefits of adopting quantitative enterprise wide targets for increasing its renewable energy sourcing the report should be produced at reasonable cost and exclude proprietary information supporting statement shareholders request the report also include discussion of the business risk kroger faces from climate change the potential for renewable energy procurement to reduce such risk and options for increasing renewable energy adoption the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger is committed to environmental sustainability and we strive to reduce our impact on the environment by addressing many aspects of our business that reduce carbon emissions we assert that the concerns of the proponent are addressed by a number of initiatives included in our sustainability goals kroger has a history of reducing carbon emissions across our footprint nearly years ago we set a goal which we achieved to aggressively reduce energy consumption and refrigerant leaks improve transportation efficiency and create renewable energy from food waste these targeted efforts among others have resulted in a nearly intensity reduction co e ft since even as our company has grown in sales and square footage we are actively working to do more in both the short and long term for example our turkey hill dairy has two wind energy turbines with megawatt capacity since these turbines have supplied up to of the dairys annual electricity needs which is enough power to produce six million gallons of ice cream and million gallons of iced tea in addition ten kroger stores have approximately kw of solar energy capacity that annually produces approximately million kwh the kroger recovery system located in compton ca at the ralphs food less distribution center has been in operation since late it utilizes anaerobic digestion a naturally occurring process to transform food waste into renewable biogas this system annually processes approximately tons of food waste annually this biogas is then turned into power for onsite operations the system provides approximately million kwh of renewable energy for the square foot ralphs food less distribution center the system reduces area truck trips by more than miles each year and reduces waste costs these efforts are estimated to reduce carbon emissions by tons per year early last year kroger announced a set of sustainability goals kroger has several specific goals to address carbon emission reduction across the enterprise including kroger will reduce cumulative energy consumption by by using as a baseline year kroger will build on our long term success of energy consumption reduction through the maintenance of existing processes and technologies as well as testing and learning from new technologies kroger will improve transportation efficiency by by using as a baseline year we will track our ton miles per gallon tmpg effectively looking at how many miles we haul one ton of groceries on one gallon of fuel kroger will reduce refrigerant leaks in our supermarket refrigeration systems kroger will reduce refrigerant leaks by to the epas greenchill program year kroger will be a zero waste company by as defined by epa or more of waste diverted away from landfills as a food manufacturer and retailer the reduction of food waste is a key component to meet this goal its also a key component of our scope emissions we have many programs in place to divert as much food as possible away from landfills to higher better uses for each of the past several years we have published online our annual sustainability report that highlights many of our sustainability initiatives krogers sustainability goals can also be found at sustainability kroger com finally as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability we are in the midst of conducting an analysis to develop a comprehensive carbon reduction plan that includes renewables we created a cross functional team to help determine how we can best achieve meaningful reductions in a way that supports our financial environmental and social responsibilities to our customers shareholders and other stakeholders we urge you to support the furthering of our current programs and vote against this proposal itemno shareholder proposaldeforestation we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas the kroger co kroger utilizes beef soy palm oil and pulp paper in its business these commodities are among the leading drivers of deforestation globally krogers limited action on deforestation exposes the company to significant business risks including supply chain reliability damage to its brand value and failure to meet shifting consumer and market expectations deforestation accounts for over of global greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to biodiversity loss soil erosion disrupted rainfall patterns community land conflicts and forced labor commercial agriculture accounted for over of tropical deforestation between and half of which was illegal supply chain sources that are illegally engaged in deforestation are vulnerable to interruption as enforcement increases conserving forests by increasing agricultural productivity and the use of already cleared land will stabilize soils and climate while regulating regional water flows companies that have failed to mitigate the impacts of their supply chain have faced reputational damage and consumer rejection of their products consumers are increasingly demanding that businesses become more responsible and transparent a whitepaper by technomic a leading food industry consultancy stated in many cases they are rewarding those they perceive to be good environmental stewards and corporate citizens kroger scored out of in the forest company scorecard and a out of on ucss cattle scorecard in contrast companies such as mcdonalds unilever and nestl have committed to eliminate deforestation in their global supply chains further kroger has yet to join its peers in signing the new york declaration on forests to help meet the private sector goal of eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities by kroger asserts that it has begun addressing deforestation in its palm oil supply chains as well as in other high risk commodities supply chains the companys sustainability report notes a policy to address high impact commodities that have potentially sensitive social environmental and or economic impacts because of where they are harvested produced or processed however kroger has no commitment to providing investors with detailed metrics on key issues such as deforestation that can aid in assessing the effectiveness of the policies on achieving sustainability and long term value resolved shareholders request that kroger issue reports to investors at reasonable expense and excluding proprietary information providing quantitative metrics on supply chain impacts on deforestation including progress on time bound goals for reducing such impacts supporting statement proponents believe meaningful indicators in such reports could include for key commodities that kroger sources such as soy beef and pulp paper the percentage that can be traced back to its source and the percentage verified via credible third parties as not contributing to physical expansion into peatlands hcv or hcs forests tracking these figures against an anticipated timeframe for sourcing consistent with those criteria and an assessment of reputational and operational risks facing kroger in relation to supply chain and operational impacts on deforestation the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding deforestation associated with palm oil beef soy and paper pulp used to produce corporate brands kroger engages in many industry groups and credible third parties such as the world wildlife fund the consumer goods forum rainforest alliance and the sustainability consortium to address the responsible sourcing of commodities that have the potential for greater social environmental or economic impacts due to where and how they are produced or processed kroger is constantly evaluating the areas where we can effect changes in our supply chain and create a positive impact on the drivers of deforestation here are a few examples of the goals and metrics that we utilize in managing our supply chain palm oil in kroger announced a goal for our corporate brands to source only certified sustainable palm oil cspo per the principles criteria and standards set by the roundtable on sustainable palm oil in kroger met this goal by sourcing only cspo from a mass balance supply chain one of the top third party certified methodologies supported by the roundtable for sustainable palm oil such rigorous verification systems help ensure that consumers use certifiably sustainable palm oil we continue to monitor and maintain the integrity of this important commitment paper and pulp in kroger was the first recipient of the rainforest alliances supply chain partnership award this was in recognition of our homesense tissue products line which is the largest u s corporate brand tissue product that is forest stewardship council certified by the rainforest alliance beef kroger corporate brand beef products are sourced primarily from the usa we also carry several products from uruguay where ranchers are subject to land management requirements and government audits to ensure sustainable agricultural practices kroger with the help of our suppliers can trace each step from live animal source to finished product soy kroger corporate brands containing soy are sourced exclusively from the usa kroger is a board member of the consumer goods forum cgf a leading global body of retailers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers the cgf is a signatory to the new york declaration on forests and has pledged to eliminate deforestation from consumer goods supply chains by and called for a legally binding climate agreement our position on these commodities is consistent with the position advocated by the cgfs zero net deforestation by resolution furthermore in kroger partnered with the sustainability consortium tsc to identify assess and further understand social and environmental risks in our supply chain the tsc has a robust set of key performance indicators such as deforestation child labor forced labor and water scarcity as we have done throughout the years we will use this information to find additional ways to minimize our impact on deforestation these efforts and goals will continue to minimize the risks associated with commodity related deforestation in our supply chain we urge you to support these efforts and vote against this proposal itemno shareholder proposalindependent chairman we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting resolved shareowners of the kroger co kroger request the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent member of the board this independence policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation the policy should provide that i if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the policy within days of that determination and ii compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair supporting statement except for brief apprenticeship periods at the outset of their ceo service kroger ceos have also held the role of board chair for many decades we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporations governance which can harm shareholder value as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and support strong board leadership an independent board chair has been found in academic studies to improve the performance of public companies a report by governance firm gmi found that the ceo chair combination is statistically associated with an elevated risk of enforcement action for accounting fraud gmi analyst esg and accounting metrics for investment use march while separating the roles of chair and ceo is the norm in europe of russell companies have also implemented this best practice ey center for board matters december available at http www ey com gl en issues governance and reporting ey corporate governance by the numbers boardleadership we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons krogers board is structured to provide the most effective leadership for our shareholders our shareholders interests are best served when the company retains the flexibility to select the appropriate person to serve in the chairmans role given the changing circumstances of the retail food marketplace the board believes that the proponents rigid one size fits all proposal which fails to identify any concerns specific to kroger is not in the best interest of shareholders and should be rejected kroger has a balanced governance structure in which independent directors including an independent lead director exercise meaningful and vigorous oversight krogers board is led by a strong independent lead director who serves the same functions as a chairman and provides the safeguards that the proposal seeks the lead directors robust duties and responsibilities are addressed in detail in the guidelines which are available at ir kroger com the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving all board meeting agendas meeting materials and schedule serving as a liaison between the chairman and the independent directors presiding at the regularly conducted executive sessions of independent directors and meetings of the board when the chairman is not present calling an executive session of the independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication if requested by major shareholders while our current chairman is also the ceo this structure is a reflection of the boards current view that both kroger and our shareholders would not be best served by separation the roles at this time given the important skills and industry expertise that our ceo brings to the board however the board routinely reviews krogers leadership structure which includes a discussion of krogers performance the impact that the leadership has on that performance and the structure that best serves the interests of shareholders the board has instituted structures and practices in addition to the independent lead director that create a balanced governance system of independent oversight including all of krogers board members are independent except for one all members including chairpersons of each of the board committees are independent the full board of independent directors annually evaluate the ceos performance and the board and each of its committees have unfettered access to management and the authority to retain independent advisors as they deem appropriate contrary to the assertions in the proponents supporting statement there is no established consensus that separating the roles of the chairman and the ceo is a best practice or that such a separation enhances returns for shareholders the authors of a wharton school of business article entitled splitting up the roles of ceo and chairman reform or red herring http knowledge wharton upenn edu article cfm articleid concluded that there is no evidence that separating the positions of chairman and ceo improves corporate performance in corporate governance update analyzing aspects of board composition david a katz and laura a mcintosh new york law journal january the authors concluded that from a board effectiveness perspective there is no need to separate the roles of chairman and ceo so long as there is an effective lead director in place in addition the majority of u s companies have not implemented the structure recommended by the proposal the board will continue to review krogers leadership structure to ensure that the structure best addresses krogers evolving and dynamic business in consultation with the current board and our shareholders the board believes that eliminating the flexibility to determine which type of leadership structure is not in our shareholders best interests for the foregoing reasons we urge you to vote against this proposal shareholder proposals and director nominations annual meeting pursuant to rule a under the securities exchange act of as
