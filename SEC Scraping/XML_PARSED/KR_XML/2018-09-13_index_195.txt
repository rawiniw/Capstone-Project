second quarter compared to a million lifo charge in the same quarter last year operating general administrative costs as a rate of sales excluding fuel increased basis points driven entirely by higher expense for incentive plans as compared to last year rent and depreciation excluding fuel decreased by basis points fifo operating margin on a rolling four quarters basis decreased basis points compared to the prior year excluding fuel mergers the rdweek and the adjustment items from the respective periods kroger did not adjust the rates as a percent of sales described above for the divestiture of the convenience store business and the merger with home chef because the effect was insignificant financial strategy krogers financial strategy is to use its free cash flow to drive
