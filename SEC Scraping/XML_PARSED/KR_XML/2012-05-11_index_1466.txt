in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the committee nor the board expressly approved the other services the committee determined that the consultant is independent because a he was first engaged by the committee before he became associated with mercer b he works exclusively for the committee and not for our management c he does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and d neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services on behalf of kroger board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board of directors is responsible for the overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the boards audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control that exposure the audit committee also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management including krogers chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective committees regarding the management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board in addition to the reports from the committees the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo address matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by an independent lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr dillon as chairman and ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls board leadership structure our board is composed of twelve independent directors and two management directors mr dillon the chairman of the board and chief executive officer and mr mcmullen president and chief operating officer in addition as provided in our guidelines on issues of corporate governance the board has designated one of the independent directors as lead director the board has established five standing committees audit compensation corporate governance financial policy and public responsibilities each of the board committees is composed solely of independent directors each with a different independent director serving as committee chair we believe that the mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our board along with the independent role of our lead director and our independent board committees benefits kroger and its shareholders the board believes that it is beneficial to kroger and its shareholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving board agendas meeting materials and schedules to confirm the appropriate topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each serving as liaison between the chairman of the board management and the non management directors presiding at the executive sessions of independent directors and at all other meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present and calling an executive session of independent directors at any time bobby shackouls an independent director and the chair of the corporate governance committee is currently our lead director mr shackouls is an effective lead director for kroger due to among other things his independence his deep strategic and operational understanding of kroger obtained while serving as a kroger director his corporate governance knowledge acquired during his tenure as a member of our corporate governance committee his previous experience on other boards and his prior experience as a ceo of a fortune company with respect to the roles of chairman and ceo the guidelines provide that the board believes that it is in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders for one person to serve as chairman and ceo the board recognizes that there may be circumstances in which it is in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders for the roles to be separated and the board exercises its discretion as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances the board believes that the combination or separation of these positions should continue to be considered as part of the succession planning process as was the case in when the roles were separated since the roles have been combined our board and each of its committees conduct an annual evaluation to determine whether they are functioning effectively as part of this annual self evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders our guidelines provide the flexibility for our board to modify our leadership structure in the future as appropriate we believe that kroger like many u s companies has been well served by this flexible leadership structure compensation discussion and analysis executive compensation overview as the largest traditional food and drug retailer in the united states our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals our strategy is designed to create value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our focus on our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives our compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance using the following guiding principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance with both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that align with our business strategy our fiscal year results compared against the compensation of senior executives demonstrated these principles and illustrated how our compensation program responds to business challenges and the marketplace while many companies have struggled unsuccessfully during this difficult economy we have continued to deliver sales growth and positive earnings results our identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased compared to this result was substantially better than most of our competitors sales growth and exceeded our objectives our earnings per diluted share were excluding the effect of the ufcw pension plan consolidation charge these results during the challenging operating environment of also exceeded our objectives annual cash dividends declared per common share during the year increased over as described below short term performance based compensation or annual cash bonus of of bonus potentials paid to the named executive officers exceeded both the average of over the prior nine years and the paid in this reflects the extent to which kroger was able to exceed increasingly more challenging targets for sales earnings our strategic plan and our fuel program as well as year over year improvement from beginning in fifty percent of the time based equity awards that otherwise would have been granted to the named executive officers as restricted stock have been replaced with performance units that are earned only to the extent that performance objectives are achieved equity compensation awards continued to play an important role in rewarding named executive officers for the achievement of long term business objectives and providing incentives for the creation of shareholder value in sum the committee believes our management produced outstanding results in exceeding our aggressive business plan objectives for sales earnings and our strategic plan the compensation paid to our named executive officers reflected this fact as the performance based cash bonus paid out at of bonus potentials further the equity based portion of compensation the value of which is tied to the return received by our shareholders in the stock market grew in value by during this is shown in the performance graph appearing at page a of the accompanying annual report in keeping with our overall compensation philosophy we endeavor to ensure that our compensation practices conform to best practices when identified in particular over the past several years we have put in place significant stock ownership guideline levels to reinforce the link between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders adopted claw back policies under which the repayment of bonuses may be required in certain circumstances eliminated tax gross ups and adopted the recommendation of shareholders that they be permitted annually on an advisory basis to vote on executive compensation the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of krogers executive officers including the named executive officers with the exception of the chief executive officer the committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those independent board members establish the ceos compensation the following discussion and analysis addresses the compensation of the named executive officers and the factors considered by the committee in setting compensation for the named executive officers and making recommendations to the independent board members in the case of the ceos compensation additional detail is provided in the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosures that follow this discussion and analysis executive compensationobjectives the committee has several related objectives regarding compensation first the committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that executive officers play at kroger second some elements of compensation should help align the interests of the officers with your interests as shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers a to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and b to ensure that the officers achieve krogers long term strategic objectives in developing compensation programs and amounts to meet these objectives the committee exercises judgment to ensure that executive officer compensation is appropriate and competitive in light of krogers performance and the needs of the business to meet these objectives the committee has taken a number of steps over the last several years including the following consulted regularly with its independent advisor from mercer human resource consulting on the design of compensation plans and on the amount of compensation that is necessary and appropriate for krogers senior leaders in light of the committees objectives from time to time and most recently in the committee retains a second independent consultant to determine whether the compensation plans and amounts comport with the committees objectives and produce value for krogers shareholders conducted an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the named executive officers on tally sheets the review includes an assessment for each named executive officer including the ceo of salary performance based cash compensation or bonus both annual and long term equity accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits severance benefits available under the kroger co employee protection plan and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considered internal pay equity at kroger the committee is aware of reported concerns at other companies regarding disproportionate compensation awards to chief executive officers the committee has assured itself that the compensation of krogers ceo and that of the other named executive officers bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities recommended share ownership guidelines adopted by the board of directors these guidelines require directors officers and some other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger shares the guidelines require the ceo to acquire and maintain ownership of kroger shares equal to times his base salary the chief operating officer at times his base salary executive vice presidents senior vice presidents and non employee directors at times their base salaries or annual base cash retainers and other officers and key executives at times their base salaries results of advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting of shareholders we held our first advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of this advisory proposal the committee considered this favorable outcome and believed it conveyed our shareholders support of the committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs as a result the committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs or pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting of shareholders as requested by the shareholders we will again hold an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the committee will continue to consider the results from this years and future advisory votes on executive compensation establishing executive compensation the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos salary the bonus potential for the ceo the nature and amount of any equity awards made to the ceo and any other compensation questions related to the ceo in setting the annual bonus potential for the ceo the independent directors determine the dollar amount that will be multiplied by the percentage payout under the annual bonus plan generally applicable to all corporate management including the named executive officers the independent directors retain discretion to reduce the percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive the independent directors thus make a separate determination annually concerning both the ceos bonus potential and the percentage of bonus paid the committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other named executive officers the committees annual review of compensation for the named executive officers includes the following a detailed report by officer that describes current compensation the value of equity compensation previously awarded the value of retirement benefits earned and any severance or other benefits payable upon a change of control an internal equity comparison of compensation at various senior levels this current and historical analysis is undertaken to ensure that the relationship of ceo compensation to other senior officer compensation and senior officer compensation to other levels in the organization is equitable a report from the committees compensation consultants described below comparing named executive officer and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies primarily our competitors to ensure that the committees objectives of competitiveness are met a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary bonus potential and equity awards for each of the senior officers including the other named executive officers the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team historical information regarding salary bonus and equity compensation for a year period in considering each of the factors above the committee does not make use of a formula but rather subjectively reviews each in making its compensation determination the committees compensation consultants and benchmarking as referenced earlier in this proxy statement the committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target annual performance based bonus target cash compensation the sum of salary and bonus annualized long term incentive awards such as stock options restricted shares and performance based long term cash bonuses and performance based equity awards and total direct compensation the sum of all these elements the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded food and drug retailers for the group consisted of costco wholesale supervalu cvs caremark target rite aid wal mart safeway walgreens this peer group is the same group as was used in with the exception that great atlantic pacific tea was eliminated in due to its bankruptcy the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant industry consolidation and other competitive forces will change the peer group used over time the consultant also provides the committee data from companies in general industry a representation of major publicly traded companies these data are reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector in the committee directly engaged an additional compensation consultant to conduct a review of krogers executive compensation this consultant from frederic w cook co inc examined the compensation philosophy peer group composition annual cash bonus and long term incentive compensation including equity awards the consultant concluded that krogers executive compensation program met the committees objectives and that it provides a strong linkage between pay and performance the committee expects to engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable kroger is the second largest company as measured by annual revenues when compared with the peer group referenced above and is the largest traditional food and drug retailer the committee has therefore sought to ensure that salaries paid to our executive officers are at or above the median paid by competitors for comparable positions and to provide an annual bonus potential to our executive officers that if annual business plan objectives are achieved would cause their total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our named executive officers is comprised of the following salary performance based annual cash bonus annual non equity incentive pay performance based long term cash bonus long term non equity incentive pay equity including performance based equity retirement and other benefits and perquisites salary we provide our named executive officers and other employees a fixed amount of cash compensation salary for their work salaries for named executive officers with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the committee the ceos salary is established by the independent directors salaries for the named executive officers were reviewed in june the amount of each executives salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the committee or in the case of the ceo of the committee and the rest of the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure and relationship with the salaries of other executives at kroger the assessment of individual contribution is based on a subjective determination without the use of performance targets in the following areas leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the amounts shown below reflect the salaries of the named executive officers in effect following the annual review of their compensation in june of each year salaries david b dillon j michael schlotman w rodney mcmullen paul w heldman michael j donnelly mr donnelly became a named executive officer in the salary amount shown reflects his annualized salary as of the date he became a named executive officer performance based annual cash bonus a large percentage of our employees at all levels including the named executive officers are eligible to receive a performance based annual cash bonus based on kroger or unit performance the committee establishes bonus potentials for each executive officer other than the ceo whose bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts which can exceed of the potential amounts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the thresholds established by the committee the committee considers several factors in making its determination or recommendation as to bonus potentials first the individuals level within the organization is a factor in that the committee believes that more senior executives should have a substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance second the individuals salary is a factor so that a substantial portion of a named executive officers total cash compensation is dependent upon krogers performance finally the committee considers the reports of its compensation consultants to assess the bonus potential of the named executive officers in light of total compensation paid to comparable executive positions in the industry the annual cash bonus potential in effect at the end of the year for each named executive officer is shown below actual bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual bonus potential david b dillon j michael schlotman w rodney mcmullen paul w heldman michael j donnelly mr donnelly became a named executive officer in the amount of bonus that the named executive officers earn each year is determined by krogers performance compared to targets established by the committee based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors in thirty percent of bonus was earned based on an identical sales target for krogers supermarkets and other business operations thirty percent was based on a target for ebitda excluding supermarket fuel and forty percent was based on implementation and results of a set of measures under our strategic plan an additional would be earned if kroger achieved three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations achievement of the targeted fuel ebitda as set forth in the business plan increase of at least in gallons sold at identical fuel centers and achievement of the planned number of fuel centers placed in service over time the committee has placed an increased emphasis on the strategic plan by making the target more difficult to achieve the bonus plan allows for minimal bonus to be earned at relatively low levels to provide incentive for achieving even higher levels of performance following the close of the year the committee reviewed krogers performance against the identical sales ebitda and strategic plan objectives and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives krogers ebitda for was billion and krogers identical retail sales for excluding supermarket fuel were in krogers supermarket fuel ebitda was million which exceeded the goal of million necessary to earn a bonus for the fuel component krogers sale of fuel in identical supermarket fuel centers was billion gallons or over the prior year we operated supermarket fuel centers as of the end of exceeding our goal of centers as a result the officers earned the additional fuel bonus due to the companys excellent performance when compared to the targets established by the committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors the named executive officers earned of their bonus potentials which percentage payout exceeded that of last year and the average bonus payout over the previous several years this reflects krogers outstanding performance in exceeding its aggressive ebitda sales and strategic plan goals the targets established by the committee for annual bonus amounts based on identical sales and ebitda results the actual results and the bonus percentage earned in each of the components of named executive officer bonus were as follows targets component minimum result amount earned identical sales ebitda billion billion billion strategic plan fuel bonus as described in the text above payout is at if identical sales goal is achieved the strategic plan component also was established by the committee but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive in as in all years the committee retained discretion to reduce the bonus payout for all executive officers including the named executive officers if the committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus those bodies also retained discretion to adjust the targets under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year no adjustments were made to the targets the committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo determined that the bonus payouts for the named executive officers should remain the same as other participants the percentage paid for represented and resulted from performance that significantly exceeded our business plan objectives a comparison of bonus percentages for the named executive officers in prior years demonstrates the variability of incentive compensation annual cash bonus fiscal year percentage the actual amounts of annual performance based cash bonuses paid to the named executive officers for are shown in the summary compensation table under the heading non equity incentive plan compensation these amounts represent the bonus potentials for each named executive officer multiplied by the percentage earned in in no event can any participant receive a performance based annual cash bonus in excess of the maximum amount that a participant including each named executive officer can earn is further limited to of the participants potential amount the performance based annual cash bonus for will be determined based on krogers performance against the identical sales ebitda and strategic plan objectives established by the committee each of these metrics will be weighted the same to indicate to the organization the equal importance that each measure has to krogers overall strategy the underlying strategy metrics have been revised from prior years to focus on shorter term measures as the long term bonus emphasizes long term performance the plan also provides for an additional payout if our goals for supermarket fuel ebitda supermarket fuel sales and targeted number of fuel centers in operation at the fiscal year end are achieved performance based long term bonus the committee continues to believe in the importance of providing an incentive to the named executive officers to achieve the long term goals established by the board of directors by conditioning a portion of compensation on the achievement of those goals approximately kroger executives including the named executive officers are eligible to participate in a performance based cash bonus plan designed to reward participants for improving the long term performance of kroger bonuses are earned based on the extent to which kroger advances its strategic plan the committee adopted a long term bonus plan under which cash bonuses were earned based on the extent to which kroger advanced its strategic plan by improving its performance in four key categories based on results of customer surveys reducing total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and improving its performance in eleven key attributes designed to measure associate satisfaction and one key attribute designed to measure how krogers focus on its values supports how employees do business based on the results of associate surveys the plan measured improvements through fiscal year participants received a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increased a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures the committee administers the plan and determined the bonus payout amounts based on achievement of the performance criteria except in the case of the ceo for whom the independent directors make the determination total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were and at the end of fiscal year were combining this operating cost improvement with our performance in our key categories and our key attributes of associate satisfaction resulted in payouts of of the participants annual salary in effect at the end of fiscal year in no event can any participant receive a performance based long term cash bonus in excess of the committee adopted a long term plan in which measures improvements through fiscal year participants receive a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increases a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were cash bonus payouts are based on the degree to which improvements are achieved and will be awarded based on the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in no event can any participant receive a performance based long term cash bonus in excess of the lesser of and the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in addition to a cash bonus under the plan participants also receive performance units more particularly described under equity below the committee also adopted a long term plan in which measures improvements through fiscal year participants receive a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increases a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were cash bonus payouts are based on the degree to which improvements are achieved and will be awarded based on the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in no event can any participant receive a performance based long term cash bonus in excess of the lesser of and the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in addition to a cash bonus under the plan participants also receive performance units more particularly described under equity below the committee adopted a new long term plan in which measures improvements through fiscal year participants receive a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increases a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were cash bonus payouts are based on the degree to which improvements are achieved and will be awarded based on the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in no event can any participant receive a performance based long term cash bonus in excess of the lesser of and the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in addition to a cash bonus under the plan participants also receive performance units more particularly described under equity below in adopting new long term plans the committee has made adjustments to the percentage payouts for the components of the long term plans to account for the increasing difficulty of achieving compounded improvement the committee anticipates adopting a new plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year periods equity awards based on krogers common shares are granted periodically to the named executive officers and a large number of other employees equity participation aligns the interests of employees with your interest as shareholders and kroger historically has distributed equity awards widely in kroger granted stock options to approximately employees including the named executive officers under one of krogers long term incentive plans the options permit the holder to purchase kroger common shares at an option price equal to the closing price of kroger common shares on the date of the grant the committee adopted a policy of granting options only at one of the four committee meetings conducted within a week following krogers public release of its quarterly earnings results krogers long term incentive plans also provide for other equity based awards including restricted stock during kroger awarded shares of restricted stock to approximately employees including the named executive officers this amount is comparable to amounts awarded over the past few years as we began reducing the number of stock options granted and increasing the number of shares of restricted stock awards the change in krogers broad based equity program from predominantly stock options to a mixture of options and restricted shares was precipitated by a the perception of increased value that restricted shares offer b the retention benefit to kroger of restricted shares and c changes in accounting conventions that permitted the change without added cost beginning in as a part of the long term plan the committee also awarded performance units to the same individuals that receive the long term performance based cash bonus described in the previous section performance units are earned based on performance over a three year period on metrics established by the committee at the beginning of the performance period during kroger awarded performance units to employees including the named executive officers the number of shares of restricted stock that participants otherwise would have received was reduced by in order to make a larger share of the participants equity compensation be tied to kroger performance under the plan participants receive a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increases a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were actual payouts are based on the degree to which improvements are achieved will be earned in kroger common shares and cannot exceed of the number of performance units awarded in addition to shares earned under performance units participants receive a cash payment equal to the cash dividends that would have been earned on that number of shares had the participant owned the shares during the performance period the committee considers several factors in determining the amount of options restricted shares and performance units awarded to the named executive officers or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding equity based and other long term compensation awarded by our competitors the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of equity based awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all named executive officers other than in the case of the ceo the committee has long recognized that the amount of compensation provided to the named executive officers through equity based pay is often below the amount paid by our competitors lower equity based awards for the named executive officers and other senior management permit a broader base of kroger employees to participate in equity awards amounts of equity awards issued and outstanding for the named executive officers are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis retirement and other benefits kroger maintains a defined benefit and several defined contribution retirement plans for its employees the named executive officers participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding retirement benefits available to the named executive officers can be found in the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative description that follows this discussion and analysis kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the named executive officers participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year compensation deferred bears interest until paid out at the rate representing krogers cost of ten year debt in the year the rate is set as determined by krogers ceo prior to the beginning of each deferral year in that rate was deferred amounts are paid out only in cash in accordance with a deferral option selected by the participant at the time the deferral election is made we adopted the kroger co employee protection plan or kepp during fiscal year that plan was amended and restated in all of our management employees and administrative support personnel whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service are covered kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described in the plan when an employee is actually or constructively terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of kroger as defined in the plan participants are entitled to severance pay of up to months salary and bonus the actual amount is dependent upon pay level and years of service kepp can be amended or terminated by the board at any time prior to a change in control stock option and restricted stock agreements with participants in krogers long term incentive plans provide that those awards vest with options becoming immediately exercisable and restrictions on restricted stock lapsing upon a change in control as described in the agreements none of the named executive officers is party to an employment agreement perquisites the committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide the named executive officers a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the only perquisites available to our named executive officers were premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies and an achievement award in addition in connection with mr donnellys relocation to cincinnati to become an executive officer he received relocation assistance under krogers relocation policy and forgiveness of a loan pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of that loan could not be maintained to an executive officer the life insurance benefit was offered beginning several years ago to replace a split dollar life insurance benefit that was substantially more costly to kroger currently active executives including the named executive officers and retired executives receive this benefit in addition the named executive officers are entitled to the following benefit that does not constitute a perk as defined by sec rules personal use of kroger aircraft which officers may lease from kroger and pay the average variable cost of operating the aircraft making officers more available and allowing for a more efficient use of their time the total amount of perquisites furnished to the named executive officers is shown in the summary compensation table and described in more detail in footnote to that table executive compensation recoupment policy if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual bonus or a long term bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the committee then the officer upon demand from the committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment section m of the internal revenue code tax laws place a limit of on the amount of some types of compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers reported in this proxy by virtue of being among the four highest compensated officers covered employees that is tax deductible by kroger compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the covered employees is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria and have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the covered employees will be deductible by kroger in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of named executive officers krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is material and supports krogers compensation philosophy the committee also will attempt to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by kroger

as opposed to time based as half of the compensation previously awarded to the named executive officers as restricted stock and earned based on the passage of time is now only earned to the extent that performance goals are achieved in addition annual and long term cash bonuses are performance based and earned only to the extent that performance goals are achieved in tying a large portion of executive compensation to achievement of short term and long term strategic and operational goals we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders the vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation rather the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement the vote is advisory this means that the vote is not binding on kroger the compensation committee of our board of directors is responsible for establishing executive compensation in so doing that committee will consider along with all other relevant factors the results of this vote the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and represented in person or by proxy is required to approve this proposal broker non votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this vote we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution resolved that the compensation paid to the companys named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to item of regulation s k including compensation discussion and analysis compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby approved the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal selection of auditors item no the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for the appointment compensation and retention of krogers independent auditor as required by law and by applicable nyse rules on march the audit committee appointed pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor for the fiscal year ending february while shareholder ratification of the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor is not required by krogers regulations or otherwise the board of directors is submitting the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp to shareholders for ratification as it has in past years as a good corporate governance practice if the shareholders fail to ratify the selection the audit committee may but is not required to reconsider whether to retain that firm even if the selection is ratified the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders a representative of pricewaterhousecoopers llp is expected to be present at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal disclosure of auditor fees the following describes the fees billed to kroger by pricewaterhousecoopers llp related to the fiscal years ended january and january fiscal year fiscal year audit fees audit related fees tax fees all other fees total audit fees for the years ended january and january respectively were for professional services rendered for the audits of krogers consolidated financial statements the issuance of comfort letters to underwriters consents and assistance with the review of documents filed with the sec audit related fees we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for any audit related services for the years ended january and january tax fees for the year ended january were for an analysis of sales tax and tax fees for the year ended january were for an analysis of krogers contribution of inventory to non profit entities all other fees we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for other services for the years ended january and january the audit committee requires that it approve in advance all audit and non audit work performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp on march the audit committee approved services to be performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp for the remainder of fiscal year that are related to the audit of kroger or involve the audit itself in the audit committee adopted an audit and non audit service pre approval policy pursuant to the terms of that policy the committee will annually pre approve certain defined services that are expected to be provided by the independent auditors if it becomes appropriate during the year to engage the independent accountant for additional services the audit committee must first approve the specific services before the independent accountant may perform the additional work pricewaterhousecoopers llp has advised the audit committee that neither the firm nor any member of the firm has any financial interest direct or indirect in any capacity in kroger or its subsidiaries shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by six shareholders the names and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at krogers executive offices that they intend to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting kroger company human rights standards whereas we believe kroger purchases significant amounts of produce such as tomatoes and whereas the united states department of justice has successfully prosecuted several cases of modern day slavery in the u s agricultural industry since involving over workers see for example us v ramos us v lee us v flores us v cuello u s v navarrete and there are additional modern day slavery cases involving agricultural workers in the u s currently under federal prosecution see for example us v bontemps us v global horizons and whereas there is increasing public awareness and media coverage of modern day slavery sweatshop conditions and abuses that many agricultural workers face and whereas we believe violations of human rights in krogers supply chain can lead to negative publicity public protests and a loss of consumer confidence that can have a negative impact on shareholder value and whereas krogers current vendor code of conduct is based heavily on compliance with the law and u s agricultural workers are excluded from many labor laws that apply to other u s workers for example national labor relations act of u s c et seq portions of the fair labor standards act of u s c and whereas other multi national corporations including other large produce purchasers have implemented enforceable and meaningful codes of conduct for their supply chains based on international human rights standards such as the international labor organizations ilo standards and whereas in our opinion as shareholders enforceable human rights codes of conduct based on the ilos declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and other conventions and are essential if consumer and investor confidence in our companys commitment to human rights is to be maintained therefore be it resolved that the shareholders urge the board of directors to adopt implement and enforce a revised company wide code of conduct inclusive of suppliers and sub contractors based on the international labor organizations ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and the following other relevant ilo conventions employment shall be freely chosen there shall be no use of forced labor including bonded or voluntary prison labor ilo conventions and workers are entitled to overtime pay when working more than hours per day ilo convention all workers have the right to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively ilo conventions worker representatives shall not be the subject of discrimination and shall have access to all workplaces necessary to enable them to carry out their representation functions ilo convention the board should also prepare a report at reasonable cost to shareholders and the public concerning the implementation and enforcement of this policy the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the importance of ensuring basic human rights are recognized by those seeking to do business with us as such kroger has in place a comprehensive code of conduct that is applicable to those that furnish goods or services to us as well as their contractors that code of conduct has been published and is available on our website at www kroger com while krogers code of conduct for vendors covers the issues addressed by the proposal it is substantially more comprehensive our existing code of conduct requires compliance with all applicable labor laws regulations and orders including the fair labor standards act in addition the code of conduct prohibits child indentured involuntary or prison labor prohibits exposing workers to unreasonably hazardous unsafe or unhealthy conditions prohibits unlawful discrimination requires the workplace to be free from harassment requires workers to be treated fairly with dignity and respect requires that wages meet or exceed legal and industry standards requires that u s workers be eligible for employment in the u s prohibits bribes and conduct that appears improper or may result in a conflict of interest requires compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act and requires maintenance of records that must be furnished to us upon request evidencing compliance with the code the proponents request that kroger adopt a revised code of conduct applicable to all suppliers and contractors that provides for the following employment is to be freely chosen without the use of forced labor workers are entitled to overtime pay when working more than eight hours per day workers have a right to form and join unions and to collectively bargain and worker representatives are to be free from discrimination and have access to the workplace kroger has developed its own code of conduct that not only deals with the basic tenets of the shareholder proposal but also requires those that do business with us to respect their workers basic human rights in other respects not covered by the proposal we believe that our existing code of conduct is appropriate and comprehensive and that adoption of the proposal is unnecessary shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by a shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at krogers executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting producer responsibility for packaging whereas product packaging is a significant consumer of natural resources and energy and a major source of waste and greenhouse gas ghg emissions more than half of u s produce packaging million tons is discarded in landfills or burned rather than recycled packaging comprises more than one half of all u s landfill waste nestle waters north america says plastic bottles are the largest contributor to its carbon foot print coca cola co reports packaging is the largest part of the carbon footprint of several products a recent analysis of u s environmental protection agency data estimates that the energy needed to produce and dispose of products and packaging accounts for of total u s ghg emissions decaying paper packaging in landfills forms methane whose greenhouse warming potential is times more potent than co metal and plastic packaging has large embodied energy and emissions profiles because of the high costs of producing those packages from mining smelting and petroleum respectively extended producer responsibility epr is a corporate and public policy that shifts accountability for collection and recycling from consumers and governments to producers for instance coca cola pepsico and nestle waters north america have each made public commitments to recycle a majority of beverage containers sold over the next six to eight years in many other countries consumer packaged goods companies are responsible for post consumer packaging companies operating in europe and canada are required to pay some or all costs for packaging collection and recycling more than half of organization for economic cooperation and development member countries have epr packaging systems in place in ontario canada producers pay half of packaging collection and recycling costs epr programs in austria belgium and germany recover far higher rates of packaging than the u s epr laws in u s states already mandate producer responsibility for collection and recycling of consumer electronics producers control design and marketing decisions and so are best positioned to reduce the overall environmental impact of product packaging and internalize costs increased recycling of packaging can yield strong environmental benefits leading to more efficient use of materials reduced extraction of natural resources and fewer ghg and toxic emissions epr mandates can create new economic markets for packaging increased economic incentives to recycle more types of packaging will keep it from flowing into waterways and oceans where it imperils marine life be it resolved that shareowners of the kroger co request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information by sept assessing the feasibility of adopting a policy of extended producer responsibility for post consumer product packaging as a means of reducing carbon emissions and air and water pollution resulting from the companys business practices and describing efforts by the company to implement this strategy supporting statement proponents believe policy options reviewed in the report should include taking responsibility for post consumer package recycling and participating in development of producer financed and managed epr systems the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding waste reduction and recognizes the important role it plays as a good steward of the environment we have numerous sustainability initiatives in place to preserve our natural resources and to conserve energy for instance the company recycled more than million pounds of plastic waste from bags and plastic film in the company also recycles more than a billion pounds of cardboard each year most importantly weve pioneered the perishable donations partnership which enables the donation of more than million pounds of safe wholesome food to feeding america food banks to fight hunger in local communities by implementing innovative methods of donating these food items kroger is reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfills for each of the past several years we have published online the kroger co public responsibilities report and our annual sustainability report that highlight the companys sustainability initiatives and waste reduction efforts in greater detail this proposal requests that kroger take additional steps to report on the feasibility of adopting a policy of extended producer responsibility or epr the resolution provides no guidance regarding proponents view of the requirements of a company adopted epr policy kroger supports efforts to reduce waste in the supply chain as described above and in our various sustainability reports it would be inappropriate however to support a policy that is not clearly defined we believe our support for waste reduction efforts in our supply chain are significant and meaningful kroger is familiar with various epr proposals in states and laws in other countries that require retailers and manufacturers to pay substantial taxes and fees related to waste disposal the proposals vary in detail and implementation and while we do assess new laws and regulations for their feasibility cost and requirements to do so for each individual epr proposal at the federal state and international level would require significant resources that could be allocated more wisely in the best interests of shareholders kroger often is asked to take a position on legislation or regulatory proposals while occasionally we will communicate to federal state and local officials our positions on specific policy issues we believe it is premature to offer an official position statement on epr legislative and regulatory proposals without first carefully examining the specifics of each individual law or regulation and how it would affect our customers and our business shareholder proposals annual meeting shareholder proposals intended for inclusion in our proxy material relating to krogers annual meeting in june should be addressed to the secretary of kroger and

the company employed approximately full and part time employees a majority of the companys employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions there are approximately such agreements usually with terms of three to five years a during the company will negotiate major labor contracts covering store employees in memphis las vegas dayton and columbus ohio indianapolis louisville nashville phoenix and portland these negotiations will be challenging as the company seeks competitive cost structures

stores as of january the company operated either directly or through its subsidiaries supermarkets and multi department stores of which had fuel centers approximately of these supermarkets were operated in company owned facilities including some company owned buildings on leased land the companys current strategy emphasizes self development and ownership of store real estate the companys stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores combo stores multi department stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce multi department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multi department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi department stores they offer full service grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys price impact warehouse stores offer a no frills low cost warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide

food and drug stores multi department stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states the companys retail operations which represent over of the companys consolidated sales

produced in the companys manufacturing plants the remaining corporate brand items are produced to the companys strict specifications by outside manufacturers the company performs a make or buy analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market based transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january the company operated manufacturing plants these plants consisted of dairies deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants three beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants a managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business the kroger co was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nations largest retailers as measured by revenue operating supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger city market dillons jay c food less fred meyer frys king soopers qfc ralphs and smiths of these stores have fuel centers we also operate convenience stores either directly or through franchisees and fine jewelry stores kroger operates manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our retail operations which represent over of krogers consolidated sales and ebitda are our only reportable segment our performance we achieved solid results in our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth increases in loyal household count good cost control as well as growth in earnings and earnings per diluted share our net earnings were million or per diluted share the results included a charge related to the consolidation of multi employer pension plans to which we contribute totaling million pre tax million after tax excluding the charge our adjusted net earnings were billion or per diluted share our identical supermarket sales increased by excluding fuel we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel because our business model emphasizes this primary component and identical sales generate earnings and free cash flow that reward our shareholders increasing market share is an important part of our long term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately basis points in across our marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report this information also indicates that our market share increased in of the marketing areas and declined in six wal mart supercenters are a primary competitor in of our marketing areas our overall market share grew by approximately basis points in in those marketing areas nielsen homescan data is generated by customers who self report their grocery purchases to nielsen regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet these market share results reflect our long term strategy of market share growth results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods net earnings net earnings totaled million in billion in and million in the net earnings for include the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge totaling million after tax the net earnings for include a non cash goodwill impairment charge totaling million after tax related to a small number of stores the net earnings for include non cash asset impairment charges totaling billion after tax related to a division in southern california the impairment charge primarily resulted from the a write off of the ralphs division goodwill balance excluding these charges for and adjusted net earnings were billion in and billion in both and adjusted net earnings improved compared to due to an increase in fifo non fuel operating profit lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by a lifo charge of million pre tax compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in adjusted net earnings improved compared to due to lower interest expense favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins partially offset by decreased non fuel operating

lifo charge of million pre tax in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in compared to increased due to increased retail fuel margins the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and the repurchase of kroger common shares partially offset by reduced non fuel net earnings management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to

percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales interest expense net interest expense totaled million in million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from a lower weighted average interest rate and an average lower debt balance for the year offset partially by a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps the decrease in

taxes our effective income tax rate was in in and in the and effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits and favorable resolution of certain tax issues partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the effective tax rate was also lower than due to the effect on pre tax income of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge of million million after tax excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge our effective rate in would have been the effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because the goodwill impairment charge incurred in that year was mostly non deductible for tax purposes excluding the non cash impairment charges our effective rate in would have been in addition the effective tax rate for differed from the expected federal statutory rate due to the utilization of tax credits resolution of certain tax issues and the effect of state income taxes a common share repurchase program we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule b and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger common shares totaling billion in million in and million in under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately million in million in and million in of kroger shares under the stock option program on march the board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program on september the board of directors authorized a new billion share repurchase program that replaced the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on march as of january we had million remaining on the september billion share repurchase program capital expenditures capital expenditures including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to was due to kroger reducing the capital expenditures in our original plan in order to provide the cash flow necessary to execute our financial strategy capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled million in compared to million for and million for the increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities in compared to was due to kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores in compared to the decrease in capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities in compared to was due to kroger purchasing several more previously leased retail stores and one large distribution center in compared to the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates a we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both workers compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability claims are not discounted we are also similarly self insured for property related losses we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stop loss coverage is in excess of million per claim up to million per claim in california and million outside of california the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in million in and million in included in the amount are asset impairments recorded totaling million for the ralphs reporting unit in southern california we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results a goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of january we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively our reporting units with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of resulted in an impairment charge of million based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax in we disclosed that a reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at this reporting unit in the third quarter of our operating performance suffered due to deflation and intense competition during the third quarter of based on revised forecasts for and the initial results of our annual budget process of the supermarket reporting units management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing of these reporting units in the third quarter of we did not test the variable interest entities with recorded goodwill for impairment as no triggering event occurred based on the results of our step one analysis in the third quarter of the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment in the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by the economic conditions at the time and responses to competitive actions in southern california as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows along with comparable fair value information management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of after tax subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a sales weighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value the discounted cash flows assumed long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performance and a discount rate of in addition the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january assessment based on current and future expected cash flows the company believes additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and see note to the consolidated financial statements the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on a closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings if any in merchandise costs we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred post retirement benefit plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market aa yield curve we utilized a discount rate of and for year end for pension and other benefits respectively a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january by approximately million to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories for and we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of our pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december net of investment management fees and expenses increased for the past years our average annual rate of return has been the average annual return for the a sp over the same period of time has been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe an rate of return assumption is reasonable see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of krogers pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions projected benefit percentage obligation expense point change decrease increase decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets we contributed million in million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans although we are not required to make cash contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions we contributed and expensed million in million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts the k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service multi employer pension plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans in the fourth quarter of we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with locals of the ufcw that participated in four multi employer pension funds the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multi employer pension funds into one multi employer pension fund under the terms of the mou the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through we were designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated plan with sole investment authority over its assets we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the pre consolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability uaal that existed as of december in a series of installments on or before march at january the uaal was estimated to be million pre tax in accordance with gaap we expensed million in related to the uaal the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment as the estimate is updated we may incur additional expense we do not expect any adjustments to be material in the fourth quarter of we contributed million to the consolidated multi employer pension plan of which million was allocated to the uaal and million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in future contributions will be dependent among other things on the investment performance of assets in the plan the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees a we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of million in million in and million in the cash contributions for include the companys million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets i e the amount of underfunding as of december because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing krogers share of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above as of december we estimate that krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion pre tax or billion after tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately million pre tax or million after tax as of december compared to december the december estimate of our underfunding includes the effect of our million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan made in january the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the companys million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan partially offset by increases in underfunded amounts in other plans our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in excluding the million contribution to our ufcw consolidated pension plan our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since in we expect to contribute approximately million to our multi employer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions this amount reflects a contribution decrease due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on current market conditions we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and krogers future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand krogers share of the underfunding could increase and krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi employer pension plans deferred rent we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets a uncertain tax positions we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years through the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately of inventories were valued using the lifo method in both and cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by billion at january and by million at january we follow the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately billion in billion in and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns a liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in compared to billion in and billion in the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization the lifo charge the goodwill impairment charge and changes in working capital the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the decline in net earnings including noncontrolling interests due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge changes in working capital also provided used cash from operating activities of million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for compared to was primarily due to an increase in inventories offset partially by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in addition the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was partially offset by an increase in other long term liabilities for our remaining estimated commitment for the uaal in excess of the cash contribution the change in working capital for compared to was primarily due to increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses in addition the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was partially offset by a decrease in other long term liabilities prepaid expenses decreased in compared to due to kroger not prefunding million of employee benefits in these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling million in million in and million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in compared to primarily due to the decrease in net earnings including noncontrolling interests and from the bonus depreciation deductions allowed by the tax relief act for property placed into service in the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in compared to due to reversals of temporary differences in and overpayments being applied to income taxes net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was billion in compared to billion in and billion in the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in compared to due to decreased payments for other investing activities offset partially by increased payments for acquisitions the amount of cash used by investing

were billion in billion in and billion in refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years net cash used by financing activities financing activities used billion of cash in compared to billion in and million in the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily related to the increased payments for treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased borrowings under our commercial paper program the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily related to the increased payments on long term debt and treasury stock repurchases decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and an investment in the remaining interest of a variable interest entity partially offset by decreased payments on the credit facility we repurchased billion of kroger common shares in compared to million in and million in we paid dividends totaling million in million in and million in debt management total debt including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations increased million to billion as of year end compared to year end the increase in compared to resulted from increased net borrowings of commercial paper of million and a the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of offset by the payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of total debt decreased million to billion as of year end compared to year end the decrease in compared to resulted from the payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of offset by the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of as of january our cash and temporary cash investments were million compared to million as of january this decrease was primarily due to the payment at maturity of our million of senior notes our million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution and the increased share repurchase activity noted above partially offset by the borrowing of commercial paper and the issuance of our million of senior notes described above our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt in we prefunded employee benefit costs of million the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million in and million in both and liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of fiscal year based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately billion of debt due in the next twelve months which is included in the billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt on favorable terms based on our past experience if necessary we believe we can also fund future scheduled principal payments of long term debt from our cash flows from operating activities we also currently do not expect to purchase our common shares at the levels we did in we used our commercial paper program toward the end of to fund our common share purchases we expect our contributions to the ufcw consolidated pension plan to significantly decrease in future periods we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities in but do not expect to use the program permanently we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper cp program at january we had million of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio were to exceed to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio a our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio fell below to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our ufcw consolidated pension plan charge in our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments ufcw consolidated pension plan commitment purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans which totaled million in including our million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined as of january we had million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets a our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of january we maintained a billion with the ability to increase by million unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on january we amended the credit agreement subsequent to year end to update our covenants for the exclusion of the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge all other terms remained the same outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained two uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january we had million of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january we had authorized for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a ownership interest our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability a recently issued accounting standards in september the fasb amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test the two step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the new rules are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december however entities were permitted to adopt the standards early we did not adopt these standards early for our goodwill impairment testing process because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed the amended standards will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements in june the fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new rules were to become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december in december the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the december effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments because the standards only affect the display of comprehensive income and do not affect what is included in comprehensive income the standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in may the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards this amendment primarily changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition the amendment clarified the fasbs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items that are not recorded at fair value but as to which fair value is required to be disclosed the new rules became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december while we are still finalizing our evaluation of the effect of this amended standard on our consolidated financial statements we believe this new standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about krogers future performance these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flows projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially a we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for this guidance assumes the benefit of the rd week a lower expected lifo charge the benefit of our share buyback program during the benefit from the pension plan consolidation and the benefit from transfers of prescriptions to our stores from customers that previously used a former third party pharmacy provider to obtain their express scripts benefits we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in this guidance contemplates the effect of several brand prescription drugs coming off patent during which will reduce sales because generic equivalents have a lower retail price our business model is designed to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over a rolling three to five year time horizon including our dividend our business model is designed to generate total shareholder return on average of to over a rolling three to five year time period in annual earnings per diluted share growth are expected to be higher than this due to a combination of the benefit of the rd week a lower expected lifo charge the benefit of our share buyback program during the benefits from the pension plan consolidation and the benefit from express scripts prescription transfers for we intend to continue to focus on improving sales growth in accordance with our customer st strategy by making investments in gross margin and customer shopping experiences we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions we expect fifo non fuel operating margins for to expand slightly compared to excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge in for we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million to million this forecast is based on estimated cost changes for products in our inventory for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to maintain our current debt coverage ratios to pay cash dividends and to repurchase stock as market conditions change we re evaluate these uses of cash flow we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels in addition we intend to continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate and logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investments for to be in the range of billion excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit facility and other borrowing sources for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases a we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax issues we expect rent expense as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration productivity improvements shrink warehousing and transportation we intend to invest most of these savings in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers although we are not required to make cash contributions to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately million in addition we expect k retirement savings account plan cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in compared to we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans in subject to collective bargaining in addition we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years we do not anticipate additional goodwill impairments in we have various labor agreements that will be renegotiated in covering store employees in memphis las vegas dayton and columbus ohio indianapolis louisville nashville phoenix and portland upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us changes in market conditions could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that increased fuel costs have on consumer spending changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases the effect of brand prescription drugs going off patent our ability to obtain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors such as express scripts the benefits that we receive from the consolidation of the ufcw pension plans and the success of our future growth plans our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above a the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including inflation or deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost increases will depend on the reactions of our customers and competitors to those increases our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized in addition to the factors identified above our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing our operating margins without fuel could decline or fail to meet expectations if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if we fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing kroger and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected outcomes in these matters however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable cannot be foreseen rent expense which includes subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy increased store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets or the remaining terms of leases use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of participants the amounts of our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could vary from the amounts that we expect and could increase more than anticipated should asset values in these funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated a if volatility in the financial markets continues or worsens our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated in future years changes in laws or regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers which could affect sales and earnings changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin gasoline sales provide a positive effect on oga expense as a percentage of sales our capital expenditures expected square footage growth and number of store projects completed over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if economic conditions fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment changes in our credit ratings fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt impairment losses including goodwill could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows market values or business valuations in the market our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment real estate market values competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our estimated expense and obligation for kroger sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts these assumptions include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products or may decrease customer demand for certain products increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products additionally increases in the cost of inputs such as utility costs or raw material costs could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives a report of

year ends on the saturday nearest january the last three fiscal years consist of the week periods ended january january and january pervasiveness of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of consolidated revenues and expenses during the reporting period also is required actual results could differ from those estimates inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a last in first out lifo basis or market in total approximately of inventories for and were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the first in first out fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by at january and at january the company follows the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating its lifo charge or credit the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment is followed for substantially all store inventories at the companys supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory when compared to the retail method of accounting the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date a notes to consolidated financial statements continued property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets buildings and land improvements are depreciated based on lives varying from to years all new purchases of store equipment are assigned lives varying from three to nine years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term to which they relate which varies from four to years or the useful life of the asset manufacturing plant and distribution center equipment is depreciated over lives varying from three to years information technology assets are generally depreciated over five years depreciation and amortization expense was in in and in interest costs on significant projects constructed for the companys own use are capitalized as part of the costs of the newly constructed facilities upon retirement or disposal of assets the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in net earnings deferred rent the company recognizes rent holidays including the time period during which the company has access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the companys consolidated balance sheets goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if the company identifies impairment for long lived assets to be held and used the company compares the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows the company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for sale the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal the company recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling and in and respectively included in the amount are asset impairments recorded totaling for the ralphs reporting unit in southern california costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets for each of the years presented have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense a notes to consolidated financial statements continued store closing costs the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income the company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the companys policy on impairment of long lived assets inventory write downs if any in connection with store closings are classified in merchandise costs costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred the following table summarizes accrual activity for future lease obligations of stores that were closed in the normal course of business future lease obligations balance at january additions payments other balance at january additions payments other balance at january interest rate risk management the company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates the companys current program relative to interest rate protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its derivative instruments are described in note commodity price protection the company enters into purchase commitments for various resources including raw materials utilized in its manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in its stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices the company enters into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of the normal course of business the companys current program relative to commodity price protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its purchase commitments are described in note a notes to consolidated financial statements continued benefit plans and multi employer pension plans the company recognizes the funded status of its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci all plans are measured as of the companys fiscal year end the determination of the obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company also participates in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded refer to note for additional information regarding the companys participation in these various multi employer plans and the ufcw consolidated fund the company administers and makes contributions to the employee k retirement savings accounts contributions to the employee k retirement savings accounts are expensed when contributed refer to note for additional information regarding the companys benefit plans stock based compensation the company accounts for stock options under fair value recognition provisions under this method the company recognizes compensation expense for all share based payments granted the company recognizes share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition the company records expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the awards lapse deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting basis refer to note for the types of differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as a net current or noncurrent asset or liability based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes a deferred tax asset or liability that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is classified according to the expected reversal date uncertain tax positions the company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in its consolidated financial statements refer to note for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit the companys income tax returns these audits include questions regarding the companys tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes the company records allowances for probable exposures a notes to consolidated financial statements continued a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years through the assessment of the companys tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the companys various filing positions self insurance costs the company is primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis the company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits the following table summarizes the changes in the companys self insurance liability through january beginning balance expense claim payments ending balance less current portion long term portion the current portion of the self insured liability is included in other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the company is also similarly self insured for property related losses the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to losses in excess of on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stop loss coverage is in excess of per claim up to per claim in california and outside of california revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale discounts provided to customers by the company at the time of sale including those provided in connection with loyalty cards are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold discounts provided by vendors usually in the form of paper coupons are not recognized as a reduction in sales provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons the company records a receivable from the vendor for the difference in sales price and cash received pharmacy sales are recorded when provided to the customer sales taxes are recorded as other accrued liabilities and not as a component of sales the company does not recognize a sale when it sells its own gift cards and gift certificates rather it records a deferred liability equal to the amount received a sale is then recognized when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed to purchase the companys products gift card and certificate breakage is recognized when redemption is deemed remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card the amount of breakage has not been material for and merchandise costs the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations includes product costs net of discounts and allowances advertising costs see separate discussion below inbound freight charges warehousing costs including receiving and inspection costs transportation costs and manufacturing a notes to consolidated financial statements continued production and operational costs warehousing transportation and manufacturing management salaries are also included in the merchandise costs line item however purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the operating general and administrative line item along with most of the companys other managerial and administrative costs rent expense and depreciation expense are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the companys approach is to include in the merchandise costs line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold advertising costs the companys advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations the companys pre tax advertising costs totaled in in and in the company does not record vendor allowances for co operative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense deposits in

investing in assets whose allocation is materially below target if markets are illiquid the company may not be able to rebalance to target quickly to maintain actual asset allocations consistent with target allocations assets are reallocated or rebalanced periodically in addition cash flow from employer contributions and participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes

as of january four multi employer pension funds were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan see the above information regarding this multi employer pension fund consolidation a notes to consolidated financial statements continued based on the most recent information available to it the company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits moreover if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds the company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated the

other multi employer benefit plans were approximately in and in and recently issued accounting standards in september the fasb amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test the two step impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the new rules are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december however entities were permitted to adopt the standards early the company did not adopt these standards early for its goodwill impairment testing process because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed the amended standards will not have an effect on the companys consolidated financial statements in june the fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new rules were to become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december in december the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the december effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments because the standards only affect the display of comprehensive income and do not affect what is included in comprehensive income the standards will not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements in may the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards this amendment primarily changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition the amendment clarified the fasbs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items that are not recorded at fair value but as to which fair value is required to be disclosed the new rules became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december while the company is still finalizing its evaluation of the effect of this amended standard on its consolidated financial statements the company believes this new standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements a notes to consolidated financial statements continued investment in variable interest entity in february the
