over the next several years im now happy to take your questions questions and answers operator at this time we will begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and our first question will come from john heinbockel of guggenheim securities john heinbockel so mike two things first just strategically do you guys envision bobs role just running roundys directly or something more significant longer term i know hes but i think about his merchandising skills and that certainly can help the entire company and then what do you think particularly maybe on the fresh side you pick up here that you didnt have with harris teeter is it simply urban versus more suburban the kroger company november at a m eastern mike schlotman well first on bob he is very energized and excited by this transaction and he is excited to become part of our team i wouldnt venture to guess what his future role will be were clearly going to need him to help drive the results we expect to get both in chicago and as we make investments in wisconsin be part of bringing that team together to driving better sale results as well as a better experience for not only our customers but our associates as well from a fresh standpoint john i think when you go to the stores in chicago there are a lot of interesting things that bob and his team have done in chicago fred and his team have done a lot of interesting things with their urban formats and harris teeter and just like weve picked up things from harris teeter i think therell be incremental ideas and processes we can pick up from bob and what hes done in chicago some of the unique things they do for instance some of their coffee shops they have a local roaster come in to the stores and run the coffee shop thats the same guy that people see down the street so they have a big focus on finding that local feel inside the store so that its more than just a grocery store its an experience of other opportunities that are in and around the neighborhoods weve done that a little bit in a few kroger stores theres a couple in our indianapolis division theres one in lexington where we have almost a food truck kind of feel inside the store where these local merchants have a section of the store where they have their product available for purchase by our customers and this i think we had the opportunity to take that to another level john heinbockel all right then secondly more tactically obviously their ebitda was down in the last quarter the environment is difficult competitively but do you think and you made the comment of reinvesting the synergies are the margins too high today in that market for that in particularly so that needs to be reset perhaps and then going forward i guess you would expect most of the ebitda growth even with that kind of market share to come from top line and i guess in wisconsin a lot of it would come from additional incremental share is that fair mike schlotman john when we look at where roundys is it feels very similar to a journey weve been on for the last or years with our customer first journey they arent starting at the beginning of where we started our customer first journey theyve made some investments in price i would say from a competitive pricing standpoint theyre in better position today than when we started our customer first journey so there will be some investment in all four keys of the customer first people product shopping experience and price we clearly see a path where we can grow revenue particularly in wisconsin with the number of stores they have were thrilled with the real estate sites theyre well situated over of these sites we would rate a or b so its great real estate we may need to invest some in infrastructure may need to invest some in some more hours in some of the service departments but those are things we know how to do and can do were just really thrilled with this opportunity joining with bob and you look at markets like milwaukee and madison they feel like other markets that kroger operates in today in the midwest whether its indianapolis or columbus or louisville it just feels like home almost when youre there making the stores just the values of the people the way they live and go about their daily lives what we do should resonate very well with them the kroger company november at a m eastern john heinbockel okay thank you mike schlotman you bet john operator and the next question will come from edward kelly of credit suisse judah frommer hi guys this is actually judah on for ed on the synergies following up there the million do you have any preliminary expectations on how much is it investment in price versus labor or kind of ballpark there mike schlotman well of course we do of course i wont go into that on the call we obviously need toa lot of those are done from our view of things and where we think we need to go once we get regulatory approval and get this closed which will be very fast in our judgement because we really arent in these markets with this kind of a footprint not in wisconsin at all we think well be able to hit the ground running very quickly bob knows investments he wants to make as you know theyve launched the wisconsin proud program recently where they took some pricing investments hes been somewhat hamstrung with the leverage theyve had on their balance sheet to do everything he would have wanted to do so i think bob has a pretty good feel of exactly what he wants to do well also identify some stores and go in and refresh some of their footprint in madison and milwaukee so the customer understands what were going to stand for in the future so im real excited about the opportunity judah frommer okay and for marianos do you have expectations around plans for additional expansion within chicago and maybe going outside of the chicago area which i know bob was kind of hesitant to do in the near term mike schlotman yeah again i think bob has a well formulated plan of what he wants to do hes also been living with the reality of what he could do with the free cash flow that we generate on an annual basis and again i would look at that the same way as i would look at wisconsin and how well make investments there well develop a solid plan for both the chicago market and the wisconsin market and we feel we have ample dollars built into our model to be able to support growth in both store count and revenue in both markets judah frommer okay great thank you mike schlotman you bet the kroger company november at a m eastern operator and next we have a question from karen short of deutsche bank karen short hi i have a couple of questions just looking at roundys i mean i see your million number in the press release but im curious just about overhead elimination in terms of the roundys banner in general i mean it would seem to me that theres considerable overhead that may go away so that your estimates are somewhat conservative on the accretion mike schlotman yeah you always think were conservative though karen karen short yeah krogys conservative mike schlotman is that it is that it yeah im started to say kroger and roundys at the same didnt i i wouldnt go down the path of overhead elimination because as we step back and look at this we want to make sure we have the right focus on the stores in wisconsin as well and there could be some shifting of folks of how we are on the ground on a daily basis our structure of how we manage our stores is a little bit different than them we would have perhaps more folks in some of our district teams making sure that the stores are running the way we want them to run and some of the overhead could be a reallocation that we believe will drive better store conditions on a regular basis which will ultimately lead to better sales results which will ultimately lead to better ebitda generation so some of thats up in the air right now and its way too early to speculate on overhead karen short okay and then i guess just looking at the legacy conventional banners i mean obviously we all see what the comps are and roundys had more recently been giving us comps at both banners and its clear that the conventional are struggling it partly seems to be a competitive issue so i guess can you maybe help us get comfortable with whywhat you think you can do and i appreciate it might have been a balance sheet issue from bobs perspective in terms of being restricted on his abilities mike schlotman karen in many respects when i talk to their team and im in wisconsin i kind of feel like kroger did in the early part of the century as we were facing a lot of wal marts coming into our markets and our results were struggling certainly sales were struggling and until we stepped back and created the customer first strategy with the four prongs thats when things really turned around now theyve made some price moves there will probably be more as i said theyre not as far off the market as we were when we started the journey but this feels very much likeif you think about this its one kroger division thats just going to begin the customer first journey about a third of the way into it and thats what gives us the comfort is they have started to make strides we need to spend some money in the stores inside the stores some capital money thats built in bobs helping us understand where we should spend that first to get the biggest bang they do have a loyalty card so the richness of the data we think is going to be very robust well be able to immediately run that through the algorithms that brings to us and hopefully get some of the same the kroger company november at a m eastern benefit and results out of understanding their customer data the same way we understand our customer data so theres a lot of similarities to the journey weve been on and thats one of the things that gives us such comfort being able tonobody has said it yet and the first three of you have been very kind this is closer to a fixer upper that we said weve never done but we also would say the first thing we look at is people and their values and the way they want to treat customers and associates we check that box the second one thats most important is the real estate in the right location and we love where the real estate is we know how to help them and they know what they need to do and well have the financial wherewithal to help them make the investments that theyve just been making slowly because of the constraints theyve had karen short okay thats really helpful and just last quick question can you remind me how many stores that marianos are currently committed to like in the pipeline is it five or is it several more than that mike schlotman i dont have that number handy with me im actually not in cincinnati today tim do you have that i know tim terrells on the line in cincinnati do you have that number tim by chance tim terrell mike i think that we dont have the exact commitment but clearly theyve got three that will certainly open next year and i think there are two right behind whether those are formally committed or not i dont know mike schlotman so its a single digit number but bob also knows where he wants to put some so karen short great thank you mike schlotman yep operator and the next question is from priya ohri jupta of barclays priya ohri jupta great thank you so much for taking the question mike just wanted to see if we could get a little bit more detail around the debt financing for the transaction as i understand it roundys does have some bonds in place that are not callable until late next year the rest of their debt is term loan should we think about you guys sort of looking to finance the bulk of this in the long term debt capital markets before year end or closing or are you anticipating to just use short term borrowings through the cp market to address some of the refinancing needs as they come up thanks mike schlotman yeah we certainly have the capacity under our credit facility to issue commercial paper to be able to execute the closing by the end of the year the kroger company november at a m eastern when we look at the debt i would say that the term loan and things like that will be refinanced quickly i believe the bonds have call options with a slight premium that actually start this december they are secured with some liens against things so we want to be careful not to get debt like that into the kroger capital structure so i would expect to see us to figure out how to refinance their debt in the very near term i wont rush to the marketultimately ill issue long term debt but i wont rush to the market to do it if the market is a little choppy cause i do have plenty of dry powder in my revolver at a very great rate and ill refinance the debt over the time when the market conditions are right for it priya ohri jupta thats very helpful thank you mike schlotman yep operator and the next question comes from rupesh parikh of oppenheimer rupesh parikh thanks for taking my question so mike i wanted to delve further into maybe on the indiscernible diving side if you can maybe help us understand how penetrated roundys is in natural organic and private label versus kroger mike schlotman they have a good offering of both they use a third party for most of their private label we think the private label area is something that can be beneficial i would be surprised if early on in this process a banner like private selection and simple truth wouldnt be some labels that we would look at getting into both banners relatively quick i would say most of those conversations and thought processes now that the merger has started we can start having some high level conversations about those kinds of things certainly when you look at the marianos stores theres a big emphasis on fresh and natural and organic kinds of product and we know how well that product resonates with customers love the fact that they have the richness of the data of their loyalty card to be able to understand what their customers are buying inside the store but even more importantly what they arent buying and how to make sure that what they arent buying that we know theyre probably buying somewhere that we can figure out a way to make sure they know were going to have that product and its going to be high quality at a good price so we love the fact that they have that card thats going to help us understand that rupesh parikh okay great and one more question i had as you look at kroger store base what portion of that base would you consider as urban stores mike schlotman oh gosh rupesh parikh im just trying to get a sense of the benefits you see or what could be transported to maybe some of your other locations the kroger company november at a m eastern mike schlotman well theres urban and thentheres lots of stores this isnt just urban some of this offering will play well in the right suburban stores too cause theres parts of suburbs that feel more urban the way some of these planned developments have happened i would venture its several hundred stores that some of this kind of offering could wind up in the other thing is is if we take the learnings of harris teeter and their urban stores and certainly what theyre doing with charlotte with a couple as well as the dc baltimore area add to that the learnings that well get from marianos it does open up the possibility for urban stores in other markets as well where we may not have them and thats as exciting as being able to take some of the learnings to existing stores rupesh parikh thank you mike schlotman yep operator and our next question comes from andrew wolf of bbt capital markets andrew wolf hi good morning mike schlotman hi andy good morning andrew wolf on thewhat you just said about taking potentially taking marianos concept to urban markets where you dont have stores so are you talking about places where you literally dont have stores or places like la where you could also have stores but could put in the marianos concept or are you thinking of potentially building i know its early on but im just trying to clarify mike schlotman yeah i would say it could potentially be either there are still a lot of markets we arent in and we continue to look at new markets to enter either organically or through ma but i look at a market like cincinnati where the urban core is growing in a big way and the number of people moving back downtown we really dont have a store in the urban center that would be the kind of store that the folks would want to shop in theres onetheres a great store a couple of miles away but these folks like to buy product if theyre going to eat at home on thursday and they decide that at they would prefer to walk down the street to their store and i think a lot of these learnings will allow us to understand how to satisfy that kind of customers need andrew wolf thank you and the other question i wanted to see if you would talk about is during your due diligence did you kind of take sort of a sum of the parts view marianos as being very distinct from the core pick n save and the wisconsin banners so first of all yes or no and if so could you share a little bit not the numbers itself but maybe a sense of the variance between the two in terms of you would value them the kroger company november at a m eastern mike schlotman well were excited with both pieces of this chain and they both bring something to the party when i look at wisconsin and the around stores just under that in wisconsin and the opportunity to grow that footprint and both the sales in the existing footprint and perhaps the footprint overall is a very exciting piece of this when we get their sales turned around and they become positive in wisconsin that could be a verythat will be a very positive piece of the return of this deal thats one of the reasons why this will be slightly accretive early on and as our investments mature we would expect it to be a bigger contributor out into the future but were not going to force that issue early on knowing that theres investments we want to make andrew wolf okay thank you mike schlotman mm hmm operator the next question is from scott mushkin of wolfe research scott mushkin hey guys thanks for taking my questions mike schlotman sure scott mushkin so my first one mike is obviously the marianos asset is a great asset and i think your assessment is dead on i guess with the bonds i think were trading before the acquisition about on the dollar i guess why now and why pay such a premium if the business was this tough and it looked like the bond market was saying maybe they werent working out theyd have to file so i just wanted your insight on why now why the premium mike schlotman well i understand the headline premium looks very very high keep in mind when youre trading at a number that starts with a two it doesnt take much of an increase in the offer to make the premium sound very high on an equity basis its a significantly different looking premium when you look on an enterprise value basis of what they closed at yesterday and what theyre trading at today i think if you look at an ebitda multiple its reasonable compared to other deals that have transacted out there with or without synergies i think the why now is sometimes these things just come together at a particular point in time and they still have very strong sales and market leadership in wisconsin we know theyve had some supercenters come in via both wal mart and indiscernible out of grand rapids weve proven the ability to compete with those folks and its just one of those things that the deal happened when it happened and i know where the bonds were trading thats only a couple hundred million dollars of the capital structure most of the debt thats out there is the term loan and it just felt like the right time and as you and i have talked over time the people box was checked and the real estate location box the kroger company november at a m eastern was checked and it just came together now and were thrilled that it did and bobs thrilled that it did and hes energized and cant wait to be able to execute some of the strategies that hes done slowly and well enable him to do it a little bit faster scott mushkin oh hes getting a diamond in the rough with the marianos so thats good stuff so my second question is youre going to be a little bit over two times i guess once you close on the debt metrics and how do we think about other ma i mean the business the industry i should say is clearly having some rough times certainly certain operators we may see more assets come free maybe in the southeast maybe in other places how do we think about other ma now that weve done this transaction mike schlotman yeah well still be comfortably inside our two to times ratio obviously weve communicated with the rating agencies they understand what were doing theyve asked a lot of the same questions you all have asked relative to this is a little bit different why now but a lot of this is things weve done even the harris teeter deal weve obviously invested a lot of money and pricing there so its not unusual for us to merge with a chain that needs some price investment this one needs a little bit more investment in the infrastructure than some of the other deals weve done but again we love the real estate locations and just really excited for this to be part of the kroger team scott mushkin so does it preclude further mike schlotman i would say no were comfortably inside the two to times obviously with harris teeter we went above times had the conversations with the rating agencies that we would manage our way back down to that ratio did it in months instead the to we promised them were very transparent with the rating agencies with the level of cash flow we have we have the ability to move levers around and make sure that if an opportunity comes up that we have the dry powder to take advantage of it scott mushkin thats perfect and then my third and final question and i appreciate you taking them all is roundys is a little bit different than harris teeter you got the union in there they have a central state pension any thoughts on that central state pension i know roundys has been trying to do some work on that and just kind of that attractiveness of that wisconsin market given theyre losing population so just kind of general thoughts i mean i think chicago i get i think the wisconsin one with the pension issue and some other things can you maybe talk to that mike schlotman well clearly we understand the pension issues as well as anybody and factored the obligations they have either on their balance sheet or off their balance sheet into our valuation of the entity it was certainly built into our view of value and i wouldnt shy away from the wisconsin market there are still plenty of folks there and still plenty of sales available and in my mind i agree with your comment i dont even know if i would call marianos a diamond in the rough because we like a lot of what bobs done i think our ability to restore the kroger company november at a m eastern the wisconsin market to what it was a few years ago is the huge upside in this transaction and we feel great about our opportunity to do that particularly given the location of the stores the store size and the ability to do what we want inside the four walls scott mushkin all right perfect thanks for taking my questions mike schlotman you bet operator and the next question is from vincent sinisi of morgan stanley vincent sinisi hey good morning guys thanks very much for taking my question mike schlotman uh huh vincent sinisi i wanted to ask mike on your comments about the ability to grow revenues and potentially square footage as well within wisconsin if you look at the three banners and pick n save obviously being the largest of them but are all three of them similar in terms of the level of investment the level of kind of turning around thats needed is it more kind of the pricing and the merchandising or is there any kind of physical store investment as well maybe you could just kind of help us qualitatively think through the buckets of investment mike schlotman yeah i think therell be some of everything you mentioned therell be some investment in associates therell be some merchandising things that between us and bob well want to get done certainly some investment in the physical assets themselves that well wind up doing we want the folks of wisconsin to understand that theyre going to have a different experience going forward and hopefully a much better shopping experience i would tell you its not unlike or years with kroger when we added the shopping experience indiscernible i would tell you our customers today tell you the shopping experience at kroger is dramatically different than it was or years ago and we hope to be able to export that to wisconsin and get those customers as excited as the rest of the markets that were in today indiscernible those customers are vincent sinisi okay and then just as aand thats helpful thank you just as a quick follow up kind of can you give us a sense for when the conversations with roundys started a while back you had mentioned about kroger at some point doing a new market and format kind of expansion was this a thought at that point or is this something thats completely separate mike schlotman yeah i wont go down that path ill let roundys file the papers they have to file that will document the process vincent sinisi okay fair enough thanks mike the kroger company november at a m eastern operator and the next comes from chuck cerankosky of northcoast research chuck cerankosky good morning everyone and congratulations to kroger on this pending transaction mike schlotman thanks chuck cerankosky hey mike could you give us an idea of what the cadence or pace might be of achieving that million in synergy you said its over the long term but is that two to three years or three to five and how much comes early rather than late but also it sounds like much of it is going to be supply chain opportunities are those going to be in fact addressed first and will they immediately be rolled into price and service before we see it helping the bottom line of the overall company mike schlotman yeah i wont go too far on your question chuck but obviously having harris teeter experience very recent its given us great insight to where we would expect to find some bigger dollars early on and were comfortable to be able to get a good number of dollars fairly quickly without any disruption to the people in the organization based on our learnings with harris teeter weve gotten a great amount of synergies out of that transaction and there have been no headcount reductions at harris teeter and i think well have the same experience here we know exactly where they are some of its services some of its being able to buy at different price levels theres a litany of things and places that well wind up getting it you just think aboutjust start with the cost of being a public company that goes away that saves a chunk of money right off the top so there are things like that that will happen pretty quickly that will enable us to hit the ground running chuck cerankosky all right thank you mike schlotman yep operator the next questions from joe edelscein of stephens joe edelscein hi good morning everyone mike schlotman good morning joe edelscein a lot of great questions and answers so far i was hoping that you could just come back to the real the kroger company november at a m eastern estate mike youve mentioned that a number of times just how pleased you are with how those locations look im curious are there are opportunities to add some fuel stations particularly to the legacy roundys locations probably not as applicable to the urban marianos banners but is this part of the overall strategy as well i know that youve been quite successful in the fuel business this far mike schlotman i think as we go down the path of getting this merger closed and we develop the joint strategy with bob and his team the way i would look at it is everything we have in our arsenal will be on the table and well deploy those items first that make the most sense are going to resonate the most as weve rolled out fuel centers it obviously has been good for kroger we like the business most of these stores are leased i wish they were owned but most of them area leased so that usually means from a fuel center standpoint youre negotiating with landlords that in some cases is easier than others so well develop a strategy for everything thats made kroger what kroger is today from the four legs of the customer first strategy from the use of analyzing their customer data and really all the different merchandising techniques weve done and well deploy those as it makes sense and we can do it you dont want to overwhelm the people either but you want to get going quickly so its a fine balance there joe edelscein thats helpful and you also spoke to the pharmacies inside the stores just how much opportunity do you have really as a combined entity now potentially even accelerate the clinics that youve been putting into your stores mike schlotman yeah well they have pharmacies and we self distribute pharmaceuticals and that was a nice savings in the harris teeter transaction i would expect that to be one of the earlier buckets of synergy savings relative to clinics we dont have clinics in every market were in the process right now of trying to dense up the markets where we are and get the right number rather than using a shotgun approach of putting a few everywhere were trying to do it more of a rifle shoot to get this city done then get this city done you get that core it becomes a business that you stand for not unlike fuel we dont have fuel at every location but customers figure out where the fuel is closest to their house so they can buy it and i would look at clinics the same way there are plenty of other markets where we dont have clinics yet either that at some point in time i would think that would be on the table to discuss as well joe edelscein okay sounds great and good luck on the completion of the merger mike schlotman thanks operator and next we have a question from mark wiltamuth of jefferies mark wiltamuth hi good morning the kroger company november at a m eastern mike schlotman hi mark mark wiltamuth first i just wanted to confirm that the million of synergies is operational and kind of exclusive of savings youll get on interest expense from refinancing mike schlotman yeah its a little bit of everything mark wiltamuth okay and then maybe just get your temperature mike schlotman keep in mind mark if you just step back and did the math on interest expense it winds up being pretty big one of the ways i want to think about it is when i look at the capital im going to invest in this market i would be charging myself for the interest on that new investment so if i spent million of capital i wouldnt do that as interest free in the market i would charge if you will the division for that interest expense so while it may go down a lot quickly itll creep back up as i deploy capital in the market and give them an interest change if that makes sense mark wiltamuth right and then maybe you could help us think about the reinvestment back into the business how much is this going to step on accretion youre saying slightly accretive here in near term but could we get up to like a harris teeter level of accretion like a few years out mike schlotman yeah im not going to speculate out into the future we have a great work plan designed for the first couple of years to get the business reinvigorated get the sales momentum back into wisconsin stores and we do have bigger expectations out into the future but i wont go there at this point mark wiltamuth okay and just back to marianos do you think theres an opportunity to take that entire business model and move it into other markets i mean that ebitda margin that they target is relatively low and there is a pretty low center of store pricing strategy there do you like the whole strategy theyve got financially or do you think youll just be picking and choosing the parts you like as you move forward mike schlotman yeah i think what makes us a little unique in how we do these is we try to figure out the best sum of the parts and my guess is as we deploy things therell be facets that came from a harris teeter therell be facets that came from a marianos therell be facets that came from a kroger or name the banner fresh fare kind of store and were continually evolving our offering and we dont stand static i mean if you think about when we first did marketplace stores and converted the stores after the fred meyer merger in phoenix and if you look at the marketplace stores of today they still say marketplace on it but theyre dramatically different as we learned over time and i would think about the kroger company november at a m eastern how do we continue to evolve this kind of a format with now multiple different views of what works inside the format making the sum of the parts what really resonates mark wiltamuth okay and then just strategically do you think youre going to be making more of a push into natural organic urban now that you have more tools in your tool chest mike schlotman rodney has often said this its probably safe to assume if theres some kind of a format out there that seems successful you should assume were trying it or testing it somewhere we just dont talk about it mark wiltamuth okay well thank you very much mike schlotman you bet operator the next question is from meredith adler of barclays meredith adler i was just about to remove my question because i guess ill just follow up with mark just ask you i had heard that marianos provided a great customer experience but wasnt necessarily that profitable but i dont follow roundys is there something that you are particularly focused on to make that format more profitable or just sharing your scale and best practices mike schlotman i think its a little bit of all of that meredith and theyre burdened with the same overhead costs that anybodys burdened with i mean when you think about store chain being a public company just taking that public company cost and burdening all the stores with it makes it tough a tough environment to operate in frankly i think thats one of the things harris teeter was going to start to run up against as publix entered into charlotte how could they as a couple hundred store chain make the investments they needed to make in charlotte to compete against publix as they came into that market and didnt just give share away i think thats one of the tipping points harris teeter had and when youre the public company like that take away the focus of wall street wondering how youre going to do just the overhead and expense of being a public company become quite a burden on just stores my expense of a public company isnt dramatically different its a little bit higher but i get to spread it over stores its like putting in a new computer system our qvision system i couldnt have afforded qvision if i was chain store or store chain when i spread that over stores now almost stores those kinds of things become very very affordable because the allocation to each store is so small and the benefit is so big that you can get a great return on those kinds of investments and i would expect things like that to happen not only in chicago but wisconsin as well meredith adler okay great thank you mike schlotman yep the kroger company november at a m eastern operator the next question comes from todd duvick of wells fargo todd duvick hi mike just a couple of balance sheet questions follow up from some previous questions given that the million acquisition is going to elevate your leverage but keep it within the range should we expect all million to be termed out in the debt capital markets or just a portion mike schlotman i would say we had a bondwe kroger had a bond that matured here recently that we paid off with commercial paper as well and well develop a strategy for how much of that and this well term out i like keeping a fair amount on my commercial paper out there i like being in the market on a regular basis with commercial paper its obviously my cheapest form of debt and yeah i realize some day interest rates are going to go up but commercial paper will still probably for a very long time be my cheapest form of debt so we like to make sure that we are exposed all the way along the maturity curve and well be pretty thoughtful about where we place this debt one from an annual amount of maturities as well as making sure that were exposed to different spots on the yield curve todd duvick okay thats helpful and then in terms of timing most likely this transaction is going to close by the end of the year if it goes as planned were probably going to be looking for you in the market sometime after the first of the year is that a reasonable expectation mike schlotman yeah ill be non committal in exactly when well access the market todd duvick fair enough thank you mike schlotman yep operator the next question comes from filippe goossens of mufg filippe goossens yes good morning mike thanks for taking my question i actually have a two part question and the first one actually has been answered already through your comments this morning basically what i was trying to ascertain was to what an extent the acquisition of roundys was driven by strategic reasons i e get into the urban market format or strengthen your present chicago market versus a turnaround story because historically you have not really done turnaround stories so i think this one probably is a little bit of a mix of both objectives is that a correct assessment for that question mike mike schlotman its a little bit of a mix i would agree with that but again i go back to the real estate in wisconsin the kroger company november at a m eastern and lets say i decided i wanted to enter wisconsin as a new market or milwaukee just milwaukee as a new market as weve talked about going into new markets the amount of time it would take for me to get locations i think thats what they have in milwaukee the pick n saves theres of them the time it would take me to get stores and the ability to get them located where theyve been located for a very long time would take quite a while when you go into a new market you usually lose a little bit of money early on because youre entering the market you have a lot of overhead you have one store so if i put an ad in the street its the same price to put an ad in the street for one store or stores so we look at this as were going into these markets as a new market but were going in with a billion book of business great market share and some ebitda already and we feel we can grow from here filippe goossens great and then my second question mike a little bit more holistic i would say in nature and kind of piggybacking on an earlier question from somebody with regard to future ma interest if i look at your portfolio mike am i correct to recall that right now you only have kind of one format that kind of comes close to a limited assortment store format i e food less and the reason im asking is yesterday i picked up in the european press that indiscernible has set up a headquarters in arlington virginia planning to open their first stores in indiscernible and then growing very quickly thereafter now if weve seen or if we observed what they have done together with all the end uk markets where they have now an market share and have really caught some headaches i guess for the incumbent traditional supermarket is that a format that could be of interest for you youve been very successful on the natural food side with the simple truth label do you also envision that at some point in time you may do something on the more limited assortment side of the market mike schlotman well as i said in response to i think marks question its probably safe to assume if theres something out there weve been trying it we actually have some what we call ruler stores that are limited assortment that we continue to try to understand whats the right offering and the right customer acceptance of those models weve obviously competed against save a lot for a very long time and compete against a significant number of aldis already weve been very aware of the fact that leedle ph has brought the property in the virginia area and indiscernible market we always build our business model assuming things arent going to get easier that theyre probably going to continue to stay tough over time and we face a lot of that kind of competition today and i dont want to be dismissive of it because both aldi and leedle are great operators but we understand what makes them tick and we spend a lot of time not just in stores in the us but worldwide and were impressed with what they do but again weve continued to be successful in markets where we have a lot of aldis and save a lots already filippe goossens great thank you so much for that insight mike mike schlotman yep the kroger company november at a m eastern operator and the next question comes from aj jain of pivotal research group aj jain yeah hi good morning thanks for taking my question my first question is just high level in terms of whether theres been a shift in your acquisition strategy i think at the recent investor conference i believe you mentioned that you werent really looking to enter markets since harris teeter offered an opportunity to expand into the dc market so i think that recent commentary represented maybe a shift in your acquisition strategy compared to what was said back in during that investor conference so do you have any feedback mike on how roundys might seem at least on the surface a little inconsistent or might have a different profile compared to i think it was rodneys recent commentary on acquisition strategy so im just wondering are you being completely opportunistic at this point or is there a clearly defined strategy mike schlotman let me try to tie all the different comments together and im going to try to make sure everybody understands exactly what weve been trying to say because sometimes we think weve been crystal clear but we know it can be subject to interpretation back in we did say we were interested in entering some new markets organically then the harris teeter opportunity came certainly put going into a new market organically on the back burner they had dc as a new market and we were learning a lot of how they went into that market as a new market organically before we were to go to one we continue to evaluate new markets organically what we have said since the harris teeter merger is thats put it on a little bit of a back burner with that opportunity and as i said earlier in the call when you have the opportunity to enter essentially two new markets now really three or four new markets when you look at the wisconsin market and you start out with a book of business of nearly billion the ebitda that they generate already while its new markets its new markets with a little bit of momentum and a base of business behind it where you dont start at zero and youre going to throw off losses for a while when you enter a new market so i honestly dont feel as though weve been inconsistent i think the conversation has been about whether theres an ma opportunity or whether we enter a new market organically i would say if anything entering a new market organically each time we do a merger like this probably slows that thought process down a little because we want to make sure the merger is successful but were not afraid to enter a new market via a merger like this aj jain okay that was very helpful and actually it did tie everything together i had one follow up so i understand that youre expecting this to be immediately accretive and so notwithstanding mike schlotman slightly slightly accretive dont get too far out there aj jain okay and you gave some guidance on the cost savings but im just wondering if it could have a dampening effect on comps and if that impact could be material since you mentioned its going to be much more of a fixer upper compared to harris teeter so im just wondering so much of a hit you could take on comps and if theres a need for heavy gross margin investment both near term and long term the kroger company november at a m eastern lastly if the million of benefits i just want to confirm if thats a net number after accounting for any incremental price investments that you might need to make thanks mike schlotman well the million would be gross synergies and relative to the effect on overall comps clearly those have been negative for a while and as we report these comps we havent talked about exactly how well do it its going to represent between and of our business so if theyre negative it may have a or basis point drag on my reported supermarket comps tim if you can check my math trying to do math on an iphone calculator and answer questions simultaneously im sure ive screwed it up so i dont think itll be a very big drag on the overall reported number and the whole goal here is to get their comps turned around and get them positive aj jain great thank you operator and the next question comes from stacie rabinowitz of consumer edge research stacie rabinowitz i was just curious with more stores in the chicago market and chicago being such a consolidated geography does that change how youre thinking about what you might be testing in e commerce and delivery versus pick up mike schlotman we have probably a test of everything going on in e commerce when you think about indiscernible cost and online ordering delivered to home via that way when you think about express lane at harris teeter click list at kroger or home delivery in the denver market so its safe to assume that we have things going on of all facets of this as rodney said at the investor conference a couple of weeks ago this isnt an or its not shop in the store or get home delivery we view it as and and we do believe we have to solve for how the customer wants to interact us on each shopping trip so if they want to come to the store today or if they want to drive by and have us put it in their cars or if they want it delivered to their home we believe we need to figure out a way to be able to address all of those needs for the customers stacie rabinowitz okay do you think that need for in home delivery is greater in chicago than some of the other areas you guys are currently in mike schlotman were not in chicago so i dont want to pretend i know the chicago market intimately obviously weve spent a lot of time there recently i would say that when you step back from it the higher use areas are denser urban markets like a new york like a philadelphia like a chicago so i would say thats something that well have bob help us understand what his customers and now our customers in chicago wants and needs are and try to figure out a way to offer that to them stacie rabinowitz thank you the kroger company november at a m eastern mike schlotman all right we have time for one more call operator okay that final question will come from joseph feldman of delsey advisory group joseph feldman hey guys thanks for taking the question most of mine were answered but i did want to follow up no something about the required investment for the stores that are up there it sounds like marianos are in very good shape but the wisconsin stores and can you talk about how soon youll get in there to really start ramping up the actual store experience and have you given thought to the level of expense that might be related to that mike schlotman well were formulating a pretty detailed plan of where we would want to go and how now that this has been announced well start meeting with bob and his team to formalize a joint plan we have a particular view perhaps of where we may want to go first we want to bounce that up against the people who have been running the stores and who know them better to make sure we havent missed the mark we certainly have the ability to quickly i believe quickly take their customer data run it through the logarithms that has and see what that tells us about where their pockets of the most loyal customers are that we would want to give a better shopping experience to so as all these different thoughts converge one of the reasons that we expect this to be only slightly accretive early on and we expect to reinvest a lot of these dollars is we would expect a fair amount of pace to this early on joseph feldman got it thats helpful and the rest of my questions were answered so thanks guys and good luck with it conclusion mike schlotman great thanks very much and as cindy said in her opening comments thanks for joining us on short notice and as always thanks for the support you all give us every day and i would like to close once again thanking all the veterans out there for their service to the country
