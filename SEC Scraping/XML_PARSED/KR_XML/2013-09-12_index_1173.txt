in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non

recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our lifo charge for the year will be affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of participants changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we
