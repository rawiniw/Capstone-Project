information currently available to it these statements are indicated by words such as expects will plans intends committed to and is our ability to achieve earnings per share growth rate expectations may be affected by labor disputes particularly as kroger seeks to manage health care and pension costs industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors the aggressiveness of competition and our response to these activities unexpected changes in product costs the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions as well as fuel and food prices the number of shares outstanding the success of our future growth plans goodwill impairment changes in government funded benefit programs volatility in our fuel margins the effect of fuel

payors and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores failure to achieve tonnage growth as expected or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our earnings targets earnings also may be affected by adverse weather conditions
