maintain a particular net total debt to ebitda ratio will be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to

the multi employer pension funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated likewise if health care expenses continue to grow at a faster pace than expected our incremental cost for those expenses will exceed our expectations the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation long term earnings per share growth and total shareholder return increasing dividend over time and our ability to reward shareholders through increased earnings per share quarterly dividends and share repurchases will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the ability for the company to pay dividends from free cash flow as contemplated our ability to expand non fuel fifo
