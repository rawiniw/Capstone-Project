financial statements of the plan are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america table of contents master trust the investments of the plan along with investments of other plans of the kroger co and its subsidiaries are pooled for investment purposes in a master trust pursuant to an agreement dated october between the northern trust company the trustee and the company the kroger defined contribution plan master trust the master trust investment valuation and income recognition the plans investments within the master trust are stated at fair value except for fully benefit responsive investment contracts which are reported at contract value fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the plans retirement management committee determines the plans valuation policies utilizing information provided by the investment advisors and custodian see note for discussion of fair value measurements purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis gains or losses on sales of securities are based on average cost dividends are recorded on the ex dividend date income from other investments is recorded as earned net depreciation includes the plans gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held during the year investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value except for fully benefit responsive investment contracts contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate a permitted transaction under the terms of the plan the plan invests in investment contracts through the master trust estimates the presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures actual results may differ from those estimates administrative expenses the plan will pay the administrative costs and expenses of the plan including the custodian and management fees any expenses that are unable to be allocated to participants are paid by the company and are excluded from these financial statements fees related to the administration of notes receivable from participants and distributions to participants are charged directly to the participants account and are included in administrative expenses table of contents subsequent events the company evaluates events and transactions occurring subsequent to the date of the financial statements for matters requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the accompanying financial statements consider events through the date on which the financial statements were available to be issued investment contracts the master trust holds several synthetic investment contracts which are managed by investment fund managers the key difference between a synthetic investment contract and a traditional investment contract is that the master trust holds the underlying assets in a synthetic investment contract the master trust also purchases wrapper contracts from financial institutions which provide assurance that crediting rates will never be less than zero all plans have an undivided interest in each investment contract the investment contracts are fully benefit responsive and are therefore reported at contract value a fully benefit responsive investment provides a liquidity guarantee by a financially responsible third party of principal and previously accrued interest for liquidations transfers loans or withdrawals initiated by plan participants under the terms of the ongoing plan certain employer initiated events i e layoffs mergers bankruptcy plan termination are not eligible for the liquidity guarantee in general issuers may terminate the investment contracts and settle at other than contract value if the qualification status of the employer or plan changes breach of material obligations under the contract and misrepresentation by the contract holder or failure of the underlying portfolio to conform to the pre established investment guidelines the plan administrator does not believe that the occurrence of any such event which would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with participants is probable table of contents master trust the following is

measurements for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value financial accounting standards board fasb defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about the fair value measurements the standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists fasb establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value into three levels level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk the assets fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs participants may direct their investments into kroger common stock retirement date funds or separately managed accounts the underlying investments in the retirement date funds and separately managed accounts include mutual funds common collective trusts and guaranteed investment contracts as described herein the retirement date funds and separately managed accounts are valued at nav as a practical expedient the following is a description of the valuation method used for assets measured at fair value there has been no change in the methodology used at december and common stock the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded the method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuation method is appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement table of contents while all the investments of the participating plans are deemed part of the master trust each plan does maintain a separate accounting of its share of the investments in the master trust the following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the master trusts assets at fair value as of

assets of the funds consist of mutual funds collective trusts and separate account vehicles with varying investment strategies the investments in the funds are reviewed regularly and adjusted as necessary b the primary objective of these funds is to provide an appropriate asset mix for a participant given the participants age and retirement year the underlying assets of the funds consist of mutual funds collective trusts and separate account vehicles as time moves closer to a participants retirement date the investments in the funds are adjusted automatically to become more conservative with a higher portion invested in bonds and shorter term investments and less in stocks the investments in the funds are reviewed regularly and adjusted as necessary the focus of the funds changes from growing assets to generating income and protecting investments as the retirement date approaches income tax status the plan obtained its latest determination letter dated july in which the internal revenue service irs stated that the plan as then designed complied with the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code irc although the plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter the plan administrator believes that the plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the irc therefore no provision for income taxes has been included in the plans financial statements table of contents risks and uncertainties the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market and credit risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits plan termination although it has not expressed any intent to do so the company has the right under the plan to terminate the plan at any time subject to the provisions of erisa in the event
