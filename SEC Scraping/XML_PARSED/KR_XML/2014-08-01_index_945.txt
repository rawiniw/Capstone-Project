acquisition corp defendants direct shareholder class action complaint for breach of fiduciary duties plaintiff john ernst plaintiff files this direct shareholder class action complaint against the herein named defendants and alleges as follows this is a direct shareholder action challenging the proposed takeover of boca raton florida based vitacost com inc vitacost or the company by the kroger co kroger for per share in cash via a tender offer the proposed takeover is the product of a fundamentally flawed process and a breach of the fiduciary duties vitacosts board of directors owe to vitacosts shareholders kroger plans to commence a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of vitacost per share provided that kroger obtains at least a majority of outstanding shares of vitacost in the tender offer any shares of vitacost common stock not acquired in the tender offer will be acquired by kroger in a subsequent short form merger to which non tendering shareholders will be involuntarily forced to accept per share holders of approximately of the outstanding shares of vitacost common stock have contractually agreed to support the transaction and tender their shares in the tender offer and it is more likely than not that or close to the majority necessary to complete the tender and effectuate a short form merger support the deal the transaction is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of however through the tender offer defendants are attempting to coerce plaintiff and the other public shareholders of vitacost into tendering their shares to kroger and accept the per share price as more fully set forth herein plaintiff seeks to enjoin the tender offer and subsequent merger as plaintiff and the putative class of vitacosts public shareholders face irreparable harm and have no adequate remedy at law jurisdiction and venue this court has jurisdiction over each defendant named herein because each defendant is either a corporation that conducts business in and maintains operations in this county or has sufficient minimum contacts with the state of florida so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction by the florida courts permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice venue is proper in this court because one or more of the defendants either resides in or maintains executive offices in this county a substantial portion of the transactions and wrongs complained of herein including the defendants primary participation in the wrongful acts detailed herein and aiding and abetting and conspiracy in violation of fiduciary duties owed to vitacost and its shareholders occurred in this county and defendants have received substantial compensation in this county by doing business here and engaging in numerous activities that had an effect in this county parties plaintiff is and has been the holder of shares of vitacost common stock at all relevant times defendant jeffrey j horowitz horowitz is and has been at all material times a director and the chief executive officer ceo of vitacost which post he has served as since february horowitz served as interim ceo and a director of vitacost from august through february prior to becoming interim ceo horowitz provided consulting services to vitacost horowitz is the founder of vitamin shoppe inc vitamin shoppe where he served in various management and board capacities for over years horowitz beneficially owns of vitacosts common stock defendant christopher s gaffney gaffney is and has been at all material times a director of vitacost which post he has served in since july gaffney is a managing partner with and one of the co founders of private equity firm great hill partners ghp the beneficial owner of nearly of vitacosts common stock gaffney was designated as a director of vitacost by ghp pursuant to the stockholder agreement between the company and ghp in defendant stuart goldfarb goldfarb is and has been at all material times a director of vitacost since february goldfarb also serves on the board of wwe inc a global entertainment and media company involved in the sport of professional wrestling defendant edwin j kozlowski kozlowski is and has been at all material times a director of vitacost since february defendant michael a kumin kumin is and has been at all material times a director and the interim chairman of the board of vitacost since july like defendant gaffney kumin is a managing partner with ghp the beneficial owner of nearly of vitacosts common stock kumin was designated as a director by ghp pursuant to the stockholder agreement between the company and ghp prior to joining ghp kumin held various executive and investing positions including roles at apollo management l p and goldman sachs l p defendant michael j mcconnell mcconnell is and has been at all material times a director of vitacost since march mcconnell has held various positions at pepsico merrill lynch and kidder peabody mcconnell was appointed to the board of directors in march pursuant to a standstill and nomination agreement between vitacost and shareholder osmium partners llc and affiliates osmium who is thus beholden to osmium defendant robert g trapp m d trapp is and has been at all material times a director of vitacost since april trapp has maintained a private practice in rheumatology in springfield illinois since defendant vitacost is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at broken sound blvd nw suite boca raton florida vitacosts stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq exchange under the ticker vitc according to the companys recent u s securities and exchange commission sec filings as of april there were over million shares of vitacost common stock outstanding defendant kroger is an ohio corporation with its principal place of business located in cincinnati ohio kroger is publicly traded on the nyse under the ticker kr kroger together with its subsidiaries operates as a retailer worldwide manufactures and processes food for sale in its supermarkets and operates retail food and drug stores multi department stores jewelry stores and convenience stores defendant vigor acquisition corp is a delaware corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of kroger and a vehicle through which the defendants seek to effectuate the proposed takeover the director defendants are collectively referred to herein as the individual defendants defendants kroger and vigor acquisition corp are collectively referred to as kroger all defendants are collectively referred to herein as the defendants class representation allegations plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action on behalf of all public holders of vitacost stock as of july the class excluded from the class are the defendants herein and any person firm trust corporation or other entity related to or affiliated with any of the defendants this action is properly maintainable as a class action under the florida rule of civil procedure the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law and fact which are common to the class and which predominate over questions affecting solely individual class members the common questions include a whether the individual defendants have breached their fiduciary duties of undivided loyalty independence or due care with respect to the plaintiff and the other members of the class in connection with the proposed takeover of vitacost by kroger b whether the individual defendants have breached their fiduciary duty to secure and obtain the best price reasonable under the circumstances for the benefit of the plaintiffs and the other members of the class in connection with the proposed takeover of vitacost by kroger c whether the individual defendants have breached any of their other fiduciary duties to plaintiff and the other members of the class in connection with the proposed takeover of vitacost by kroger including the duties of good faith diligence honesty and fair dealing d whether the individual defendants in bad faith and for improper motives have impeded or erected barriers to discourage other strategic alternatives including offers from interested parties for the company or its assets e whether plaintiff and the other members of the class would be irreparably harmed were the transactions complained of herein consummated and f whether vitacost and kroger are aiding and abetting the wrongful acts of the individual defendants plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the class and plaintiff does not have any interests adverse to the class plaintiff is an adequate representative of the class has retained competent counsel experienced in litigation of this nature and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class the prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class plaintiff anticipates that there will be no difficulty in the management of this litigation a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy the defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class with respect to the matters complained of herein thereby making appropriate the relief sought herein with respect to the class as a whole substantive allegations vitacost has tremendous potential for growth the wall street journal reported last year that s ales of vitamins minerals and supplements totaled nearly billion in the u s last year according to euromonitor international and are growing at a to annual clip indeed unlike virtually all other types of companies the vitamin business actually thrived through the economic recession because first some americans are focusing more on their health as they kick habits that are either bad or expensive or both theyre smoking less buying less soda and cutting back on calorie laden treats at starbucks and the convenience store vitamins and supplements are a key component of a healthier lifestyle second as americans lose health insurance and are confronted with the challenge of paying for prescriptions and medical treatment many of them may be trading down to vitamins and supplementsusing them as substitutes or alternatives and vitacost is a major player in the online vitamin space as the defendants have conceded vitacost is one of the largest pure ecommerce companies in the nutrition and healthy living market has a team with extensive ecommerce experience and has a http online wsj com news articles sb http www slate com articles business moneybox megavitamins html substantial platform that includes technology and ship to home fulfillment centers to serve customers in all states and internationally indeed despite several years of operating losses in the past seven months vitacost has outperformed the market generally and other companies in its peer group as reflected in the following chart on may vitacost announced its first quarter financials which reported among other things that the company reported record revenue of million the company reported a increase from total net sales for the first quarter of and shipped orders on the companys core vitacost com website increased year over year in the first quarter benefiting from the addition of new customers http investor vitacost com releasedetail cfm releaseid all points lead to continued growth by vitacost in the coming months and years as vitacost solidifies itself as a major player in the internet based dietary supplemental retail business in fact in march zacks equity research posted an article online about vitacosts growth potential stating it commonly happens in stock investing that investors miss the chance of buying winning stocks that they knew would stand out before they take the plunge others get to know the hidden potential and enter into these stocks pushing them out of reach so instead of repenting spotting the off the radar potential winners and immediately investing in them could be a smart decision one such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain but has been overlooked by investors lately is vitacost com inc vitc this services sector stock has actually seen loss estimates decrease over the past month for the current fiscal year by about but that is not yet reflected in its price as the stock gained only over the same time frame you should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward this years expected earnings growth over the prior year is which should ultimately translate into price appreciation and if this isnt enough vitc currently carries a zacks rank buy which further underscores the potential for its outperformance see the performance of zacks portfolios and strategies here about zacks performance so if you are looking for a stock flying under the radar that is well equipped to bounce down the road make sure to consider vitacost com solid estimate revisions and an impressive zacks rank suggest that better days may be ahead for vitc and that now might be an interesting buying opportunity months later on may defendant horowitz and the companys chief financial officer cfo both detailed the companys bright future during a conference call where they stated

shipped million orders from our vitacost com website up over last year average order value was approximately up year over year product aov was up year over year partially offset by a decline in shipping revenue as i mentioned earlier we added new customers to our vitacost com website down year over year and we ended the quarter with million active customers on vitacost com which was up year over year notwithstanding the companys undeniable growth potential two of vitacosts largest shareholders private equity shop consac llc consac and private equity firm osmium decided earlier this year that they each wanted a quick exit from vitacost however neither consac nor osmium could not simply dump their respective and holdings of vitacosts outstanding stock on the open market that would have obviously caused the companys stock to immediately decline and both consacs and osmiums profits would be significantly less accordingly on february consac filed a schedule d with the sec which stated among other things that i believe the only way to unlock this value for the shareholders is to put the company up for sale the companys market share and distribution network will be of interest to several significant industry players and other retailers who will be able to better leverage the companys strengths within a larger better capitalized entity i am not alone in thinking that the companys value significantly exceeds its current share price news reports indicate that similar concerns have recently been expressed publicly by another investor who owns approximately of the companys stock one week later vitacost issued this press release vitacost com evaluating strategic alternatives boca raton fla feb globe newswire vitacost com inc nasdaq vitc a leading online retailer

to the public announcement the takeover represents only a premium of to its closing price on tuesday july moreover on february imperial capital raised its prior price target for the company from per share to per share then on may imperial capital provided the following investment analysis regarding the company we have an outperform rating and a one year price target of on the shares of vitacost com inc vitc as the leading online retailer of vitamins minerals herbs and supplements vmhs and natural and organic food products vitc has built sizeable and leading health and nutrition e commerce platform vitcs iq results were weaker than expected on a softer vmhs category and heightened competition in the space the company took a small step backwards in tracking toward profitability and something to continue to monitor at x ev revenue we believe vitcs value is under appreciated by investors particularly in light of the lack of current earnings and the time it will take to achieve profitability that said we believe the company has size and scale that could be further leveraged by strategic players retailers in the vmhs space and broader natural organic food category there was no update on the boards review and evaluation of its strategic options our price target represents a forward ev revenue multiple of x which compares favorably to its most direct e commerce comparables trading at x forward revenue furthermore the individual defendants will enjoy self interested benefits that are unavailable to vitacost shareholders for instance not only will horowitz who is currently vitacosts ceo continue to run the company owned by kroger after the transaction is completed but he is set to receive significant change of control benefits worth well over one million dollars following the merger the fundamentally unfair merger and breach of fiduciary duties under applicable law in any situation where the directors of a publicly traded corporation undertake a transaction that will result in either i a change in corporate control or ii a breakup of the corporations assets the directors have an affirmative fiduciary obligation to obtain the highest value reasonably available for the corporations shareholders and if such transaction will result in a change of corporate control the shareholders are entitled to receive a significant premium to diligently comply with these duties the directors and or officers may not take any action that a adversely affects the value provided to the corporations shareholders b will discourage or inhibit alternative offers to purchase control of the corporation or its assets c contractually prohibits themselves from complying with their fiduciary duties d will otherwise adversely affect their duty to search and secure the best value reasonably available under the circumstances for the corporations shareholders and or e will provide the directors and or officers with preferential treatment at the expense of or separate from the public shareholders in accordance with their duties of loyalty and good faith the individual defendants as directors and or officers of vitacost are obligated under applicable law to refrain from a participating in any transaction where the directors or officers loyalties are divided b participating in any transaction where the directors or officers receive or are entitled to receive a personal financial benefit not equally shared by the public shareholders of the corporation and or c unjustly enriching themselves at the expense or to the detriment of the public shareholders the individual defendants are also obliged to honor their duty of candor to vitacosts shareholders by inter alia providing all material information to the shareholders regarding a scenario in which they must decide whether to vote or tender their shares or seek appraisal of their shares this duty of candor ensures that shareholders have all information that will enable them to make informed rational and intelligent decisions about whether to vote or tender their shares or seek appraisal of their shares the individual defendants have breached those fiduciary duties here the preclusive deal protection devices to exacerbate the harm from what appears to have been a flawed single bidder process the individual defendants agreed to preclusive deal protection devices that prevent vitacosts shareholders from receiving a higher offer than per share vitacost must pay kroger a termination fee if a topping bidder were to successfully offer more consideration than kroger which fees would have to be absorbed by the topping bidder this termination fee thus increases the price a topping bidder would have to pay but a topping bidder would be sufficiently deterred from even bidding in the first place the merger agreement precludes vitacost from soliciting topping bidders thus a topping bidder would have to emerge on its own if a topping bidder were to emerge and make a play for vitacost vitacost cannot even respond to the topping bidder for at least hours after providing notice to kroger when vitacost does respond the merger agreement requires vitacost to provide kroger with the name of the bidder and the information underlying the topping bidders proposal and to provide the same information provided to the topping bidder to kroger contemporaneously given the highly competitive nature of the industry these rapid information rights serve to dissuade a topping bidder as it will have to reveal business strategies and interests to kroger without any recourse or risk to kroger the merger agreement then provides kroger with a matching rights period that kroger can use to draw out a bidding process this dissuades potential topping bidders because of inter alia the cost of the time the topping bidder will spend during the matching rights process which process the topping bidder has no guarantee of winning to compound the problem the merger agreement further solidifies krogers grip on vitacost if a topping bidder makes its bid public in that scenario the merger agreement requires vitacosts board to publicly reconfirm its support of the takeover by kroger within five business days after a demand by kroger that vitacosts board do so thus not only does a topping bidder have to anticipate a drawn out matching rights process kroger can

revenue results of million marking a increase from total net sales of million for the first quarter of in addition the company added new customers in the first quarter of alone an increase of year over year despite these confident indications of future financial growth the board decided to sell the company for inadequate consideration thereby depriving vitacost public stockholders of the ability to enjoy the companys promising long term business prospects the proposed transaction fails to maximize stockholder value in a press release dated july vitacost announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with kroger pursuant to which kroger through merger sub will purchase all outstanding shares of vitacost for per share in cash or approximately million under the terms of the merger agreement kroger will commence a tender offer for all the outstanding shares of vitacost common stock any shares that are not acquired in the tender offer will be acquired pursuant to the top up option afforded kroger in the transaction and a subsequent merger under dgcl sec h given the companys ongoing strong performance and its ideal positioning for future growth the proposed merger consideration is inadequate and significantly undervalues the company analysts have recommended a median target price of per share and yahoo analysts list per share as a low target at least one wall street analysts has recommended a per share price target the proposed merger consideration also fails to adequately compensate vitacosts stockholders for the considerable synergies created by the merger the proposed transaction is a strategic acquisition for kroger designed to help kroger expand its supermarket empire into an online retail platform kroger stores currently offer only of the more than items vitacost sells online and vitacost sells in states and over countries globally that do not contain kroger stores following consummation of the proposed transaction kroger will also gain access to the rapidly growing million customer base that vitacost services in a joint public statement announcing the proposed transaction the companies acknowledged the value of vitacosts assets to kroger vitacost com brings to kroger its strong position as one of the largest pure ecommerce companies in the nutrition and healthy living market a team with extensive ecommerce experience and a substantial platform that includes technology and ship to home fulfillment centers to serve customers in all states and internationally vitacost com offers more than products including vitamins minerals herbs supplements sports nutrition beauty care products and natural and organic foods to approximately million active customers the company has more than associates and operates distribution centers in lexington nc and las vegas nv and a customer service center in lexington nc krogers chief financial officer michael schlotman also commented on the proposed transaction we see opportunities to integrate vitacosts platform with our existing digital footprint over time kroger could use the vitacost online retail platform to make even more products available for purchase online it fits incredibly well with our established digital capabilities and our goal of providing an omni channel experience where customers can shop with us whenever and however they want together we are a powerful combination blending the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience we look forward to closing this transaction and working together as exhibited by the companys stellar first quarter performance in and numerous recent accolades kroger is seeking to acquire the company at the most opportune time when the company is performing at record highs and positioned for continuing growth yet despite the companys impressive recent performance and potential particularly when viewed in conjunction with the obvious and significant synergies inherent in the transaction for kroger the board failed to capitalize on this value and secure a fair price for the company the unreasonable deal protection devices in addition as part of the merger agreement defendants agreed to certain onerous and unreasonable deal protection devices that operate conjunctively to make the proposed transaction a fait accompli and potentially preclude competing offers from emerging for the company section of the merger agreement includes a no solicitation provision barring the company from soliciting interest from other potential acquirers in order to procure a price in excess of the amount offered by kroger the company is also precluded by this section from providing any entity besides kroger access to non public information that may encourage a competitive alternative proposal section a further requires that the company terminate any and all prior or ongoing discussions with other potential acquirers and d includes a provision whereby the company may not waive any standstill or confidentiality agreement pursuant to c and e of the merger agreement should a bidder submit a bona fide written and unsolicited competing proposal the company must notify kroger of the bidders identity and the terms of the bidders offer thereafter in accordance with c the board must determine in good faith that the offer is a superior proposal to krogers bid and afford kroger at least hour notice of any intent to participate or engage in discussions with the unsolicited bidder if the board decides that the alternative proposal is a bona fide superior proposal e requires that the company must keep kroger informed as to the status and terms of any such discussions and provide kroger with copies of any additional written materials received relating to the alternative proposal in order words the merger agreement gives kroger access to any rival bidders confidential information and allows kroger to easily make a superior offer based on this information accordingly no rival bidder is likely to emerge and act as a stalking horse in light of the potential risks associated with disseminating a rival bidder confidential information and the ability of kroger to easily piggy back upon the due diligence of the foreclosed second bidder the merger agreement also provides that a termination fee of must be paid to kroger by vitacost if the company decides to pursue a competing offer thereby essentially requiring that a competing bidder agree to pay a naked premium for the right to provide the stockholders with a superior offer moreover in connection with proposed transaction certain vitacost stockholders have entered into support agreements in favor of the proposed transaction with kroger as of july at least million vitacost shares have been locked up in favor of the proposed transaction representing of the total shares outstanding most troubling of the million subject shares all are beneficially owned by or indirectly controlled by vitacosts executives and board of directors specifically defendant horowitz has entered into a support agreement to tender his personal shareholding of shares and also caused jhh capital a significant stockholder of which defendant horowitz is the lone managing partner to enter into a support agreement to tender additional shares similarly great hill investors llc great hill equity partners iii l p and great hill equity partners iv l p collectively great hill have each entered into support agreements to tender a collective shares great hill is a private equity company managed by chairman of the board kumin and board member gaffney section of the tender and support agreements requires a subject stockholder to abstain from voting shares in favor of any alternative proposal which would frustrate the proposed transaction and to further affirmatively vote against any such alternative proposal section further precludes any such stockholder from withdrawing shares in support of the tender offer until the offer expires or is terminated as executives and directors of vitacost defendants horowitz kumin and gaffney have an obligation to maximize stockholder value and pursue a transaction that is in the best interest of vitacost stockholders however by entering support agreements which lock up their significant investments in the company the defendants are now inherently conflicted because they have exposed themselves to potential financial and contractual liability if the proposed transaction is not consummated even if a the transaction is no longer in the best interest of stockholders ultimately these deal protection provisions unreasonably restrain the companys ability to solicit or engage in negotiations with any third party regarding a proposal to acquire all or a significant interest in the company the circumstances under which the board may respond to an unsolicited written bona fide proposal for an alternative acquisition that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a superior proposal are too narrowly circumscribed to provide an effective fiduciary out under the circumstances accordingly plaintiff seeks injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent the irreparable injury that company stockholders will continue to suffer absent judicial intervention claims for relief count i breach of fiduciary duties against all individual defendants plaintiff repeats all previous allegations as if set forth in full herein the individual defendants have violated their fiduciary duties owed to the public stockholders of vitacost and have acted to put their personal interests ahead of the interests of vitacost stockholders the individual defendants recommendation of the proposed transaction will result in a change of control of the company which imposes heightened judicial scrutiny of the boards process and its obligation to maximize vitacosts value for the benefit of the stockholders the individual defendants have breached their fiduciary duties owed to the stockholders of vitacost because among other reasons a they failed to take steps to maximize the value of vitacost to its public stockholders and took steps to avoid competitive bidding b they failed to properly value vitacost and c they ignored or did not protect against the numerous conflicts of interest resulting from the directors own interrelationships or connection with the proposed transaction count ii aiding and abetting against kroger and merger sub as a result of the individual defendants breaches of their fiduciary duties plaintiff and the class will suffer irreparable injury in that they have not and will not receive their fair portion of the value of vitacosts assets and will be deprived of the benefits of a value

herein as the individual defendants by virtue of their positions as directors and or officers of vitacost the individual defendants are in a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff and the other public stockholders of vitacost each of the individual defendants at all relevant times had the power to control and direct vitacost to engage in the misconduct alleged herein the individual defendants fiduciary obligations required them to act in the best interest of plaintiff and all vitacost stockholders each of the individual defendants owes fiduciary duties of loyalty good faith due care and full and fair disclosure to plaintiff and the other members of the class the individual defendants are acting in concert with one another in violating their fiduciary duties as alleged herein and specifically in connection with the proposed transaction plaintiff alleges herein that the individual defendants separately and together in connection with the proposed transaction violated and are

vitacost the class excluded from the class are defendants herein and any person firm trust corporation or other entity related to or affiliated with any defendant this action is properly maintainable as a class action the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable as of may there were approximately shares of vitacost common stock outstanding held by hundreds if not thousands of individuals and entities scattered throughout the country questions of law and fact are common to the class including among others i whether defendants have breached their fiduciary duties owed to plaintiff and the class and ii whether defendants will irreparably harm plaintiff and the other members of the class if defendants conduct complained of herein continues plaintiff is committed to prosecuting this action and has retained competent counsel experienced in litigation of this nature plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the class and plaintiff has the same interests as the other members of the class accordingly plaintiff is an adequate representative of the class and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class the prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the class would create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for defendants or adjudications that would as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of individual members of the class who are not parties to the adjudications or would substantially impair or impede those non party class members ability to protect their interests defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class as a whole and are causing injury to the entire class therefore final injunctive relief on behalf of the class is appropriate substantive allegations background of the company vitacost is a leading online retailer of health and wellness products

adjusted ebitda this quarter in addition we are proud to have been ranked by foresee research in overall customer satisfaction during the recent holiday period vitacost com has become the premier on

vitacost issued a press release wherein it announced its financial results for the first quarter ended march the company reported total net sales of million a increase from total net sales of million for the first quarter of shipped orders on the companys core vitacost com website increased year over year in the first quarter benefiting from the addition of new customers individual defendant horowitz commented in the first quarter we launched a national television advertising test and remain focused on increasing our reach to a wider base of customers in addition we released numerous new enhancements to our website to further improve the customer experience with many more to come throughout the year the flawed process leading up to the proposed transaction on november the board met and discussed exploring vitacosts strategic alternatives including a possible sale of the company following discussion the board directed its chairman individual defendant kumin and vitacosts management to identify and interview one or more financial advisors in connection with the boards strategic review between november and december kumin and members of vitacosts management interviewed several financial advisors including jefferies llc jefferies on december the board met and discussed vitacosts recent interactions with osmium an activist stockholder that was seeking an audience with the board to express their frustration with the board the board also discussed and approved engaging jefferies as vitacosts financial advisor thereafter as instructed by the board individual defendant horowitz and other members of vitacosts management with jefferies assistance identified third parties to be contacted to determine their potential interest in a transaction with vitacost on january the board met and again discussed vitacosts recent interactions with osmium after discussion the board authorized kumin to engage in discussions with osmium and then report to the board regarding a potential settlement agreement that would provide osmium with the ability to nominate a designee to the board in exchange for agreeing to certain standstill obligations eventually on march vitacost entered into a nomination and standstill agreement with john h lewis osmium osmium capital lp osmium capital ii lp osmium spartan lp osmium diamond lp collectively the osmium group the great hill group and individual defendant horowitz pursuant to which the osmium group agreed to certain standstill provisions and vitacost agreed to appoint and nominate one person designated by the osmium group the osmium designee to the board that same day vitacost increased the size of the board from six to seven members and appointed individual defendant mcconnell to the board as the osmium designee from january through march a total of twenty three strategic buyers and apparently no financial sponsors were contacted to gauge their interest in entering into discussions regarding a potential transaction with vitacost eleven of those parties expressed interest in pursuing discussions and entered into confidentiality agreements with vitacost the solicitation statement fails to disclose whether those confidentiality agreements contained standstill or dont ask dont waive dadw provisions however on march vitacost entered into a confidentiality agreement with kroger attached as exhibit d to the companys form sc to t filed with the sec on july which contains a standstill and dadw provision prohibiting kroger from among other things proposing to acquire the company or requesting a waiver or modification of any provision of the standstill paragraph for a period of two years thus it is likely that the confidentiality agreements entered into with the other eleven interested parties contain similar restrictive standstill and dadw provisions in mid february on behalf of vitacost a representative of jefferies contacted robert beyer beyer a director of kroger to gauge krogers interest in a potential transaction with vitacost beyer is also a director of the parent company of jefferies beyer directed the representative of jefferies to j michael schlotman schlotman krogers chief financial officer subsequently a representative of jefferies contacted schlotman who indicated that kroger would potentially be interested in a transaction with vitacost on february consac llc consac another activist stockholder and large vitacost stockholder issued a press release requesting that the board pursue a sale of the company on february executives from vitacost and a potential strategic counterparty party a met to discuss and share preliminary due diligence information also on february vitacost issued a press release announcing that it was exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives available to vitacost following the issuance of the press release in bound interest was received from another ten parties after discussion the board determined that none of these parties were credible alternatives during the month of march representatives of the company had preliminary due diligence discussions with representatives from party b party c and party d but each of these parties declined to continue discussions regarding a potential transaction with vitacost shortly thereafter for reasons undisclosed in the solicitation statement on april vitacost received a preliminary written proposal from party a to purchase all of vitacosts outstanding shares for to per share in cash on april vitacost received a preliminary written proposal from kroger to purchase all of vitacosts outstanding shares for to per share in cash on may kroger sent vitacost a revised proposal to purchase all of vitacosts outstanding shares for per share in cash on may the board met and jefferies informed the board that party a had indicated that its view of value was now below its previously indicated price range the board then reviewed and discussed krogers revised proposal which included a proposed day exclusivity period following discussion the board authorized jefferies to continue negotiations with kroger and provided guidance to jefferies regarding price and exclusivity negotiations with kroger on may the board met and jefferies informed the board that kroger indicated that it was willing to shorten its requested exclusivity period to thirty eight days following discussion the board determined to continue discussions with kroger regarding a potential transaction at its proposed price of per share and to provide kroger with an exclusivity period of up to thirty eight days at various times throughout the month of june representatives of vitacost and kroger negotiated the terms of the merger agreement ultimately the board agreed to several preclusive deal protection devices as discussed in more detail herein that effectively locked up the proposed transaction in favor of kroger incredibly the board apparently did not push kroger to raise its offer price once since it agreed to enter into the exclusivity period on may on july the board met and jefferies reviewed its financial analyses with the board and delivered its opinion that the per share merger consideration to be received by holders of vitacost shares was fair from a financial point of view to such holders after discussion the board approved the merger agreement later that day vitacost and kroger executed the merger agreement and certain stockholders of vitacost including several members of the board and their affiliated entities entered into the support agreements thereby locking up of the companys outstanding shares in favor of the proposed transaction the proposed transaction despite the companys prospects for future growth and success the company entered into the merger agreement on july pursuant to which parent through merger sub commenced the tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock for per share in cash the parties have agreed that if pursuant to delaware general corporation law section h section h after the purchase of the company common stock tendered in the tender offer kroger owns at least of the outstanding company common stock kroger will execute a short form merger which will not require the consent of the companys stockholders further the board also agreed to a top up option the top up option in section of the merger agreement that provides that kroger may purchase at a price per share equal to the merger consideration that number of shares necessary to obtain over of the outstanding shares of the company thus permitting kroger to complete a short form merger in the event that the proposed transaction cannot be effectuated under section h even more troubling is the fact that kroger can purchase those shares by paying in cash an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the top up option shares and by executing and delivering to the company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the remainder of such purchase price to the detriment of the companys stockholders the terms of the merger agreement substantially favor kroger and are calculated to unreasonably dissuade potential suitors from making competing offers for example the individual defendants have all but ensured that another entity will not emerge with a competing proposal by agreeing to a no solicitation provision in section of the merger agreement that prohibits the individual defendants from soliciting alternative proposals and severely constrains their ability to communicate and negotiate with potential buyers who wish to submit or have submitted unsolicited alternative proposals section b of the merger agreement states b subject to section c at all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this agreement pursuant to article ix and the acceptance time the company and its subsidiaries shall not nor shall they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective directors officers or other employees controlled affiliates or any investment banker attorney accountant or other authorized agent or representative retained by any of them collectively representatives to directly or indirectly i solicit initiate cause or induce the making submission or announcement of or knowingly encourage facilitate or assist an acquisition proposal ii furnish to any person other than parent acquisition sub or any designees of parent or acquisition sub any non public information relating to the company or any of its subsidiaries or afford to any person other than parent acquisition sub or any designees of parent or acquisition sub access to the business properties assets books records or other non public information or to any personnel of the company or any of its subsidiaries in any such case with the intent to induce the making submission or announcement of or the intent to encourage facilitate or assist an acquisition proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal iii participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or iv enter into any contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an acquisition transaction other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement additionally section a of the merger agreement states a the company and its subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any acquisition proposal and terminate such persons access to any data room containing the companys confidential information and shall request the return from all such persons or the destruction by such persons of all copies of confidential information previously provided to such persons by the company its subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to section d of the merger agreement the company shall not terminate amend or waive any standstill or other similar agreement entered into with any other party other than kroger specifically section d states d neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries shall terminate amend modify or waive any rights under or release any person other than parent and acquisition sub from any standstill or other similar agreement between the company or any of its subsidiaries on the one hand and such person on the other unless the company board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties further pursuant to section e of the merger agreement the company must advise kroger of any proposals or inquiries received from other parties including inter alia the material terms and conditions of the proposal and the identity of the party making the proposal section e of the merger agreement states e in addition to the obligations of the company set forth in section b the company shall promptly notify parent if any director or executive officer of the company becomes aware of any receipt by the company of i any acquisition proposal ii any request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or iii any inquiry with respect to or which would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal the terms and conditions of such acquisition proposal request or inquiry and the identity of the person or group making any such acquisition proposal request or inquiry and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such person relating to such acquisition proposal the company shall keep parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such acquisition proposal request or inquiry and the company shall provide parent with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such acquisition proposal inquiry or request moreover the merger agreement contains a highly restrictive fiduciary out provision permitting the board to withdraw its approval of the proposed transaction under extremely limited circumstances and grants kroger a matching right with respect to any superior proposal made to the company section c of the merger agreement provides c notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section or elsewhere in this agreement at any time prior to the acceptance time and after providing parent not less than hours written notice of its intention to take such actions if the company receives from any person a bona fide written and unsolicited acquisition proposal not involving a breach of this agreement or the confidentiality agreement that the company board determines in good faith after consultation with the companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel either constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal the company board may directly or indirectly through the companys representatives i participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and or ii furnish to such person any non public information relating to the company or any of its subsidiaries and or afford such person access to the business properties assets books records or other non public information or the personnel of the company or any of its subsidiaries in each case under this clause ii pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement provided that contemporaneously with furnishing any non public information to such person the company furnishes such non public information to parent to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the company to parent provided however that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding clauses i or ii a the company board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and b the company gives parent written notice of the identity of such person a copy of the acceptable confidentiality agreement entered into with such person the material terms of such acquisition proposal and of the companys intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with or furnish non public information to such person and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such person relating to such acquisition proposal without limiting the foregoing it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the companys subsidiaries or representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this section by the company further locking up control of the company in favor of kroger is section of the merger agreement which contains a provision for a termination fee of million payable by the company to kroger if the individual defendants cause the company to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to the lawful exercise of their fiduciary duties additionally the company entered into the support agreements with certain board members and their controlled entities specifically the company entered into support agreements with individual defendant horowitz and jhh capital which is a large company stockholder and is managed by horowitz further the company entered into support agreements with the great hill group entities which are managed by individual defendants kumin and gaffney collectively horowitz jhh capital and the great hill group own of the companys stock including the company shares owned by kroger of the companys stock is already locked up in favor of the proposed transaction as mentioned herein the solicitation statement states that the company entered into confidentiality agreements with eleven parties that expressed an interest in acquiring the company but it does not disclose whether those confidentiality agreements contained standstill or dadw provisions however given the fact that the confidentiality agreement entered into with kroger on march contains a standstill and dadw provision prohibiting kroger from among other things proposing to acquire the company or requesting a waiver or modification of any provision of the standstill paragraph for a period of two years it is likely that the confidentiality agreements entered into with the other eleven interested parties contain similarly restrictive provisions thus the board used these preclusive dadw agreements to handcuff the eleven interested parties from the very outset rather than using them to extract best and final offers from a few select bidders at the end of the sales process as they should be used even more problematic is the fact that the board agreed to section d of the merger agreement which provides that the company shall not terminate amend or waive any standstill or other similar agreement entered into with any other party other than kroger thus the eleven parties that expressed interest in acquiring the company are contractually prohibited from asking for a waiver of their standstill agreement and the board is contractually prohibited from waiving those agreements moreover under section b of the merger agreement the board may not solicit bids from new or previously contacted parties thus the board contractually prohibited itself from obtaining the highest price reasonably available for the companys stockholders as it was required to do or at the very least prohibited itself from becoming informed about the companys value in the market place as if that was not enough the board entered into the day exclusivity agreement with kroger on may thereby prohibiting the board from speaking with other interested parties including party a which submitted an offer to acquire the company this was also problematic considering that the company engaged in wholly inadequate market check prior to entering into the exclusivity agreement which resulted in the company contacting no financial sponsors and produced only one other initial bid from party a by agreeing to all of the deal protection devices the likely dadw agreements the support agreements and the exclusivity agreement with kroger the individual defendants have locked up the proposed transaction and have precluded other bidders from making successful competing offers for the company furthermore the merger consideration to be paid to plaintiff and the class in the proposed transaction is unfair and inadequate because among other things the intrinsic value of the company is materially in excess of the amount offered in the proposed transaction accordingly the proposed transaction will deny class members their right to share proportionately and equitably in the true value of the companys valuable and profitable business and future growth in profits and earnings as mentioned above the company has been performing well recently moreover the companys stock price traded as high as per share in the last weeks or over higher than the merger consideration further analysts have set a mean target price for the company of per share and one analyst set a price target of per share furthermore the merger consideration fails to adequately compensate the companys stockholders for the significant synergies created by the merger according to rodney mcmullen parents ceo we are delighted to welcome vitacost com to the kroger family vitacost coms talented team has built an exceptional online retail destination in the growing nutrition and wellness market with an enviable technology and fulfillment infrastructure this merger is in line with our growth strategy to enter new markets and new channels and along with harris teeters online order and pick up service accelerates our efforts to provide

position in the online nutrition market at the same time we will build on vitacost coms ecommerce platform by integrating it with our existing digital offerings to create exciting new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers as a result the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties that they owe to the companys public stockholders because the stockholders will not receive adequate or fair value for their vitacost common stock in the proposed transaction the materially incomplete and misleading solicitation statement defendants filed the solicitation statement with the sec in connection with the proposed transaction as alleged below and elsewhere herein the solicitation statement omits material information that must be disclosed to vitacosts stockholders to enable them to render an informed decision with respect to the proposed transaction the solicitation statement omits material information with respect to the process and events leading up to the proposed transaction as well as the opinions and analyses of vitacosts financial advisor jefferies this omitted information if disclosed would significantly alter the total mix of information available to vitacosts stockholders for example the solicitation statement fails to disclose whether the confidentiality agreements entered into with the eleven parties that expressed an interest in acquiring the company contained standstill or dadw provisions and if so the solicitation statement must explain the significance of those provisions as mentioned the confidentiality agreement entered into with kroger contained standstill and dadw provisions prohibiting kroger from among other things proposing to acquire the company or requesting a waiver or modification of any provision of the standstill paragraph for a period of two years moreover section d of the merger agreement provides that the company shall not terminate amend or waive any standstill or other similar agreement thus it is likely that the confidentiality agreements entered into with the other eleven interested parties contain similarly restrictive standstill and dadw provisions and the disclosure of these provisions is highly material to the company stockholders the solicitation statement states that in mid february a representative of jefferies contacted beyer who is a director of kroger and a director of the parent company of jefferies to gauge krogers interest in a potential transaction with vitacost the solicitation statement however fails to adequately disclose the relationship financial or otherwise between beyer jefferies and kroger and whether any inside information about vitacost was shared with kroger prior to it executing a confidentiality agreement with the company the solicitation statement fails to disclose whether jefferies has acted as a financial advisor for or provided financial services to kroger in the past and if so how much compensation jefferies received for those services the solicitation statement fails to disclose the nature of vitacosts recent interactions with osmium in december and january prior to the osmium group entering into the nomination and standstill agreement with the company that resulted in individual defendant mcconnell being nominated to the board on march the solicitation statement fails to disclose whether the board or its representatives contacted any of its large stockholders including osmium and consac to determine whether they were interested in a potential transaction with the company the solicitation statement fails to disclose whether representatives from vitacost engaged in discussions with consac after it issued a press release requesting that the board pursue a sale of the company as the board did with osmium when osmium expressed its dissatisfaction with the board the solicitation statement states that f rom january through march a total of strategic buyers were contacted to gauge their interest in entering into discussions regarding a potential transaction with vitacost it is apparent that vitacost and jefferies chose not to solicit interest from any financial sponsors the solicitation statement fails to disclose the boards reason for failing to do so the solicitation statement fails to disclose the reasons party b party c and party d gave for declining to pursue a transaction with the company with respect to jefferies selected public companies analysis the solicitation statement is materially misleading in that it fails to disclose the company by company pricing multiples and financial and operating metrics related to size growth prospects profitability and operational risk and whether other multiples were examined for vitacost further the solicitation statement states that financial data for vitacost was based in part on wall street research estimates but the solicitation statement fails to disclose which exact estimates were relied upon and it fails to provide a fair summary of those estimates with respect to jefferies selected precedent transactions analysis the solicitation statement is materially misleading in that it fails to disclose the transaction by transaction enterprise values and pricing multiples and whether other multiples were examined with respect to jefferies discounted cash flow analysis the solicitation statement is materially misleading in that it fails to i identify quantify and source the assumptions underlying the wacc ii the individual inputs and assumptions that jefferies used for the selection of discount rates of to and iii the individual inputs and assumptions that jefferies used for the selection of the perpetuity growth rates of to with respect to vitacosts financial forecasts the solicitation statement states that vitacost management prepared financial forecasts in connection with the boards strategic review process the solicitation statement however fails to disclose whether company management prepared financial forecasts in the ordinary course of business and if so the solicitation statement fails to disclose a fair summary of those forecasts count i breach of fiduciary duties against the individual defendants plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding allegations as if fully set forth herein as members of the companys board the individual defendants have fiduciary obligations to a undertake an appropriate evaluation of vitacosts net worth as a merger acquisition candidate b take all appropriate steps to enhance vitacosts value and attractiveness as a merger acquisition candidate c act independently to protect the interests of the companys public stockholders d adequately ensure that no conflicts of interest exist between the individual defendants own interests and their fiduciary obligations and if such conflicts exist to ensure that all conflicts are resolved in the best interests of vitacosts public stockholders e actively evaluate the proposed transaction and engage in a meaningful auction with third parties in an attempt to obtain the best value on any sale of vitacost and f disclose all material information to the companys stockholders the individual defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiff and the class as alleged herein the individual defendants have initiated a process to sell vitacost that undervalues the company in addition by agreeing to the proposed transaction the individual defendants have capped the price of vitacost at a price that does not adequately reflect the companys true value the individual defendants also failed to sufficiently inform themselves of vitacosts value or disregarded the true value of the company furthermore any alternate acquiror will be faced with engaging in discussions with a management team and board that are committed to the proposed transaction as such unless the individual defendants conduct is enjoined by the court they will continue to breach their fiduciary duties to plaintiff and the other members of the class plaintiff and the members of the class have no adequate remedy at law count ii breach of fiduciary duty of disclosure against the individual defendants plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding allegations as if fully set forth herein the individual defendants have caused materially misleading and incomplete information to be disseminated to the companys public stockholders the individual defendants have an obligation to be complete and accurate in their disclosures the solicitation statement fails to disclose material information including financial information and information necessary to prevent the statements contained therein from being misleading the misleading omissions and disclosures by defendants concerning information and analyses presented to and considered by the board and its advisors affirm the inadequacy of disclosures to the companys stockholders because of defendants failure to provide full and fair disclosure plaintiff and the class will be stripped of their ability to make an informed decision with respect to the proposed transaction and thus are damaged thereby plaintiff and the members of the class have no adequate remedy at law count iii aiding and abetting the boards breaches of fiduciary duties against vitacost and kroger plaintiff repeats and realleges the preceding allegations as if fully set forth herein defendants vitacost and kroger knowingly assisted the individual defendants breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction which without such aid would not have occurred in connection with discussions regarding the proposed transaction vitacost provided and kroger obtained sensitive non public information concerning vitacost and thus had unfair advantages that are enabling it to pursue the proposed transaction which offers unfair and inadequate consideration as a result of this conduct plaintiff and the other members of the class have been and will be damaged in that they have been and will be prevented from obtaining fair consideration for their vitacost shares plaintiff and the members of the class have no adequate remedy at law prayer for relief wherefore plaintiff prays for judgment and relief as follows a ordering that this action may be maintained as a class action and certifying plaintiff as the class representative and plaintiffs counsel as class counsel b preliminarily and permanently enjoining defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with consummating or closing the proposed transaction c in the event defendants consummate the proposed transaction rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages to plaintiff and the class d directing defendants
