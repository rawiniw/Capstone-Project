analysis of sales for each year presented also please clarify your disclosure regarding the reasons for the change in total sales for the most recent year since it appears that a decline in retail fuel prices would not have the effect of increasing total sales in addition it would be useful to investors to understand a the effect of changes in transaction counts and average sale per shopping trip in your analysis of identical supermarket sales excluding fuel b the reasons for the changes in the retail price of fuel and c the effect of the change in retail square footage further since you include both identical and comparable supermarket sales in your discussion please discuss both of these operating metrics in your analysis finally please provide a discussion and analysis of other

will be made between and and between and comparable to the following the slight increase in total sales for compared to was attributable to our increase in identical sales offset by our year over year decline in supermarket fuel sales of approximately total supermarket fuel sales declined over the same period due to a decline in retail fuel prices of approximately offset partially by a increase in gallons sold retail fuel prices decreased by approximately year over year in compared to due to deflation in the product cost of fuel the increase in total supermarket sales without fuel for over was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales of as well as an increase in supermarket square footage of identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip comparable store sales represent approximately of total supermarket sales for and so we do not believe that it is useful for us to differentiate between total supermarket sales and comparable store sales the change in other sales is not material to krogers financial statements therefore additional discussion is not meaningful to investors and is unwarranted liquidity and capital resources page we note the disclosure on page that you believe cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including
