affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares pay dividends and fund capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our

investments could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if economic conditions fail to improve or worsen during the first three quarters of the year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our lifo charge for the year will be affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plan and length of service of participants changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase section
