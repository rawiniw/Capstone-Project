contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares pay dividends and fund capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our ability to achieve

during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement plans will depend on the number of participants savings rate compensation as defined by the plans and length of service of participants changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross margins decline as
