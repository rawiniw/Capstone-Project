increased the dividend each year and expects to continue to do so while achieving a leverage ratio that will permit it to maintain its current debt rating our ability to increase return on invested

increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores failure to achieve tonnage growth or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition and sales shifts to other stores that we operate as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products and the effect that increased numbers of generic pharmaceuticals which generally carry lower retail prices than brands have on our sales earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation and the benefits that we receive from the consolidation of the ufcw pension plans our guidance for lifo is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our non fuel fifo operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected our capital expenditures our plan to increase capital expenditures and the number of projects that we complete could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores development costs vary from those budgeted our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing of completion of projects our plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures repurchase shares pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating will depend on our ability to generate free cash flow and otherwise to have cash on hand which will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the extent to which funds can be used for those reasons while maintaining our debt rating any change in tax laws the regulations related thereto the applicable accounting rulesor standards or the interpretation thereof by federal state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate should asset values in the multi employer pension funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated likewise if health care expenses continue to grow at a faster pace than expected our incremental cost for those expenses will exceed our expectations the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation long term earnings per share growth and total shareholder return and our ability to reward shareholders through increased earnings per share quarterly dividends and share repurchases will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the ability for the company to pay dividends from free cash flow as
