million to multi employer pension funds labor in we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in southern california memphis and west virginia and with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the midwest negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting

approximately to krogers goal is to produce an average annual return for shareholders that matches or exceeds the sp index over the time horizon described above but with less volatility our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals as well as the timing that those earnings occur within the year may be affected by labor disputes particularly as the company seeks to manage health care and pension costs industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors our response to these actions unexpected changes in product costs the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions as well as rising fuel and food prices the number of shares outstanding the success of our future growth plans goodwill impairment volatility in our fuel margins increased fuel costs and the effect those incr eases have on consumer spending and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores failure to achieve tonnage growth as expected or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition and sales shifts to other stores that we operate as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplyin g energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation our guidance for lifo is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our non fuel operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected our capital expenditure s and the number of projects that we complete could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores development costs vary from those budgeted our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing of completion of projects our plans to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures repay debt repurchase shares pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating will depend on our ability to generate free cash flow and otherwise to have cash on hand which will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the extent to which funds can be used for those reasons while maintaining our debt rating although we believe that our expected reduced capital expenditures should provide for sufficient cash flow to permit us to execute our strategy any cash flow shortfall could have an effect on our ability to do so if our expectation of fuel margins which are unpredictable is inaccurate we could fail to achieve our anticipated earnings per share growth any change in tax laws the regulations related thereto the applicable accounting rulesor standards or the interpretation thereof by federal state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate should asset values in the multi employer pension funds further deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated likewise if health care expenses continue to grow at a faster pace than expected our incremental cost for those expenses will exceed our expectations the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation our ability to achieve operating margins comparable to could be affected by all of the factors outlined above that could cause us to fail to achieve our expected earnings and earnings per share growth section financial statements and exhibits item financial statements and exhibits d exhibits earnings release for fourth
