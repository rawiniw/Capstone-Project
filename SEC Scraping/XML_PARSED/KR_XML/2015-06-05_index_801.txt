but is made voluntarily in the interest of public disclosure and consideration of these important issues shareholder proposal no on the kroger co s proxy statement options to reduce or eliminate routine antibiotic use in the production of private label meats the routine and excessive use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry production is a major driver behind the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria an increasingly urgent public health and food safety risk administrating antibiotics to food animals on a routine basis for non targeted purposes such as to promote faster growth rather than targeted to treat specific cases of illness creates conditions for bacteria to become resistant to these antibiotics responding to consumer demand and the growing public health risks associated with this practice major companies have adopted policies aimed at reducing the routine use of antibiotics in food animal production these policies are illustrative of a precautionary and pro active approach to food safety that goes beyond current regulations governing antibiotic use for food animal production current regulations are in the proponents view insufficient to protect consumers and our company against the risks associated with selling meat produced using excessive antibiotic administration kroger is one of the largest supermarket chains in the nation with perishable food including meat and deli items accounting for around of the companys revenue in meaning that food safety and quality trends should be of top priority to the company in contrast to other companies kroger has not articulated a policy for reducing consumer exposure to meat produced under routine antibiotic administration and faces business and reputational risks that could put the company at a competitive disadvantage as a result consequently shareholders are being asked to vote for shareholder proposal requesting that our company undertake and publish a study of policy options to reduce or eliminate routine antibiotic use in the production of meat sold under krogers private label brands this is not a solicitation of authority to vote your proxy please do not send us your proxy card green century capital management inc is not able to vote your proxies nor does this communication contemplate such an event green century capital management inc urges shareholders to vote for item number following the instruction provided on the managements proxy mailing rationale for a yes vote the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria or superbugs has become a public health crisis and is attributed in part to the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production current regulations governing antibiotic use in the u s are in the proponent s opinion insufficient to protect the company from business risks associated with selling meat produced using excessive routine antibiotic administration responding to public and consumer concern about excessive routine antibiotic use in food animal production several major companies including a kroger competitor have publicly adopted policies against purchasing meat produced under excessive antibiotic use heightening the risks of inaction for kroger background kroger is one of the largest supermarket chains in the nation with perishable food including meat and deli items accounting for around of the companys revenue in for these reasons proponents contend the company faces significant financial and reputational risks if it is unable to meet consumer expectations for food quality and safety in meat production or is forced to recall its products due to outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria contaminating the meat sold under krogers private label brand responding to consumer demand and a growing public health crisis major actors in the food industry have taken actions that will reduce the routine use of antibiotics on livestock and poultry for example chipotle chik fil a whole foods panera bread mcdonalds and wal mart have all adopted policies aimed at restricting the excessive use of antibiotics to produce the meat they sell major meat suppliers including perdue farms tyson foods pilgrims pride and most recently foster farms have also recently made commitments to reduce or eliminate the routine use of antibiotic on chickens demonstrating that meat can be produced on a large scale without overusing antibiotics in addition to responding to consumer demand the public health rationale for these actions is compelling currently kroger does not appear to have policies in place to reduce or eliminate routine antibiotic use in the production of its private label brand meats and may be exposed to significant business risks as a result rationale for a yes vote the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria or superbugs has become a public health crisis and is attributed in part to the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production superbugsbacteria immune or resistant to one or more antibioticsinfect over million people in the u s and kill over annually according to the centers for disease control and prevention an important cause of antibiotic resistant bacteria is the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production for the routine non therapeutic purposes of promoting faster growth or preventing instead of treating illness in the u s more than by volume of medically important those used to treat human illness antibiotics are sold for use on food animals speaking to congress in the cdc fda and department of agricultureall testified to a linkbetween the non therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal agriculture and antibiotic resistant bacterial infections in humans calls to restrict or ban the routine use of medically important antibiotics for food producing animals have been endorsed by the american medical association american public health association and other leading health organizations the world health organization has warned that the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria could lead to a post antibiotic erain which common infections and minor injuries can kill and which threatens the achievements of modern medicine http www

feabdc html current regulations governing antibiotic use in the u s are in the proponent s opinion insufficient to protect the company from business risks associated with selling meat produced using excessive antibiotics administered to food animals kroger faces significant business risks for failing to go beyond compliance to meet growing public expectations for food quality and safety as evidenced by the high profile coverage in prominent media outlets concerning the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria the public is becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about this issue eating food contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria is one way in which superbugs can be transmitted from a farm to human population government testing of raw supermarket meat detected superbug versions of salmonella e coli or other bacteria in of ground turkey of ground beef and of chicken sampled an outbreak of antibiotic resistant salmonella from chicken produced by foster farms last year resulted in more than known illnesses several kroger private brand chicken products were recalled by foster farms as part of this outbreak posing risks to krogers reputation and consumers safety consumer reports in a survey found of people were extremely or very concerned about widespread use of antibiotics in animal feed this year research firm midan marketing surveyed grocery shoppers and found aware of antibiotic use in animals and concerned about it in its opposition statement kroger acknowledges that many of its customers have indicated a preference for antibiotic free meat items and that sales of their products labeled as antibiotic free have increased significantly in recent years and are projected to continue increasing indicating clear consumer concern and attention to this issue recognizing the public health risks associated with the routine use of antibiotics in food animal production the fda recently enacted a guidance to the industry aimed at curbing this practice while this guidance indicates that the issue has risen to the level of regulatory concern and scrutiny the guidance is currently voluntary meaning that companies cannot rely on the current regulatory framework to protect against the public health safety reputational and financial risks associated with selling meat produced under these conditions industry peers and competitors are responding to public health concerns by voluntarily adopting policies to restrict excessive antibiotic use in their meat supply chains heightening the risks of inaction for kroger responding to public concerns about the excessive use of antibiotics in food animal production a growing number of companies including chipotle chik fil a whole foods panera bread mcdonalds and wal mart have adopted policies aimed at restricting the excessive use of antibiotics to produce the meat they sell several major meat producers have announced that they will begin curbing antibiotic use in food animal production demonstrating that meat can be produced on a large scale without overusing antibiotics for example perdue foods announced that it has entirely phased out routine antibiotic use in the production of its chicken meat and tyson foodsthe largest u s poultry producer said it was working to do the same conclusion http www nytimes com opinion sunday the rise of antibiotic

htm proponents contend that krogers current standards governing sales of meat sold under its private label brands does not keep it far enough ahead of emerging food safety concerns and standards while kroger argues that offering a limited antibiotic free product line is sufficient to address this growing consumer and public health concern proponents believe that failure to adopt a more comprehensive policy to reduce or eliminate excessive antibiotic use across all meats sold under its private label brand leaves the company exposed to significant financial competitive and reputational risks as a result as one of the largest supermarket chains in the nation with significant sales coming from food animal products kroger should be more proactive in restricting excessive antibiotic use to produce its private label meats we believe it is in the companys best interest to study policy options for reducing or eliminating routine antibiotic use in the production of its private label brand meats which would help meet consumer expectations mitigate reputational risk and safeguard against potential financial losses this is not a solicitation of authority to vote your
