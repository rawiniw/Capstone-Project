investment valuation and income recognition investments within the master trust in common stocks mutual funds collective trusts and investment contracts are valued at fair value based on quoted market prices fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date see note for discussion of fair value measurements purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis gains or losses on sales of securities are based on average cost dividends are recorded on the ex dividend date income from other investments is recorded as earned investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate a permitted transaction under the terms of the plan the plan invests in investment contracts through the master trust the statement of net assets available for benefits presents the fair value of the investment in the master trust as well as the adjustment of the investment in the master trust from fair value to contract value relating to investment contracts the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits is prepared on a contract value basis effective with the plan year ended december the plan elected to adopt the new standard which requires that participant loans be classified as notes receivable from the participants the loans are segregated from plan investments and are measured at their

accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures actual results may differ from those estimates administrative

benefit responsive investment provides a liquidity guarantee by a financially responsible third party of principal and previously accrued interest for liquidations transfers loans or withdrawals initiated by plan participants under the terms of the ongoing plan certain employer initiated events i e layoffs mergers bankruptcy plan termination are not eligible for the liquidity guarantee in general issuers may terminate the investment contracts and settle at other than contract value if the qualification status of the employer or plan changes breach of material obligations under the contract and misrepresentation by the contract holder or failure of the underlying portfolio to conform to the pre established investment guidelines the plan administrator does not believe that the occurrence of any such event which would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with participants is probable table of contents the following information relates to the master trust interest in investment contracts contract value fair value crediting interest rate range to to current crediting rate average yield the crediting interest rate range for the investment contracts is

investment results of the plan may not reflect its proportionate interest in the master trust table of contents fair value measurements for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value generally accepted accounting principles define fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists generally accepted accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value into three levels level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk the assets fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the following is a description of the valuation methods used for assets measured at fair value there have been no changes in methodologies used at december and cash the carrying value approximates fair value common stocks the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded mutual funds the fair values of these securities are primarily based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded guaranteed investment contracts the investments include cash and cash equivalents fixed maturity guaranteed investment contracts gics and constant duration gics the fair value of the investments are calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable duration wall street journal gic index rates fair values for variable synthetic gics are calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable swap rates fair values for constant duration synthetic gics are calculated using the market values table of contents provided by the external investment managers collective trusts the collective trust funds are public investment vehicles valued using a net asset value nav provided by the manager of each fund the nav is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding the navs unit price is quoted on a private market that is not active however the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund which are traded on an active market and valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded the significant investment strategies of the funds are as described in the financial statements provided by each fund there are no restrictions on redemptions from these funds retirement date funds retirement date funds are made up of investments in mutual funds and fixed income investments and are valued in a manner consistent with that described above the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuations methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement while all the investments of the participating plans are deemed part of the master trust each plan does maintain a separate accounting of its share of the investments in the master trust which is reflected below table of contents the following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the master

not yet received a response the plan administrator believes that the plan currently is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code irc therefore no provision of income taxes has been included in the plans financial statements accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the plan and recognize a tax liability or asset if the plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service the plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or asset or disclosure in the financial statements the plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions however there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress plan years through remain open to income tax examinations table of contents risks and uncertainties the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market and credit risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the statement of net assets available for benefits plan termination although it has not expressed any intent to do so the company has the right under the plan to terminate the plan at any time subject to the provisions of erisa
