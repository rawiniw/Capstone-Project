compensationconsultants the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers in kroger paid that consultant for work conducted for the committee kroger on managements recommendation retained the parent and affiliated companies of mercer human resource consulting to perform other services for kroger in for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to insurance claims for which kroger was reimbursed by insurance carriers as claims were adjusted insurance brokerage and bonding commissions and pension consulting kroger also made payments to affiliated companies for insurance premiums that were collected by the affiliated companies on behalf of insurance carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the committee nor the board expressly approved the other services the committee determined that the consultant is independent because a he was first engaged by the committee before he became associated with mercer b he works exclusively for the committee and not for our management c he does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and d neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services on behalf of kroger in the compensation committee also directly engaged a second compensation consultant from frederick w cook co inc to review krogers executive compensation the committee determined that the consultant is independent because neither he nor his company provide any other services for kroger boardoversightof enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board of directors is responsible for the overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the boards audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control that exposure the audit committee also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective committees regarding the management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board in addition to the reports from the committees the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo addresses matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by an independent lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr dillon as chairman and ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls boardleadershipstructure our board is composed of twelve independent directors and two management directors mr dillon the chairman of the board and ceo and mr mcmullen president and chief operating officer in addition as provided in our guidelines on issues of corporate governance the board has designated one of the independent directors as lead director the board has established five standing committees audit compensation corporate governance financial policy and public responsibilities each of the board committees is composed solely of independent directors each with a different independent director serving as committee chair we believe that the mix of experienced independent and management directors that make up our board along with the independent role of our lead director and our independent board committees benefits kroger and its shareholders the board believes that it is beneficial to kroger and its shareholders to designate one of the directors as a lead director the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving board agendas meeting materials and schedules to confirm the appropriate topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each serving as liaison between the chairman of the board management and the non management directors presiding at the executive sessions of independent directors and at all other meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present and calling an executive session of independent directors at any time bobby shackouls an independent director and the chair of the corporate governance committee is currently our lead director mr shackouls is an effective lead director for kroger due to among other things his independence his deep strategic and operational understanding of kroger obtained while serving as a kroger director his corporate governance knowledge acquired during his tenure as a member of our corporate governance committee his previous experience on other boards and his prior experience as a ceo of a fortune company with respect to the roles of chairman and ceo the guidelines provide that the board believes that it is in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders for one person to serve as chairman and ceo the board recognizes that there may be circumstances in which it is in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders for the roles to be separated and the board exercises its discretion as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances the board believes that the combination or separation of these positions should continue to be considered as part of the succession planning process as was the case in when the roles were separated since the roles have been combined our board and each ofits committees conduct an annual evaluation to determine whether they are functioning effectively as part of this annual self evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders our guidelines provide the flexibility for our board to modify our leadership structure in the future as appropriate we believe that kroger like many u s companies has been well served by this flexible leadership structure compensationdiscussion andanalysis executivecompensation general principles the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of krogers executive officers including the named executive officers who are identified in the summary compensation table below with the exception of the chief executive officer the committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those independent board members establish the ceos compensation the committees philosophy on compensation generally applies to all levels of kroger management it requires kroger to make total compensation competitive include opportunities for equity ownership as part of compensation and use incentive compensation to help drive performance by providing superior pay for superior results the following discussion and analysis addresses the compensation of the named executive officers and the factors considered by the committee in setting compensation for the named executive officers and making recommendations to the independent board members in the case of the ceos compensation additional detail is provided in the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosures that follow this discussion and analysis executive compensation objectives the committee has several related objectives regarding compensation first the committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that executive officers play at kroger second some elements of compensation should help align the interests of the officers with your interests as shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers a to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and b to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives in developing compensation programs and amounts to meet these objectives the committee exercises judgment to ensure that executive officer compensation does not exceed reasonable and competitive levels in light of krogers performance and the needs of the business to meet these objectives the committee has taken a number of steps over the last several years including the following consulted regularly with its independent advisor from mercer human resource consulting on the design of compensation plans and on the amount of compensation that is necessary and appropriate for krogers senior leaders in light of the committees objectives in the committee retained another independent consultant to determine whether the compensation plans and amounts comport with the committees objectives and produce value for krogers shareholders conducted an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the named executive officers on tally sheets the review includes an assessment for each named executive officer including the ceo of salary performance based cash compensation or bonus both annual and long term equity accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits severance benefits available under the kroger co employee protection plan and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considered internal pay equity at kroger the committee is aware of reported concerns at other companies regarding disproportionate compensation awards to chief executive officers the committee has assured itself that the compensation of krogers ceo and that of the other named executive officers bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities recommended share ownership guidelines adopted by the board of directors these guidelines require directors officers and some other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger stock the guidelines require the ceo to acquire and maintain ownership of kroger shares equal to times his base salary the vice chairman which position was eliminated during the latter part of and the chief operating officer at times their base salaries executive vice presidents senior vice presidents and non employee directors at times their base salaries or annual base cash retainers and other officers and key executives at times their base salaries establishing executive compensation the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos salary the bonus potential for the ceo the nature and amount of any equity awards made to the ceo and any other compensation questions related to the ceo in setting the annual bonus potential for the ceo the independent directors determine the dollar amount that will be multiplied by the percentage payout under the annual bonus plan applicable to all corporate management including the named executive officers the independent directors retain discretion to reduce the percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive the independent directors thus make a separate determination annually concerning both the ceos bonus potential and the percentage of bonus paid the committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other named executive officers the committees annual review of compensation for the named executive officers includes the following a detailed report by officer that describes current compensation the value of equity compensation previously awarded the value of retirement benefits earned and any severance or other benefits payable upon a change of control an internal equity comparison of compensation at various senior levels this current and historical analysis is undertaken to ensure that the relationship of ceo compensation to other senior officer compensation and senior officer compensation to other levels in the organization is equitable reports from the committees compensation consultants described below comparing named executive officer and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies primarily our competitors to ensure that the committees objectives of competitiveness are met a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary bonus potential and equity awards for each of the senior officers including the other named executive officers the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team historical information regarding salary bonus and equity compensation for a year period in considering each of the factors above the committee does not make use of a formula but rather subjectively reviews each in making its compensation determination thecommitteescompensationc onsultantsand benchmarking as referenced earlier in this proxy statement the committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target annual performance based bonus target cash compensation the sum of salary and bonus annualized long term incentive awards such as stock options other equity awards and performance based long term bonuses and total direct compensation the sum of all these elements the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded food and drug retailers for the group consisted of costco wholesale supervalu cvs target great atlantic pacific tea walgreens rite aid wal mart safeway this peer group is the same group as was used in the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant industry consolidation and other competitive forces will change the peer group used over time the consultant also provides the committee data from companies in general industry a representation of major publicly traded companies these data are reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector in the committee directly engaged an additional compensation consultant to conduct a review of krogers executive compensation this consultant from frederic w cook co inc examined the compensation philosophy peer group composition annual cash bonus and long term incentive compensation including equity awards the consultant concluded that krogers executive compensation program met the committees objectives and that it provides a strong linkage between pay and performance kroger is the second largest company as measured by annual revenues when compared with the peer group referenced above and is the largest traditional food and drug retailer the committee has therefore sought to ensure that salaries paid to our executive officers are at or above the median paid by competitors for comparable positions and to provide annual bonus potentials to our executive officers that if annual business plan objectives are achieved would cause their total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median componentsof executive compensationatkroger compensation for our named executive officers is comprised of the following salary performance based annual cash bonus annual non equity incentive pay performance based long term cash bonus long term non equity incentive pay equity retirement and other benefits and perquisites salary we provide our named executive officers and other employees a fixed amount of cash compensation salary for their work salaries for named executive officers with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the committee the ceos salary is established by the independent directors salaries for the named executive officers were reviewed in june the amount of each executives salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the committee or in the case of the ceo of the committee and the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure and relationship with the salaries of other executives at kroger the assessment of individual contribution is based on a subjective determination without the use of performance targets in the following areas leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the named executive officers received salary increases to the amounts shown below following the annual review of their compensation in june salaries david b dillon j michael schlotman w rodney mcmullen don w mcgeorge donald e becker paul w heldman performance based annual cash bonus a large percentage of our employees at all levels including the named executive officers are eligible to receive a performance based annual cash bonus based on kroger or unit performance the committee establishes bonus potentials for each executive officer other than the ceo whose bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts which can exceed of the potential amounts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the thresholds established by the committee the committee considers several factors in making its determination or recommendation as to bonus potentials first the individuals level within the organization is a factor in that the committee believes that more senior executives should have a substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance second the individuals salary is a factor so that a substantial portion of a named executive officers total cash compensation is dependent upon krogers performance finally the committee considers the reports of its compensation consultants to assess the bonus potentials of the named executive officers in light of total compensation paid to comparable executive positions in the industry the annual cash bonus potential in effect at the end of the year for each named executive officer is shown below actual bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual bonus potential david b dillon j michael schlotman w rodney mcmullen don w mcgeorge donald e becker paul w heldman the amount of bonus that the named executive officers earn each year is determined by krogers performance compared to targets established by the committee based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors in thirty percent of bonus was earned based on an identical sales target for krogers supermarkets and other business operations thirty percent was based on a target for ebitda excluding supermarket fuel thirty percent was based on implementation and results of a set of measures under our strategic plan and ten percent was based on the performance of new capital projects compared to their budgets an additional would be earned if kroger achieved three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations achievement of at least of the targeted fuel ebitda as set forth in the business plan increase of at least in gallons sold at identical fuel centers and achievement of the planned number of fuel centers placed in service likewise a reduction in bonus would result if any of the three fuel goals was not achieved over time the committee has placed an increased emphasis on the strategic plan by making the target more difficult to achieve the bonus plan allows for minimal bonus to be earned at relatively low levels to provide incentive for achieving even higher levels of performance following the close of the year the committee reviewed krogers performance against the identical sales ebitda strategic plan and capital projects objectives and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives krogers ebitda excluding impairment charges for was billion and krogers identical sales for were in krogers supermarket fuel ebitda was million or of the goal established at the beginning of the year krogers sale of fuel in identical supermarket fuel centers was million gallons or over the prior year we placed supermarket fuel centers in operation during exceeding our goal of centers as a result the officers earned the additional fuel bonus as a result of the companys performance when compared to the targets established by the committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors the named executive officers earned of their bonus potentials which percentage payout is substantially lower than the bonus payouts over the last several years principally reflecting the degree to which kroger failed to achieve its ebitda and sales goals the targets established by the committee for annual bonus amounts based on identical sales and ebitda results the actual results and the bonus percentage earned in each of the components of named executive officer bonus were as follows targets component minimum result amount earned identical sales ebitda billion billion billion strategic plan capital projects fuel bonus as described in the text above identical sales of pay at if ebitda goal is achieved if ebitda goal is not achieved identical sales of pay at the strategic plan and capital projects components also were established by the committee but are not disclosed as they are competitively sensitive in as in all years the committee retained discretion to reduce the bonus payout for named executive officers if the committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus those bodies also retained discretion to adjust the targets under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year no adjustments were made to the payout or the targets during the percentage paid for represented and resulted from performance that due to a weak economy and persistent deflation did not meet our original business plan objectives a comparison of bonus percentages for the named executive officers in prior years demonstrates the variability of incentive compensation annual cash bonus fiscal year percentage the actual amounts of annual performance based cash bonuses paid to the named executive officers for are shown in the summary compensation table under the heading non equity incentive plan compensation these amounts represent the bonus potentials for each named executive officer multiplied by the percentage earned in in no event can any participant receive a performance based annual cash bonus in excess of beginning with the annual cash bonus the maximum amount that a participant including each named executive officer can earn is further limited to of the participants potential amount after considering recommendations made by its compensation consultants the committee determined to reduce the number of metrics considered for purposes of calculating annual bonuses beginning with the annual bonus for thirty percent of bonus will be based on an identical sales target for krogers supermarkets and other business operations thirty percent will be based on a target for ebitda excluding supermarket fuel and forty percent will be based on implementation and results of a set of measures under our strategic plan an additional will be earned if kroger achieves three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations subject to adjustment by the committee based on the effects of certain fuel programs achievement of at least of the targeted fuel ebitda as set forth in the business plan increase of at least in gallons sold at identical fuel centers and achievement of the planned number of fuel centers placed in service performance based long term cash bonus after reviewing executive compensation with its consultant in the committee determined that the long term component which was made up of equity awards of krogers executive compensation was not competitive the committee developed a plan to provide an incentive to the named executive officers to achieve the long term goals established by the board of directors by conditioning a portion of compensation on the achievement of those goals beginning in approximately kroger executives including the named executive officers are eligible to participate in a performance based cash bonus plan designed to reward participants for improving the long term performance of kroger bonuses are earned based on the extent to which kroger advances its strategic plan by improving its performance in four key categories based on results of customer surveys and reducing total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel the plan consisted of two components the phase in component measured improvements through fiscal year the other component measured the improvements through fiscal year actual payouts were based on the degree to which improvements were achieved and were awarded in increments based on the participants salary at the end of fiscal year participants received a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increased and a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs the committee administers the plan and determined the bonus payout amounts based on achievement of the performance criteria total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were and at the end of the phase in period were combining this operating cost improvement with our performance in our key categories resulted in payouts for the phase in component of of the participants annual salary in effect at the end of fiscal year total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the end of fiscal year were combining this operating cost improvement with our performance in our key categories resulted in payouts for the full four year performance period of of the participants annual salary in effect at the end of fiscal year after reviewing an analysis conducted by its independent compensation consultant in the committee determined that continuation of the long term cash bonus was necessary in order for long term compensation for the named executive officers to be competitive and to continue to focus the officers on achieving krogers long term business objectives as a result the committee adopted a long term bonus plan under which bonuses are earned based on the extent to which kroger advances its strategic plan by improving its performance in four key categories based on results of customer surveys reducing total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and improving its performance in eleven key attributes designed to measure associate satisfaction and one key attribute designed to measure how krogers focus on its values supports how associates do business based on the results of associate surveys the plan measures improvements through fiscal year participants receive a payout for each point by which the performance in the key categories increases a payout for each percentage reduction in operating costs and a payout based on improvement in associate engagement measures total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel at the commencement of the plan were actual payouts are based on the degree to which improvements are achieved and will be awarded based on the participants salary at the end of fiscal year in no event can any participant receive a performance based long term cash bonus in excess of although the committee is considering adoption of a new long term bonus plan that plan has not yet been adopted equity awards based on krogers common stock are granted periodically to the named executive officers and a large number of other employees equity participation aligns the interests of employees with your interests as shareholders and kroger historically has distributed equity awards widely in kroger granted stock options to approximately employees including the named executive officers under one of krogers long term incentive plans the options permit the holder to purchase kroger common stock at an option price equal to the closing price of kroger common stock on the date of the grant the committee adopted a policy of granting options only at one of the four committee meetings conducted shortly following krogers public release of its quarterly earnings results krogers long term incentive plans also provide for other equity based awards including restricted stock during kroger awarded shares of restricted stock to approximately employees including the named executive officers this amount is comparable to amounts awarded over the past few years as we began reducing the number of stock options granted and increasing the number of shares of restricted stock awards the change in krogers broad based equity program from predominantly stock options to a mixture of options and restricted shares was precipitated by a the perception of increased value that restricted shares offer b the retention benefit to kroger of restricted shares and c accounting conventions that now require stock options to be expensed making the change cost neutral to kroger the committee considers several factors in determining the amount of options and restricted shares awarded to the named executive officers or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding equity based and other long term compensation awarded by our competitors the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of equity based awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all named executive officers other than in the case of the ceo the committee has long recognized that the amount of compensation provided to the named executive officers through equity based pay is often below the amount paid by our competitors lower equity based awards for the named executive officers and other senior management permit a broader base of kroger associates to participate in equity awards amounts of equity awards issued and outstanding for the named executive officers are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis retirement and other benefits kroger maintains a defined benefit and several defined contribution retirement plans for its employees the named executive officers participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding retirement benefits available to the named executive officers can be found in the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative description that follows this discussion and analysis kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the named executive officers participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year compensation deferred bears interest until paid out at the rate representing krogers cost of ten year debt in the year of deferral as determined by krogers ceo prior to the beginning of each deferral year in that rate was deferred amounts are paid out only in cash in accordance with a deferral option selected by the participant at the time the deferral election is made we adopted the kroger co employee protection plan or kepp during fiscal year that plan was amended and restated in all of our management employees and administrative support personnel whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service are covered kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described in the plan when an employee is actually or constructively terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of kroger as defined in the plan participants are entitled to severance pay of up to months salary and bonus the actual amount is dependent upon pay level and years of service kepp can be amended or terminated by the board at any time prior to a change in control stock option and restricted stock agreements with participants in krogers long term incentive plans provide that those awards vest with options becoming immediately exercisable and restrictions on restricted stock lapsing upon a change in control as described in the agreements none of the named executive officers except mr mcgeorge is party to an employment agreement under that agreement mr mcgeorge former president and chief operating officer and former member of krogers board of directors will continue as an active kroger employee and will continue to receive his salary and other active employee benefits through october during that period mr mcgeorge will not engage in any business activity in competition with krogers retail business thereafter his active employment will cease and he will be eligible to receive retirement benefits perquisites the committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide the named executive officers a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the only perquisites provided were payments of premiums of life insurance accidental death and dismemberment insurance and long term disability insurance policies and reimbursement of the tax effects of the life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance payments and reimbursement for the tax effects of participation in a nonqualified retirement plan the life insurance benefit along with reimbursement of the tax effect of that benefit was offered beginning several years ago to replace a split dollar life insurance benefit that was substantially more costly to kroger currently active executives including the named executive officers and retired executives receive this benefit beginning in kroger no longer will reimburse the tax effects of insurance premiums or participation in a nonqualified retirement plan as these gross ups have been eliminated in addition the named executive officers are entitled to the following benefit that does not constitute a perk as defined by the sec rules personal use of kroger aircraft which officers may lease from kroger and pay the average variable cost of operating the aircraft making officers more available and allowing for a more efficient use of their time the total amount of perquisites furnished to the named executive officers is shown in the summary compensation table and described in more detail in footnote to that table executive compensation recoupment policy if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual bonus or a long term bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the committee then the officer upon demand from the committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment section m of the internal revenue code tax laws place a limit of on the amount of some types of compensation for the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers that is tax deductible by kroger compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria and have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers will be deductible by kroger in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of named executive officers krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is material and supports krogers compensation philosophy the committee also will attempt to maximize the amount of compensation expense that is deductible by kroger compensation committee report the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management of the company the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this proxy statement based on its review and discussions with management the compensation

consolidated financial statements be included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended january as filed with the sec this report is submitted by the audit committee ronald l sargent chair susan j kropf susan m phillips bobby s shackouls amendment to the companys articles of incorporation item no the board of directors recommends that shareholders approve an amendment to krogers articles of incorporation requiring a majority vote for the election of directors ohio law provides that unless otherwise specified in a companys articles of incorporation a director is elected by a plurality of the votes cast krogers articles of incorporation do not specify the voting standard required in director elections so kroger directors currently are elected by a plurality vote that is a director nominee who receives the highest number of affirmative votes cast is elected whether or not those votes constitute a majority including withheld votes in krogers board of directors adopted as kroger policy a form of majority voting for uncontested director elections implementing this policy through its guidelines on issues of corporate governance under this policy directors continue to be elected by a plurality vote but the policy requires that a director nominee who receives a greater number of withheld votes than for votes must immediately tender his or her resignation from the board the board then would decide through a process managed by the corporate governance committee and excluding the nominee in question whether to accept the resignation the boards explanation of its decision would be promptly disclosed in a publicly issued press release at the annual meeting of shareholders held in krogers shareholders adopted a proposal that requested the board of directors take steps to amend the articles of incorporation to provide for majority voting for directors in uncontested elections after consideration of the shareholder proposal the board has authorized and recommends that shareholders approve an amendment to krogers articles of incorporation that would specify that director nominees in an uncontested election would be elected by a majority vote under this provision each vote is specifically counted for or against the directors election an affirmative majority of the total number of votes cast for or against a director nominee will be required for election shareholders also will be entitled to abstain with respect to the election of a director abstentions will have no effect in determining whether the required affirmative majority vote has been obtained under ohio law shareholders must approve an amendment to krogers articles of incorporation to change the voting standard in director elections if the proposed amendment is approved a new paragraph will be added as article sixth of krogers articles of incorporation with succeeding articles renumbered accordingly that reads as follows the vote required for election of a director by the shareholders will except in a contested election or when cumulative voting is in effect be the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in favor of or against the election of a nominee at a meeting of shareholders in a contested election or when cumulative voting is in effect directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the election an election will be considered contested if as of the record date there are more nominees for election than positions on the board of directors to be filled by election at the meeting in addition we propose to make minor statutory conforming changes all changes are shown on appendix with additions shown underlined and deletions shown as strikeouts if approved this amendment will become effective upon the filing with the ohio secretary of state of amended articles of incorporation kroger would make such a filing promptly after the annual meeting upon approval of this proposal and the filing of the amended articles of incorporation an incumbent director who does not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for his or her re election must tender his or her resignation under ohio law an incumbent director who is not re elected may remain in office until his or her successor is elected and qualified continuing as a holdover director until his or her position is filled the board will adopt a holdover director resignation policy to address the continuation in office of a director that would result from application of the holdover director provision under the holdover director resignation policy the board will decide whether to accept the resignation in a process similar to the one the board currently uses pursuant to the existing policy the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal selection of auditors item no the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for the appointment compensation and retention of krogers independent auditor as required by law and by applicable nyse rules on march the audit committee appointed pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor for the fiscal year ending january while shareholder ratification of the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp as krogers independent auditor is not required by krogers regulations or otherwise the board of directors is submitting the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp to shareholders for ratification as it has in past years as a good corporate governance practice if the shareholders fail to ratify the selection the audit committee may but is not required to reconsider whether to retain that firm even if the selection is ratified the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of kroger and its shareholders a representative of pricewaterhousecoopers llp is expected to be present at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal disclosure of auditor fees the following describes the fees billed to kroger by pricewaterhousecoopers llp related to the fiscal years ended january and january fiscal year fiscal year audit fees audit related fees tax fees all other fees total audit fees for the years ended january and january respectively were for professional services rendered for the audits of krogers consolidated financial statements the issuance of comfort letters to underwriters consents income tax provision procedures and assistance with the review of documents filed with the sec audit related fees for the years ended january and january respectively were for assurance and related services pertaining to accounting consultation in connection with acquisitions attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards tax fees we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for other tax services for the years ended january and january all other fees we did not engage pricewaterhousecoopers llp for other services for the years ended january and january the audit committee requires that it approve in advance all audit and non audit work performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp on march the audit committee approved services to be performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp for the remainder of fiscal year that are related to the audit of kroger or involve the audit itself in the audit committee adopted an audit and non audit service pre approval policy pursuant to the terms of that policy the committee will annually pre approve certain defined services that are expected to be provided by the independent auditors if it becomes appropriate during the year to engage the independent accountant for additional services the audit committee must first approve the specific services before the independent accountant may perform the additional work pricewaterhousecoopers llp has advised the audit committee that neither the firm nor any member of the firm has any financial interest direct or indirect in any capacity in kroger or its subsidiaries shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by a shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at krogers executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting shareholder resolution whereas in the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ipcc fourth assessment report states it is very likely that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have heavily contributed to global warming furthermore impacts of climate change will vary regionally but aggregated and discounted to the present they are very likely to impose net annual costs which will increase over time as global temperatures increase whereas in the united states department of agriculture usda reported that no matter the region weather and climate factors such as temperature precipitation co concentrations and water availability directly impact the health and well being of plants pasture rangeland and livestock specifically climate change affects average temperatures and temperature extremes timing and geographical patterns of precipitation snowmelt runoff evaporation and soil moisture the frequency of disturbances such as drought insect and disease outbreaks severe storms and forest fires atmospheric composition and air quality and patterns of human settlement and land use change which directly impact crop yields and meat production whereas in acclimatise a risk management firm reported that climate related impacts will be felt throughout a companys business model with consequences for its raw materials supply chains essential utilities assets and operations markets customers and products its workforce and the communities in which it is located whereas increasingly investors believe that there is an intersection between climate change and corporate financial performance goldman sachs reported in may we find that while many companies acknowledge the challenges climate change presents there are significant differences in the extent to which companies are taking action differences in the effectiveness of response across industries create opportunities to lose or establish competitive advantage which we believe will prove increasingly important to investment performance whereas a report by ceres and riskmetrics ranked krogers corporate climate change governance in the bottom half of an industry peer group and the bottom third of all companies analyzed representing of the worlds largest retail pharmaceutical technology apparel and other consumer facing companies whereas the carbon disclosure project cdp representing institutional investors with assets of more than trillion under management requested corporations to disclose their climate related risks in february kroger currently does not publicly respond to the cdp questionnaire whereas leading companies in the food retailing industry such tesco wal mart and sainsburys publicly report on risks including implications to their product and manufacturing supply chain from climate change whereas information from corporations on their climate change risks and strategies is essential to investors as they assess the strengths of corporate securities in the context of climate change resolved shareholders request that within months of the annual meeting the board of directors provide a report to shareholders prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information describing how kroger will assess and manage the impacts of climate change on the corporation with specific regard to its supply chain and plans to disclose such information through public reporting mechanisms the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the important role it plays as a good steward of the environment we have numerous green initiatives in place to save energy and preserve our natural resources for each of the past several years kroger has published on line the kroger co public responsibilities report and doing our part the kroger co s green report that highlight the companys green initiatives in greater detail this proposal is similar to one submitted by a shareholder in each of the annual meetings held in and those proposals were defeated by shareholders this proposal requests assessment of climate change and furnishing a report to shareholders we believe such a report in many ways would be duplicative of the current efforts underway and would provide little benefit to shareholders beyond what kroger already has furnished we

stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses the combo stores are the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a mile radius the company believes this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce multi department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multi department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry a marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi department stores they offer full service grocery and pharmacy departments as well as an expanded general merchandise area that includes outdoor living products electronics home goods and toys price impact warehouse stores offer a no frills low cost warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items quality meat dairy baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of

important role in the companys merchandising strategy our supermarkets on average stock approximately private label items the companys corporate brand products are produced and sold in three tiers private selection is the premium quality brand designed to be a unique item in a category or to meet or beat the gourmet or upscale brands the banner brand kroger ralphs king soopers etc which represents the majority of the companys private label items is designed to satisfy customers with quality products before kroger will carry a banner brand product the product quality must meet our

buy analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market based transfer prices versus open market purchases as of january the company operated manufacturing plants these plants consisted of dairies deli or bakery plants five grocery product plants three beverage plants two meat plants and two cheese plants a managements discussion and analysis offinancial condition and results of operations our business the kroger co was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nations largest retailers as measured by revenue operating supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger ralphs fred meyer food less king soopers smiths frys frys marketplace dillons qfc and city market of these stores have fuel centers we also operate convenience stores and fine jewelry stores kroger operates manufacturing plants primarily bakeries and dairies which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers such costs include procurement and distribution costs facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers our performance by focusing on the customer through our customer st strategy we were able to report solid results in excluding the non cash asset impairment charges totaling billion pre tax billion after tax related to our division in southern california during what continues to be a difficult operating environment in our identical supermarket sales increased excluding fuel our earnings were per diluted share or per diluted share excluding the non cash asset impairment charges referred to above we did not achieve our original goals for identical supermarket sales growth of to and earnings per share of to per diluted share as cautious consumers significant deflation and intense competition affected margins and sales growth nonetheless we strengthened our overall competitive position by increasing the number of households that are loyal to kroger and we are earning a greater share of their business as a result we continue to generate tonnage growth in both perishable and non perishable categories that is among the strongest in the industry sustainable identical sales and earnings growth remains one of our key long term objectives we continue to widen the gap between our identical supermarkets sales growth trends and those of several of our competitors we believe this has extremely positive implications for our associates customers and shareholders now and as we grow our business in the future market share is an important part of our long term strategy market share is important to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share based on nielsen homescan data our estimated market share increased in total by approximately basis points in across the divisions in which we operate nielsen homescan data includes scanned products across many retail channels not including restaurants this information also indicates that our market share increased in of the divisions declined in three and remained unchanged in one these market share results are consistent with our long term strategy a results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods net earnings net earnings totaled million for compared to net earnings totaling billion in each of and the net earnings for include non cash asset impairment charges totaling billion after tax related to a division in southern california the non cash impairment charges the impairment primarily resulted from the write off of the ralphs division goodwill balance excluding these impairment charges adjusted net earnings for the year would have been billion additionally the decrease in net earnings for compared to resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by a lifo charge of million pre tax compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in net earnings also included after tax costs of million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike the slight increase in our net earnings for compared to resulted from strong non fuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share in are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are non recurring non cash charges that are not directly related to our day to day business we also excluded these charges from our incentive plan calculations for the year earnings per diluted share totaled and adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled compared to in or excluding the per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike and in the decline in adjusted net earnings per share in compared to resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit partially offset by lower lifo charges and after tax costs of million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike in our earnings per share growth in compared to resulted from increased net earnings strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of kroger stock sales total sales in millions percentage percentage increase increase total supermarket sales without fuel total supermarket fuel sales total supermarket sales other sales total sales other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores including fuel jewelry stores sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers and variable interest entities a the slight increase in total sales and the decrease in other sales and total supermarket fuel sales for compared to was attributable to the year over year decline in retail fuel prices the change in our total supermarket sales without fuel for over was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales and retail square footage identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multi department stores we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below based on the week

discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable fred meyer multi department stores we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales our annualized

represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january and january comparable supermarket sales in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers comparable th quarter store count a fifo gross margin we calculate first in first out fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the last in first out lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness our fifo gross margin rates as a percentage of sales were in in and in our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our fifo gross margin rates decreased basis points in and basis points in the decrease in our non fuel fifo gross margin rate since reflects our continued investments in our customer st strategy in addition fifo gross margin in compared to decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation partially offset by improvements in shrink advertising and warehousing and transportation expenses as a percentage of sales lifo charge the lifo charge was million in million in and million in the lifo charge in compared to decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the lifo method of valuation for compared to the last three quarters of experienced product cost deflation excluding fuel in our lifo charge primarily resulted from product cost inflation related to tobacco products and pharmacy an increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in compared to we revised our lifo charge by million pre tax million after tax this revision was made to account for certain promotional allowances in our lifo indices in we believe this adjustment is not material to any individual year or any quarterly period within such years presented see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for more information operating general and administrative expenses operating general and administrative oga expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga oga expenses as a percentage of sales were in in and in the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our oga rate due to the very low oga rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased basis points in compared to oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in decreased basis points in compared to the decrease compared to resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth a reduction in bag expense lower incentive compensation and reduced utility costs these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees health care costs and wages wage expenses have increased due to increased hours worked and lower employee turnover in the current economic environment which has resulted in increased average hourly wages the decrease in our oga rate in excluding the effect of retail fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in compared to was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers partially offset by increases in credit card fees and health care costs a rent expense rent expense was million in as compared to million in and million in rent expense as a percentage of sales was in as compared to in and in the decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was billion in and billion in and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to and was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities totaling billion in billion in and billion in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales was in in and in the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in compared to as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increased depreciation expense and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity deflation and year over year decline in retail fuel prices the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increasing sales interest expense net interest expense totaled million in million in and million in the increase in interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year partially offset by interest income related to the mark to market of ineffective fair value swaps income taxes our effective income tax rate was in in and in the effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge being mostly non deductible for tax purposes excluding the non cash impairment charges our effective rate in was the and effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes in addition the effective tax rates for and differ from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues with the taxing authorities common stock repurchase program we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule b and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock from time to time we made open market purchases of kroger stock totaling million in million in and billion in under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs in december we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately million in million in and million in of kroger stock under the stock option program a in and to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in and compared to capital expenditures capital expenditures including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled billion in compared to billion in and the increase in capital spending in compared to and was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects during capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled million compared to million for this increase was due to kroger purchasing several previously leased retail stores one office building and one distribution center at very attractive rates during the table

operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain a self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both workers compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability claims are not discounted we are also similarly self insured for property related losses we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of million on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stop loss coverage is in excess of million per claim up to million per claim in california and million outside of california the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in million in and million in included in the amount are asset impairments recorded totaling million for a southern california reporting unit we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results a goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of january we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities with goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value in the third quarter of our operating performance suffered due to persistent deflation and intense competition based on our revised forecast during the third quarter of and the initial results of our annual budget process for the supermarket reporting units management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing at these reporting units we did not test for impairment our variable interest entities with recorded goodwill balances as no triggering event occurred the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by economic conditions and responses to competitive actions in southern california as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows along with comparable fair value information management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value resulting in an impairment charge subsequent to the impairment no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a sales weighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value the discounted cash flows assume long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of in addition the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january assessment we performed our annual assessment in the fourth quarter for all supermarket and variable interest entity vie reporting units with goodwill balances based on current and future expected cash flows we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our remaining goodwill balance except for one supermarket reporting unit and one vie reporting unit with recorded goodwill of million and million respectively for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and see note to the consolidated financial statements the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition a store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings if any in merchandise costs we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred post retirement benefit plans a company sponsored defined benefit pension plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized we adopted the measurement date provisions of gaap effective february the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december measurement date all plans are measured as of our fiscal year end the non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of gaap decreased shareowners equity by approximately million million after tax and increased long term liabilities by approximately million there was no effect on our results of operations the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability a the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market aa yield curve we utilized a discount rate of for year end for both pension and other benefits a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january by approximately million to determine the expected return on pension plan assets we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories for and we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of our pension plans average return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december net of investment management fees and expenses increased primarily due to the strength of the market in we believe our pension return assumption is appropriate for the past years our average annual return has been the average annual return for the sp over the same period of time has been in addition forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations indicate an return assumption is reasonable see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of krogers pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions projected benefit percentage obligation expense point change decrease increase decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets we contributed million in million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans although we are not required to make cash contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we contributed and expensed million in million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts the k retirement savings account plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service a b multi employer plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded in accordance with gaap we made contributions to these plans and recognized expense of million in million in and million in based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets i e the amount of underfunding as of december because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of krogers contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing krogers share of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer as of december we estimate that krogers share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion pre tax or billion after tax this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of million pre tax or million after tax as of december compared to december the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since in we expect to contribute approximately million to our multi employer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions based on current market conditions we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years but we believe it is unlikely that contributions will double during that period which is a change from our estimate at year end finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and krogers future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand krogers share of the underfunding could increase and krogers future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation a deferred rent we recognize rent holidays including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets uncertain tax positions effective february we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes these standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return these standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years through the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january as well as all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately in and in of inventories were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january and by million at january we follow the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting a we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately billion in billion in and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs all years presented now include amounts for certain vendor allowances related to directed store deliveries we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in and compared to billion in the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment charge and changes in our operating assets and liabilities we realized an increase in cash of million in and decreases in cash of million in and million in from changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in compared to is primarily due to an increase in the changes of income taxes receivable and payable accounts payable and inventories offset partially by decreases in the changes of deposits in transit and prepaid expenses the decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in the change in income taxes receivable and payable these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling million in million in and million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in compared to and because we applied our overpayment of income taxes to current year taxes the overpayment resulted primarily from accounting method changes related to asset capitalization net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was billion in compared to billion in and the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in compared to due primarily to higher capital spending partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in compared to capital expenditures including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions were billion in billion in and billion in refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years a net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in compared to million in and million in the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on long term debt and our credit facility offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and capital stock the increase in the amount of cash used in compared to was primarily a result of payments on long term debt and the bank revolver offset by decreased stock repurchases we repurchased million of kroger stock in compared to million in and billion in we paid dividends totaling million in million in and million in debt management total debt including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations decreased million to billion as of year end compared to year end the decrease in compared to resulted from the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of offset by payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines total debt decreased million to billion as of year end compared to year end the decrease in compared to resulted from the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of offset by decreased commercial paper the payments on the bank revolver the repayment of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of that came due in our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million in each of the three years ended and the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million in and million in factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our a p f rated commercial paper cp program at january we did not have any cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa bbb the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating and lower the amount we are able to borrow on a daily basis under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio a our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of january our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our applicable percentage ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio exceeded to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio fell below to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facility includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our non cash asset impairment charge related to goodwill in our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans which totaled million in a we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on february see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding this adoption the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined we did not have any borrowings under our credit facility as of january amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january and stated fixed and swapped interest rates if applicable for all other debt instruments the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of january we maintained a billion five year revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of january we had no borrowings under our credit agreement money market lines or outstanding commercial paper the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january we had authorized for issuance million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of our subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements in addition we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a ownership interest our share of the responsibility for a this indebtedness should the entities be unable to meet their obligations totals approximately million based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations we have also agreed to guarantee up to million the indebtedness of an entity in which we have a ownership interest our share of the responsibility as of january should the entity be unable to meet its obligations totals approximately million and is collateralized by approximately million of inventory located in our stores we consolidate this entity because we are the primary beneficiary and therefore the entire million is a liability on the consolidated balance sheets we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while krogers aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability recently adopted accounting standards in december the fasb amended its existing standards to provide additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans the new standards require disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made the fair value of each major category of plan assets valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets the effect of measurements on changes in plan assets when using significant unobservable inputs and significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets the new standards become effective for fiscal years ending after december we adopted the amended standards effective january see note to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures effective may we adopted new standards for subsequent events the purpose of the new standards is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued see note to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures effective may we adopted new standards that effect the accounting and disclosures related to certain financial instruments including a providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased b identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly c amending the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements and d requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements a effective february we adopted the new standards that require enhanced disclosures on an entitys derivative and hedging activities the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements effective february we adopted the new standards that clarify that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of its adoption effective february we adopted new standards related to business combinations the new standards expand the definitions of a business and the fair value measurement and reporting in a business combination all business combinations completed after february will be accounted for under the new standards effective february we adopted new standards that deferred the fair value disclosures for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new standards in december the fasb amended its existing standards for a parents noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to the subsidiary the new standard defines a noncontrolling interest previously called a minority interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent the new standard requires among other things that a noncontrolling interest be clearly identified labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as equity but separate from the parents equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and that if a subsidiary is deconsolidated the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent retains in the former subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the non controlling equity investment we adopted the new standard effective february and applied it retrospectively as a result we reclassified noncontrolling interests in amounts of from the mezzanine section to equity in the january consolidated balance sheet certain reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard recorded amounts for prior periods previously presented as net earnings which are now presented as net earnings attributable to the kroger co have not changed as a result of the adoption of the new standard effective january we adopted the amended standards related to disclosures about interests in vies these amended standards require additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with vies and transfers of financial assets the adoption of these new amended standards did not change any disclosures in our consolidated financial statements due to our vies being immaterial recently issued accounting standards in june the fasb amended its existing standards to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the new standards will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january while we are still finalizing the evaluation of the impact of these amended standards on our consolidated financial statements we believe these new standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements a in january the fasb issued guidance that amends and clarifies existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures this guidance requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level and reasons for such transfers and the separate presentation of purchases sales issuances and settlement in the level reconciliation it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and level fair value measurements this guidance is effective for our first quarter of except for the new disclosures in the level reconciliation the level disclosures are effective for our first quarter of we do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about krogers future performance these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in for we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions we expect non fuel operating margins to have a slight reduction to a slight improvement in rate in from excluding the non cash impairment charges recorded for we expect fuel margins which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold for we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on cost changes for products in our inventory we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to maintain our current debt coverage ratios and to pay cash dividends as market conditions change we plan to re evaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations a capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investments for to be in the range of billion excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings we expect to reduce our internal capital plans by approximately billion in total over the next three fiscal years our original internal capital plans projected year over year continued capital expenditure growth we now expect capital expenditures to average under billion a year over the next three years based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit agreement we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately we expect rent expense as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration productivity improvements shrink warehousing and transportation these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers although we are not required to make cash contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately million in addition we expect our cash contributions and expense to the k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in compared to we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans in subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions in addition we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years but we believe it unlikely that contributions will double during that period which is a change from our estimate at year end a we expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our customers through our company branded credit card in to be approximately million we believe no additional goodwill impairments will be reasonably possible in we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in covering store employees in albuquerque cincinnati dallas detroit ft wayne houston little rock portland seattle and toledo we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters for employees in california and portland upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us if market conditions change it could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including persistent deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized a in addition to the factors identified above our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing our operating margins without fuel could decline more than expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations we could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing kroger and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected outcomes in these matters however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable cannot be foreseen rent expense which includes subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy increased store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets or the remaining terms of leases use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate plan compensation and length of service of participants our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated should asset values in these funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated if weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated changes in laws or regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers which could affect sales and earnings changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions including the rate of inflation population growth and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth a changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin gasoline sales provide a positive effect on oga expense as a percentage of sales our capital expenditures expected square footage growth and number of store projects completed over the next three fiscal years could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment changes in the companys credit ratings fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt impairment losses including goodwill could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows market values or business valuations in the market our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment real estate market values competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our estimated expense and obligation for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts these assumptions include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products or may decrease the customer demand for certain products increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products additionally increases in the cost of inputs such as utility costs or raw material costs could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our

is followed for substantially all store inventories at the companys supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory when compared to the retail method of accounting the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets buildings and land improvements are depreciated based on lives varying from to years all new purchases of store equipment are assigned lives varying from three to nine years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term to which they relate which varies from four to years or the useful life of the asset manufacturing plant and distribution center equipment is depreciated over lives varying from three to years information technology assets are generally depreciated over five years depreciation and amortization expense was in in and in interest costs on significant projects constructed for the companys own use are capitalized as part of the costs of the newly constructed

liabilities on the companys consolidated balance sheets goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of trigger events the reviews are performed at the operating division level generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the divisions goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the divisions goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a trigger event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if the company identifies impairment for long lived assets to be held and used the company compares the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows the company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for sale the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal the

expense store closing costs the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income the company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual a notes to consolidated financial statements continued exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose is adjusted to income in the proper period owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the companys policy on impairment of long lived assets inventory write downs if any in connection with store closings are classified in merchandise costs costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred the following table summarizes accrual activity

resources including raw materials utilized in its manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in its stores manufacturing facilities and administrative offices the company enters into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of the normal course of business the companys current program relative to commodity price protection and the methods by which the company accounts for its purchase commitments are described in note benefit plans effective february the company adopted the new standards for recognition and disclosure provisions except for the measurement date change for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans which requires the recognition of the funded status of its retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive a notes to consolidated financial statements continued income aoci the company adopted the measurement date provisions of these new standards effective february the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december measurement date all plans are now measured as of the companys fiscal year end in the non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions decreased shareowners equity by approximately after tax and increased long term liabilities by approximately there was no effect on the companys results of operations the determination of the obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company also participates in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded the company administers and makes contributions to the employee k retirement savings accounts contributions to the employee k retirement savings accounts are expensed when

this method the company recognizes compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january as well as all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january the company recognizes share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition the company records expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the awards lapse deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting basis refer to note for the types of differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred income tax assets and liabilities deferred income taxes are classified as a net current or noncurrent asset or liability based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes a deferred tax asset or liability that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is classified according to the expected reversal date uncertain tax positions effective february the company adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes these standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return these standards also provide guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition a notes to consolidated financial statements continued various taxing authorities periodically audit the companys income tax returns these audits include questions regarding the companys tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes the company records allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years through the assessment of the companys tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the companys various filing positions self insurance costs the company is primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis the company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits the following table summarizes the changes in the companys self insurance liability through january beginning balance expense claim payments ending balance less current portion long term portion the current portion of the self insured liability is included in other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the company is also similarly self insured for property related losses the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to losses in excess of on a per claim basis except in the case of an earthquake for which stop loss coverage is in excess of per claim up to per claim in california and outside of california revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale discounts provided to customers by the company at the time of sale including those provided in connection with loyalty cards are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold discounts provided by vendors usually in the form of paper coupons are not recognized as a reduction in sales provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons the company records a receivable from the vendor for the difference in sales price and cash received pharmacy sales are recorded when provided to the customer sales taxes are not recorded as a component of sales the company does not recognize a sale when it sells its own gift a notes to consolidated financial statements continued cards and gift certificates rather it records a deferred liability equal to the amount received a sale is then recognized when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed to purchase the companys products gift card and certificate breakage is recognized when redemption is deemed remote merchandise costs the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations includes product costs net of discounts and allowances advertising costs see separate discussion below inbound freight charges warehousing costs including receiving and inspection costs transportation costs and manufacturing production and operational costs warehousing transportation and manufacturing management salaries are also included in the merchandise costs line item however purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the operating general and administrative line item along with most of the companys other managerial and administrative costs rent expense and depreciation expense are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the companys approach is to include in the merchandise costs line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold advertising costs the companys advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations the companys pre tax advertising costs totaled in in and in the company does not record vendor allowances for co operative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense deposits in transit deposits in transit generally represent funds deposited to the companys bank accounts at the end of the year related to sales a majority of which were paid for with credit cards and checks to which the company does not have immediate access a notes to consolidated financial statements continued consolidated statements of cash flows for purposes of the

respectively and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows segments the company operates retail food and drug stores multi department stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states the companys retail operations which represent substantially all of the companys consolidated sales are its only reportable segment all of the companys operations are domestic goodwill the following table summarizes the changes in the companys net goodwill balance through january balance beginning of the year goodwill accumulated impairment losses activity during the year goodwill impairment charge goodwill recorded balance end of year goodwill accumulated impairment losses testing for impairment must be performed annually or on an interim basis upon the occurrence of a triggering event or a change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment in the third quarter of the companys operating performance suffered due to deflation and intense competition during

the acquisition does not qualify as a purchase the company believes that it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it is more likely than not that its position will be sustained however due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the litigation process there can be no assurances that the tax court will rule in favor of the company a decision on this case is expected within

charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and or seek

the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite managements current belief

derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes including rebalancing exposures to certain asset classes any use of derivative instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited unless approved in advance by the committee the current target allocations shown represent targets that were established in and revised slightly in the company will rebalance by liquidating assets whose allocation materially exceeds target if possible and investing in assets whose allocation is below target if markets are illiquid the company may not be able to rebalance to target quickly to maintain actual asset allocations consistent with target allocations assets are reallocated or rebalanced periodically in addition cash flow from employer contributions and participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes as appropriate the company expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs although the company is not required to make cash contributions to its company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the company expects to contribute approximately million to these plans in additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions the company expects any voluntary contributions made during will reduce its minimum required contributions in future years a notes to consolidated financial statements continued assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported

input that is significant to the fair value measurement the following is a description of the valuation methods used for the plans assets measured at fair value in the above two tables cash the carrying value approximates fair value corporate stocks the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded corporate bonds the fair values of these securities are primarily based on observable market quotations for identical or similar bonds valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded when such quoted prices are not available the bonds are valued using a discounted cash flows approach using current yields on similar instruments of issuers with similar credit ratings including adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks u s government obligations certain u s government obligations are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded other u s government securities are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings when quoted prices are not available for identical or similar securities the security is valued under a discounted cash flows approach that maximizes observable inputs such as current yields of similar instruments but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as

within the funds which are typically traded on an active market and valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded for investments not traded on an active market or for which a quoted price is not publicly available a variety of unobservable valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow market multiple and cost valuation approaches are employed by the fund manager to value investments fair values of all investments are adjusted if necessary based on audits of the hedge fund financial statements such adjustments are reflected in the fair value of the plans assets a notes to consolidated financial statements continued private equity private equity investments are valued based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund which include investments both traded on an active market and not traded on an active market for those investments that are traded on an active market the values are based on the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded for investments not traded on an active market or for which a quoted price is not publicly available a variety of unobservable valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow market multiple and cost valuation approaches are employed by the fund manager to value investments fair values of all

estate investments include investments in real estate funds managed by a fund manager these investments are valued using a variety of unobservable valuation methodologies including discounted cash flow market multiple and cost valuation approaches the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuations methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement the company contributed and expensed and to employee k retirement savings accounts in and respectively the k retirement savings account plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service the company also administers other defined contribution plans for eligible employees the cost of these plans for and was multi employer plans the company also contributes to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of its collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans the company recognizes expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded the company made contributions to these funds and recognized expense of in in and in based on the most recent information available to it the company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits moreover if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds the company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated a notes to consolidated financial statements continued recently adopted accounting standards in december the fasb amended its existing standards to provide additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans the new standards require disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made the fair value of each major category of plan assets valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets the effect of

guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements and d requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements the

disclosures on an entitys derivative and hedging activities the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements effective february the company adopted the new standards that clarify that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of its adoption effective february the company adopted new standards related to

will be accounted for under the new standards effective february the company adopted new standards that deferred the fair value disclosures for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new standards in december the fasb amended its existing standards for a parents noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to the subsidiary the new standard defines a noncontrolling interest previously called a minority interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent the new standard requires among a notes to consolidated financial statements continued other things that a noncontrolling interest be clearly identified labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as equity but separate from the parents equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and that if a subsidiary is deconsolidated the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent retains in the former subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the non controlling equity investment the company adopted the new standard effective february and applied it retrospectively as a result the company reclassified noncontrolling interests in amounts of from the mezzanine section to equity in the january consolidated balance sheet certain reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard recorded amounts for prior periods previously presented as net earnings which are now presented as net earnings attributable to the kroger co have not changed as a result of the adoption of the new standard effective january the company adopted the amended standards related to disclosures about interests in vies these amended standards require additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets the adoption of these new amended standards did not change any disclosures in the companys consolidated financial statements due to the companys vies being immaterial recently issued accounting standards in june the fasb amended its existing standards to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the new standards will become effective for the companys fiscal year beginning january while the company is still finalizing its evaluation of the impact of these amended standards on its consolidated financial statements the company believes these new standards will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements in january the fasb issued guidance which amends and clarifies existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures this guidance requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level and reasons for such transfers and the separate presentation of purchases sales issuances and settlement in the level reconciliation it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and level fair value measurements this guidance is effective for the company for the first quarter of except for the new disclosures in the level reconciliation the level disclosures are effective for the company for the first quarter of the company does not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements guarantor subsidiaries the companys outstanding public debt the guaranteed notes is jointly and severally fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co and some of its subsidiaries the guarantor subsidiaries at january a total of approximately of guaranteed notes was outstanding the guarantor subsidiaries and non guarantor subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the kroger co separate financial statements of the kroger co and each of the guarantor subsidiaries are not presented because the guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable the company believes that separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the guarantor subsidiaries would not be material to investors a notes to consolidated financial statements continued the non guaranteeing subsidiaries represent less than on an individual and aggregate basis of consolidated assets pre tax earnings cash flow and equity therefore the non guarantor subsidiaries information is not separately presented in the tables below there are no current restrictions on the ability of the guarantor subsidiaries to make payments under the guarantees referred to above except however the
