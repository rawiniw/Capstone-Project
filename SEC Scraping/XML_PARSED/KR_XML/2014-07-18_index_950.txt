agreement kroger and the company entered into a confidentiality agreement dated as of march as amended the confidentiality agreement under the terms of the confidentiality agreement kroger agreed

for the purpose of evaluating the possible transaction the confidentiality agreement also includes a standstill provision that remains in effect for a period of two years from the date of the confidentiality agreement the above summary description of the confidentiality agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to such confidentiality agreement which kroger has filed as exhibit d to the schedule to table of contents purpose of the offer plans for the company purpose of the offer the purpose of the offer is for kroger through purchaser to acquire control of and the entire equity interest in the company the offer is intended to facilitate the acquisition of all outstanding shares the purpose of the merger is to acquire all outstanding shares not tendered and purchased pursuant to the offer if the offer is consummated purchaser intends to complete the merger as promptly as practicable thereafter the company board has approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby including the offer and the merger if the offer is consummated we do not anticipate seeking the approval of the companys remaining stockholders before effecting the merger section h of the dgcl provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation and subject to certain statutory provisions if the acquirer holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the constituent corporation that would otherwise be required to approve a merger for the constituent corporation and the other stockholders receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer the acquirer can effect a merger without the action of the other stockholders of the constituent corporation accordingly if we consummate the offer we intend to complete the merger without a vote of the companys stockholders in accordance with section h of the dgcl if we are prohibited from effecting the merger in accordance with section h of the dgcl we reserve the right to effect the merger in another manner that complies with the requirements of the dgcl plans for the company in connection with krogers consideration of the offer kroger has developed a plan on the basis of available information for the combination of the business of the company with that of kroger kroger plans to integrate the companys business into kroger kroger will continue to evaluate and refine the plan and may make changes to it as additional information is obtained except as set forth in this offer to purchase and the merger agreement kroger and purchaser have no present plans or proposals that would relate to or result in i any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the company or any of its subsidiaries such as a merger reorganization liquidation relocation of any operations or sale or other transfer of a material amount of assets ii any sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the company or any of its subsidiaries iii any material change in the companys capitalization or dividend policy or iv any other material change in the companys corporate structure or business certain effects of the offer it is expected that the merger will be consummated pursuant to section h of the dgcl promptly after the consummation of the offer immediately following the merger all of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock will be held by kroger market for the shares the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer will reduce the number of holders of shares and the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly which could adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the remaining shares we cannot predict whether the reduction in the number of shares that might otherwise trade publicly would have an adverse or beneficial effect on the market price for or marketability of the shares or whether such reduction would cause future market prices to be greater or less than the offer price stock quotation depending upon the number of shares purchased pursuant to the offer the shares may no longer meet the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq global market if among other things the company does not meet the requirements for the number of publicly held shares the aggregate market value of the publicly held shares or the number of market makers for the shares kroger will seek to cause the listing of shares on the nasdaq global market to be discontinued as soon after the consummation of the offer as the requirements for termination of the listing are satisfied table of contents if the nasdaq global market were to delist the shares it is possible that the shares would continue to trade on other securities exchanges or in the over the counter market and that price or other quotations of the shares would be reported by other sources the extent of the public market for such shares and the availability of such quotations would depend however upon such factors as the number of stockholders and the aggregate market value of such securities remaining at such time the interest in maintaining a market in the shares on the part of securities firms the possible termination of registration under the exchange act and other factors margin regulations the shares are currently margin securities under the regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board which has the effect among other things of allowing brokers to extend credit based on the use of shares as collateral depending upon factors similar to those described above regarding the market for the shares and stock quotations it is possible that following the offer the shares would no longer constitute margin securities for the purposes of the margin regulations of the federal reserve board and therefore could no longer be used as collateral for loans made by brokers exchange act registration the shares are currently registered under the exchange act such registration may be terminated upon application of the company to the sec if the shares are neither listed on a national securities exchange nor held by or more holders of record termination of registration of the shares under the exchange act would substantially reduce the information required to be furnished by the company to its stockholders and to the sec and would make certain provisions of the exchange act no longer applicable to the company such as the short swing profit recovery provisions of section b of the exchange act the requirement of furnishing a proxy statement pursuant to section a of the exchange act in connection with stockholders meetings and the related requirement of furnishing an annual report to stockholders and the requirements of rule e under the exchange act with respect to going private transactions furthermore the ability of affiliates of the company and persons holding restricted securities of the company to dispose of such securities pursuant to rule under the securities act of as amended may be impaired or eliminated if registration of the shares under the exchange act were terminated the shares would no longer be margin securities or be eligible for listing on the nasdaq global market we intend to cause the delisting of the shares from the nasdaq global market and the termination of the registration of the shares under the exchange act as soon after completion of the merger as the requirements for such delisting and termination of registration are satisfied dividends and distributions the merger agreement provides that from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger agreement and the acceptance time except as approved by kroger which approval will not be unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed the company will not declare set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution whether in cash shares or property or any combination thereof in respect of any shares of capital stock or make any other actual constructive or deemed distribution in respect of the shares of capital

or the merger in the united states table of contents certain legal matters regulatory approvals general based on our examination of publicly available information filed by the company with the sec and other publicly available information concerning the company we are not aware of any governmental license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to the companys business that would be adversely affected by our acquisition of shares pursuant to the offer or except as set forth below in this section of any approval or other action by any government or governmental administrative or regulatory authority or agency domestic or foreign that would be required for our purchase of shares pursuant to the offer should any such approval or other action be required or desirable we currently contemplate that except for takeover laws in jurisdictions other than delaware as described below under state takeover laws such approval or other action will be sought however except for observance of the waiting periods summarized under antitrust compliance below in this section we do not anticipate delaying the purchase of shares tendered pursuant to the offer pending the outcome of any such matter there can be no assurance that any such approval or action if needed will be obtained or if obtained that it will be obtained without substantial conditions and there can be no assurance that in the event that such approvals were not obtained or such other actions were not taken adverse consequences might not result to the companys business or that certain parts of the companys business might not have to be disposed of or held separate any of which may give us the right to terminate the offer at any expiration date without accepting for payment any shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the offer our obligation under the offer to accept for payment and pay for shares is subject to the conditions to the offer including among other conditions the antitrust condition see section conditions of the offer antitrust compliance under the hsr act including the related rules and regulations that have been promulgated thereunder by the u s federal trade commission the ftc certain acquisition transactions including purchasers purchase of shares pursuant to the offer may not be consummated until certain information and documentary material has been furnished for review by the ftc and the antitrust division of the u s department of justice the antitrust division and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied pursuant to the hsr act on july kroger and the company filed their respective premerger notification and report forms with the ftc and the antitrust division under the hsr act purchasers purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer is subject to an initial waiting period that will expire at pm edt on july however the initial waiting period may be terminated prior to such date and time by the ftc and the antitrust division or we may receive a request a second request for additional information or documentary material from either the ftc or the antitrust division prior to such expiration if the ftc or the antitrust division issues a second request the waiting period with respect to the offer will be extended for an additional period of calendar days which will begin on the date on which we have substantially complied with the second request complying with a second request can take a significant period of time if either the day or day waiting period expires on a saturday sunday or federal holiday then such waiting period will be extended until p m of the next day that is not a saturday sunday or federal holiday only one extension of the waiting period pursuant to a second request is authorized by the hsr act after that time the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with our consent the ftc or the antitrust division may terminate the additional day waiting period before its expiration the ftc and the antitrust division frequently scrutinize the legality under the u s antitrust laws of transactions like the offer and the merger at any time the ftc or the antitrust division could take any action under the antitrust laws that it considers necessary or desirable in the public interest including seeking i to enjoin the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer ii to enjoin the merger iii to require purchaser or after completion of the merger kroger to divest the shares or iv to require us or the company to divest substantial assets private parties as well as state attorneys general also may bring legal actions under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances see section conditions of the offer table of contents based upon an examination of publicly available information and other information relating to the businesses in which the company is engaged we and the company believe that neither the purchase of shares by purchaser pursuant to the offer nor the consummation of the merger should violate applicable antitrust laws nevertheless neither we nor the company can be certain that a challenge to the offer or the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or if such challenge is made what the result will be see section conditions of the offer state takeover laws the company is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in general section of the dgcl prevents a delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination defined to include mergers and certain other actions with an interested stockholder including a person who owns or has the right to acquire or more of a corporations outstanding voting stock for a period of three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless among other things the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation before such person became an interested stockholder the company board approved the merger agreement on july and therefore section of the dgcl is inapplicable to the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein a number of states have adopted laws and regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are incorporated or have substantial assets stockholders principal executive offices or principal places of business or whose business operations otherwise have substantial economic effects in such states in in edgar v mite corp the supreme court of the united states invalidated on constitutional grounds the illinois business takeover statute which as a matter of state securities law made takeovers of corporations meeting certain requirements more difficult however in in cts corp v dynamics corp of america the supreme court held that the state of indiana could as a matter of corporate law constitutionally disqualify a potential acquirer from voting shares of a target corporation without the prior approval of the remaining stockholders where among other things the corporation is incorporated and has a substantial number of stockholders in the state subsequently in tlx acquisition corp v telex corp a u s federal district court in oklahoma ruled that the oklahoma statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside oklahoma in that they would subject such corporations to inconsistent regulations similarly in tyson foods inc v mcreynolds a u s federal district court in tennessee ruled that four tennessee takeover statutes were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside tennessee this decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit in december a u s federal district court in florida held in grand metropolitan plc v butterworth that the provisions of the florida affiliated transactions act and the florida control share acquisition act were unconstitutional as applied to corporations incorporated outside of florida the company directly or through subsidiaries conducts business in a number of states throughout the united states some of which have enacted takeover laws we do not know whether any of these laws will by their terms apply to the offer or the merger and have not attempted to comply with any such laws should any person seek to apply any state takeover law we will take such action as then appears desirable which may include challenging the validity or applicability of any such statute in appropriate court proceedings in the event any person asserts that the takeover laws of any state are applicable to the offer or the merger and an appropriate court does not determine that it is inapplicable or invalid as applied to the offer or the merger we may be required to file certain information with or receive approvals from the relevant state authorities in addition if enjoined we may be unable to accept for payment any shares tendered pursuant to the offer or be delayed in continuing or consummating the offer and the merger in such case we may not be obligated to accept for payment any shares tendered in the offer see section conditions of the offer table of contents legal proceedings following the july announcement that the company had entered into the merger agreement two putative class actions were filed on behalf of purported stockholders of the company against the company its directors kroger and purchaser the actions are captioned john ernst v vitacost com inc et al ca which was filed on july in the circuit court of the fifteenth judicial circuit in and for palm beach county florida the ernst action and marcel heim v vitacost com inc et al c a no vcp which was filed on july in the court of chancery of the state of delaware together with the ernst action the stockholder actions each of the stockholder actions alleges that the companys directors breached their fiduciary duties to the companys stockholders in connection with their consideration and approval of the merger agreement by among other things agreeing to an inadequate tender price through an inadequate sales process the stockholder actions also allege that the company kroger and purchaser aided and abetted the companys directors alleged breaches of fiduciary duty the stockholder actions seek among other things an injunction to prevent consummation of the offer and subsequent merger appraisal rights no appraisal rights are available to the holders of shares in connection with the offer if the merger is completed appraisal rights will be available in connection with the merger as further described below but although the availability of appraisal rights depends on the merger being completed stockholders who wish to exercise such appraisal rights must do so no later than the time of the consummation of the offer even though the merger will not have been completed as of such time if the merger is completed the holders of shares who i did not tender their shares in the offer ii follow the procedures set forth in section of the dgcl and iii do not thereafter lose their appraisal rights by withdrawal failure to perfect or otherwise in each case in accordance with the dgcl will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the delaware court of chancery and receive payment of the fair value of such shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger together with a fair rate of interest as determined by such court the fair value of any shares could be based upon considerations other than or in addition to the price paid in the offer and the market value of such shares moreover the fair value so determined could be higher or lower than or the same as the offer price moreover we may argue in an appraisal proceeding that for purposes of such proceeding the fair value of such shares is less than the offer price section of the dgcl provides that if a merger was approved pursuant to section h either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or the surviving corporation within ten days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation and shall include in such notice a copy of section of the dgcl as described more fully in the schedule d if a stockholder wishes to elect to exercise appraisal rights under section of the dgcl such stockholder must do all of the following no later than the consummation of the offer deliver to the company a written demand for appraisal of shares held which demand must reasonably inform the company of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder is demanding appraisal not tender such stockholders shares in the offer and table of contents continuously hold of record the shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made through the effective time the foregoing summary of the appraisal rights of stockholders under the dgcl does not purport to be a complete statement of the procedures to be followed by stockholders desiring to exercise any appraisal rights available thereunder and is qualified in its entirety by reference to section of the dgcl the proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict and timely adherence to the applicable provisions of the dgcl a copy of section of the dgcl will be provided to each
