approximately million pension contributions expenses company sponsored pension plans we expect expense to be approximately million we made a cash contribution in of approximately million k plan for we expect a slight increase in our cash contributions and expense compared to multi employer plans in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension funds labor in the remainder of we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in memphis and with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations negotiations are challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for good wages and affordable health care also we must address the underfunding of taft

dividend the companys business model is expected to generate total shareholder return of approximately to krogers goal is to produce an average annual return for shareholders that matches or exceeds the sp index over the time horizon described above but with less volatility kroger is in the middle of the business planning process and full guidance will be provided in march based on what the company is seeing today the company expects to reach to annual earnings per share growth in plus a dividend of to this does not factor in the rd week in fiscal year our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals our ability to achieve results near the top end of our earnings guidance range our ability to continue to invest in the four key components of our customer ststrategy our ability to strike a balance between delivering solid near term financial results and investing for the future growth of our business and our ability to deliver operating margins at projected levels may be affected by labor disputes particularly as the company seeks to manage health care and pension costs industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions unexpected changes in product costs the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions the number of shares outstanding the success of our future growth plans goodwill impairment changes in government funded benefit programs volatility in our fuel margins increased fuel costs and the effect those increases have on consumer spending our ability to maintain good cost control and to consistently reduce the overall cost to run our business and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition and sales shifts to other stores that we operate as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation our guidance for lifo is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year our non fuel operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations our ability to pass along product cost increases will depend primarily upon the reactions of our customers and our competitors to those increases our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected the accuracy of our product cost inflation estimate will depend primarily on weather conditions supply constraints unrest in areas of the country in which products are grown or are produced natural disasters and the general economic climate we could fail to achieve fuel margins of per gallon for the last quarter of the year if variability in fuel costs continues our capital expenditures and the number of projects that we complete could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores development costs vary from those budgeted our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing of completion of projects our ability to use cash flow from operations and cash on hand to maintain our current debt rating fund capital expenditures repurchase shares and pay dividends could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings any change in tax laws the regulations related thereto the applicable accounting rulesor standards or the interpretation thereof by federal state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate should asset values in the multi employer pension funds further deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated our incremental expense from rising pension and health care costs could exceed our expectations if health care costs continue to rise faster than projected if unforeseen medical expenses are incurred under our self insured health benefit plans or if the assumptions used to estimate pension expenses differ from actual experience the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation our ability to achieve anticipated operating margins could be affected by all of the factors outlined above that could cause us to fail to achieve our expected earnings and earnings per share growth section financial statements and exhibits item financial statements and
