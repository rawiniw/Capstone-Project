board held five meetings in fiscal year during fiscal year all incumbent directors attended at least of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and committees on which that director served members of the board are expected to use their best efforts to attend all annual meetings of shareholders all thirteen members then serving on the board attended last years annual meeting compensation consultants the compensation committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for our executive officers in kroger paid that consultant for work performed for the committee kroger on managements recommendation retained the parent and affiliated companies of mercer human resource consulting to provide other services for kroger in for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to insurance claims for which kroger was reimbursed by insurance carriers as claims were adjusted insurance brokerage and bonding commissions and pension consulting kroger also made payments to affiliated companies for insurance premiums that were collected by the affiliated companies on behalf of insurance carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers although neither the committee nor the board expressly approved the other services after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the committee determined that the consultant is independent and his work has not raised any conflict of interest because a the consultant was first engaged by the committee before he became associated with mercer b the consultant works exclusively for the committee and not for our management c the consultant does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and d neither the consultant nor the consultants team perform any other services for kroger the committee may engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable compensation committee interlocks and insider participation no member of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of kroger during fiscal year and no member of the compensation committee is a former officer of the company or was a party to any disclosable related person transaction involving the company during fiscal year none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers serving as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of the company board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board is responsible for the overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control that exposure the audit committee also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management including our chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective board committees regarding the management of the risks they oversee and each of these committees reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board in addition to the reports from the committees the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo addresses matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess interrelationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by the lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr mcmullen as chairman of the board and ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls board leadership structure and lead director the board is composed of ten independent non employee directors and one management director mr mcmullen the chairman and ceo the board has established five standing committees audit compensation corporate governance financial policy and public responsibilities each committee is composed solely of independent directors each with a different independent director serving as committee chair in addition as provided in the guidelines on issues of corporate governance the board has designated one of the independent directors as lead director the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving board meeting agendas materials and schedules to confirm the appropriate topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each serving as liaison between the chairman management and the non management directors presiding at the executive sessions of independent directors and at all other meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present calling an executive session of independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication following a request with major shareholders unless otherwise determined by the board the chair of the corporate governance committee is designated as the lead director robert beyer an independent director and the chair of the corporate governance committee is currently the lead director mr beyer is an effective lead director for kroger due to among other things his independence his deep strategic and operational understanding of kroger obtained while serving as a kroger director his insight into corporate governance and his experience on other boards with respect to the roles of chairman and ceo the guidelines provide that the board will determine when it is in the best interests of kroger and our shareholders for the roles to be separated or combined and the board exercises its discretion as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances upon retirement of our former chairman david b dillon on december the board determined that it is in the best interests of kroger and our shareholders for one person to serve as the chairman and ceo as was the case from through the board believes that this leadership structure improves the boards ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps the company operate in the long term interests of shareholders additionally this structure provides an effective balance between strong company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent directors the board believes that the combination or separation of these positions should continue to be considered as part of the succession planning process as was the case in and when the roles were separated the board and each of its committees conduct an annual self evaluation to determine whether they are functioning effectively as part of this annual self evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders the guidelines provide the flexibility for the board to modify our leadership structure in the future as appropriate we believe that kroger like many u s companies has been well served by this flexible leadership structure compensation discussion and analysis executive compensation overview as one of the largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy remains to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our focus on our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that align with our business strategy this compensation discussion and analysis provides a discussion and analysis of our compensation program for the executive officers for the fiscal year ended january the named executive officers were name title w rodney mcmullen chairman and chief executive officer j michael schlotman senior vice president and chief financial officer michael l ellis president and chief operating officer kathleen s barclay senior vice president of human resources michael j donnelly senior vice president of merchandising david b dillon former chairman the compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal year reflects the above principles total compensation for the year is an indicator of how well kroger performed compared to our business plan reflecting how our compensation program responds to business challenges and the marketplace we continue to deliver sales growth and positive earnings results a key metric identical supermarket sales excluding supermarket fuel increased from through fiscal we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth net earnings per diluted share were which exceeded our guidance range in september the board raised the quarterly cash dividend by to per share the committee believes our management produced outstanding results in measured against increasingly aggressive business plan objectives for sales net earnings operating costs and our strategic plan the compensation paid to our named executive officers reflected this fact as the annual performance based cash bonus paid out at of bonus potentials the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of past years annual cash bonus such as and with payouts of less than in those years we did not achieve all of our business plan objectives in all of our business plan goals were exceeded with the exception of a set of measures under our strategic plan goal which fell short resulting in an annual bonus payout that exceeded of potentials in keeping with our overall compensation philosophy we endeavor to ensure that our executive compensation practices conform to best practices in particular over the past several years we have established significant stock ownership guideline levels to reinforce the link between the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders adopted claw back policies under which the repayment of bonuses may be required in certain circumstances eliminated tax gross ups adopted the recommendation of shareholders that they be permitted annually on an advisory basis to vote on executive compensation and adopted a policy prohibiting hedging and short sales and restricting pledging of kroger common shares by our officers and directors in addition fifty percent of the equity awards granted to the named executive officers are in the form of performance units that are earned only to the extent that performance objectives are achieved equity compensation awards continue to play an important role in rewarding named executive officers for the achievement of long term business objectives and providing incentives for the creation of shareholder value the following discussion and analysis addresses the compensation of the named executive officers and the factors considered by the committee in setting compensation for the named executive officers and making recommendations to the independent directors in the case of the ceos compensation additional detail is provided in the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosures that follow this discussion and analysis results of advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting of shareholders we held our fourth annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory proposal in the committee considers this to be an overwhelmingly favorable outcome and believes it conveys our shareholders support of the committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs as a result the committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs or pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting of shareholders in keeping with our shareholders request for an annual advisory vote we will again hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the committee will continue to consider the results from this years and future advisory votes on executive compensation executive compensation objectives the committee has several related objectives regarding compensation first the committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those best suited to fulfill the challenging roles that executive officers play at kroger second some elements of compensation should help align the interests of our officers with the interests of our shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the officers a to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and b to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives in developing compensation programs and amounts to meet these objectives the committee exercises judgment to ensure that executive officer compensation is appropriate and competitive in light of krogers performance and the needs of the business stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our officers and directors with your interests as shareholders the board has adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines require non employee directors officers and some other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger common shares as set forth below position multiple of base salary chief executive officer times chief operating officer times executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents times other officers and key executives times non employee directors times annual base cash retainer covered individuals are expected to achieve the target level within five years of appointment to their position if the requirements have not been met directors officers and key executives including the named executive officers must hold of shares received upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of restricted stock except those necessary to pay the exercise price of the options and or applicable taxes and must retain all kroger shares unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo role of compensation committee the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of our executive officers including the named executive officers with the exception of the chief executive officer the committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those members of the board establish the ceos compensation establishing executive compensation the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos salary the bonus potential for the ceo the nature and amount of any equity awards made to the ceo and any other compensation decisions related to the ceo in setting the annual bonus potential for the ceo the independent directors determine the dollar amount that will be multiplied by the percentage payout under the annual bonus plan generally applicable to all corporate management including the named executive officers the independent directors retain discretion to reduce the percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive the independent directors thus make a separate determination annually concerning both the ceos bonus potential and the percentage of bonus paid the committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other named executive officers the committees annual review of compensation for the named executive officers includes the following conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the named executive officers on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each named executive officer of salary annual performance based cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation equity accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits company paid health and welfare benefits banked vacation severance benefits available under the kroger co employee protection plan and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the committee has determined that the compensation of the ceo and that of the other named executive officers bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the committees compensation consultants described below comparing named executive officer and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies primarily our competitors to ensure that the committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary bonus potential and equity awards for each of the senior officers including the other named executive officers the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team reviews of historical information regarding salary bonus and equity compensation for a three year period in considering each of the factors above the committee does not make use of a formula but rather subjectively reviews each in setting compensation compensation policies as they relate to risk management as part of the compensation committees review of our compensation practices the committee considers and analyzes the extent to which risks arise from such practices and their impact on krogers business as discussed above in the compensation discussion and analysis our policies and practices for compensating employees are designed to among other things attract and retain high quality and engaged employees in this process the committee also focuses on minimizing risk through the implementation of certain practices and policies such as the executive compensation recoupment policy which is described in more detail on page accordingly we do not believe that our compensation practices and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on kroger the committees compensation consultants and benchmarking as referenced earlier in this compensation discussion and analysis the committee directly engages a compensation consultant from mercer human resource consulting to advise the committee in the design of compensation for executive officers the mercer consultant conducts an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the committee determines compensation the consultant assesses base salary target annual performance based bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual bonus annualized long term incentive awards such as stock options restricted stock and performance based long term cash bonuses and performance based equity awards and total direct compensation the sum of all these elements the consultant compares these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded food and drug retailers for our peer group consisted of costco wholesale supervalu cvs health formerly cvs caremark target rite aid wal mart safeway walgreen boots alliance formerly walgreen this peer group is the same group as was used in the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant industry consolidation and other competitive forces will change the peer group used over time the consultant also provides the committee data from companies in general industry a representation of major publicly traded companies of similar size and scope these data serve as reference points particularly for senior staff positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector from time to time the committee will engage an additional compensation consultant to conduct an additional review of krogers executive compensation as it deems advisable considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the committee believes that salaries paid to our named executive officers should be at or above the median paid by competitors for comparable positions the committee also aims to provide an annual bonus potential to our named executive officers that if the increasingly more challenging annual business plan objectives are achieved would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our named executive officers is comprised of the following salary performance based annual cash bonus annual non equity incentive pay performance based long term compensation long term cash and performance unit incentive compensation other equity non qualified stock options and restricted stock retirement and other benefits and perquisites salary we provide our named executive officers and other employees a fixed amount of cash compensation salary for their work salaries for the named executive officers with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by the independent directors salaries for the named executive officers were reviewed in june the amount of each named executive officers salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the committee or in the case of the ceo of the committee and the rest of the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure and relationship with the salaries of other executives at kroger the assessment of individual contribution is based on a subjective determination without the use of performance targets in the following areas leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives to the extent applicable decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the officer increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values the amounts shown below reflect the salaries of the named executive officers effective august following the annual review of their compensation in june salaries w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael l ellis kathleen s barclay mike donnelly david b dillon mr mcmullens salary increased to effective upon his appointment as chairman of the board on january mr ellis first became a named executive officer in performance based annual cash bonus a large percentage of our employees at all levels including the named executive officers are eligible to receive a performance based annual cash bonus based on the performance of kroger in the case of the named executive officers or business unit in the case of employees in our business units the committee establishes bonus potentials for each named executive officer other than the ceo whose bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts which can exceed of the potential amounts but may not exceed of the potential amounts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the thresholds established by the committee actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the thresholds established by the committee the committee considers several factors in making its determination or recommendation as to bonus potentials first the individuals level within the organization is a factor in that the committee believes that more senior executives should have a substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance second the individuals salary is a factor so that a substantial portion of a named executive officers total cash compensation is dependent upon krogers performance finally the committee considers the report of its compensation consultant to assess the bonus potential of the named executive officers in light of total compensation paid to comparable executive positions in the industry the annual cash bonus potential in effect following the annual review of compensation in june for each named executive officer is shown below actual bonus payouts are prorated to reflect changes if any to bonus potentials during the year annual bonus potential w rodney mcmullen j michael schlotman michael l ellis kathleen s barclay mike donnelly david b dillon mr mcmullens annual bonus potential increased to effective upon his appointment as chairman of the board on january mr ellis first became a named executive officer in over time the committee and our independent directors have placed an increased emphasis on our strategic plan by making the targets more difficult to achieve the bonus plan allows for minimal or zero bonus to be earned at relatively low levels of performance to provide incentive for achieving even higher levels of performance the amount of bonus that the named executive officers earn each year is based upon krogers performance compared to targets established by the committee and the independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors in of the bonus was based on a target for identical sales without supermarket fuel was based on a target for ebitda without supermarket fuel was based on implementation and results of a set of measures under our strategic plan and was based on a target for total operating costs as a percentage of sales excluding fuel an additional would be earned if kroger achieved three goals with respect to its supermarket fuel operations achievement of the targeted fuel ebitda of million an increase in total gallons sold of and achievement of fuel centers placed in service the fuel bonus of is only available if all three measures are met if any of the three fuel goals are not met there is no payout under the fuel measurement kroger exceeded the three goals and as a result received the fuel bonus the targets established by the committee the actual fiscal results and the bonus percentage earned in each of the components of annual cash bonus were as follows actual performance targets actual compared to component minimum performance target amount earned identical sales without supermarket fuel ebitda without supermarket fuel billion billion billion strategic plan total operating costs as percentage of sales excluding fuel over budget by basis points over budget by basis points under budget by basis points basis pointsunder target fuel bonus as described in the text above total earned total operating costs were budgeted at as a percentage of sales for fiscal year the strategic plan component also was established by the committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive following the close of the year the committee reviewed krogers performance against the identical sales without supermarket fuel ebitda without supermarket fuel strategic plan objectives and total operating costs as a percent of sales excluding fuel and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives due to our performance when compared to the targets established by the committee and based on the business plan adopted by the board the named executive officers earned of their bonus potentials this is the same bonus percentage payout received by all other participants in the corporate annual bonus plan in as in all years the committee retained discretion to reduce the bonus payout for all executive officers including the named executive officers if the committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate given their assessment of company performance the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus those bodies also retained discretion to adjust the targets under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year no adjustments were made to the targets in the committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo determined that the bonus payouts for the named executive officers that were earned based on performance should not be adjusted the percentage paid for represented excellent performance that exceeded our business plan objectives a comparison of bonus percentages for the named executive officers in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong links to our performance annual cash bonus fiscal year percentage the actual amounts of annual performance based cash bonuses paid to the named executive officers for are reported in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table these amounts represent the bonus potentials for each named executive officer multiplied by the payout percentage earned in in no event can any participant receive a performance based annual cash bonus in excess of the maximum amount that a participant including each named executive officer can earn is further limited to of the participants bonus potential amount long term incentives the committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the named executive officers to achieve the long term goals established by the board by conditioning a significant portion of compensation on the achievement of those goals in the committee adopted the first in a series of long term performance based compensation plans designed to reward participants for their contribution to the long term performance of kroger these earlier plans provided for overlapping four year performance periods that allowed for the earning of a long term cash bonus in krogers long term incentive program was redesigned to combine the total value of our long term cash bonus and equity programs into a cohesive strategic reward for eligible executives at the vice president level and above approximately fifty percent of the plan value is performance based delivered in cash and performance units contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance measures the other fifty percent of the value is time based and delivered in stock options and restricted stock each component is described in more detail below performance based long term compensation the long term incentive plan originally adopted in provides the model for our combined plan structure each year we adopt a similar plan with the following characteristics performance is measured over a three year period between and executives including the named executive officers participate in each plan awards include both cash and performance units the cash bonus base equals the executives salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan adoption date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date as of the date of commencing participation in the plan these cash awards are separate from awards under our performance based annual cash bonus plan a fixed number of performance units is awarded to each participant the awards are paid out in kroger common shares along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares compensation under the plan is earned based on our performance against metrics established by the committee or the independent directors at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the cash bonus base and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the cash bonus base or of the number of performance units awarded in no event can a cash bonus award exceed the following table summarizes each of the long term performance based plans for the years shown plan plan plan plan performance period to to to to

performance period payout for the cash components of the plan are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation and all other compensation columns of the summary compensation table and footnotes and to that table and the common shares issued under the plan are reported in the option exercises and stock vested table and footnote to that table during kroger awarded performance units to approximately employees including the named executive officers the committee considers several factors in determining the amount of performance units awarded to the named executive officers or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors are described in the equity awards section below equity awards awards based on krogers common shares are granted periodically to the named executive officers and a large number of other employees equity participation aligns the interests of employees with your interest as shareholders and kroger historically has distributed equity awards widely the plans include both stock options and restricted stock in kroger granted stock options to approximately employees including the named executive officers the options permit the holder to purchase kroger common shares at an option price equal to the closing price of kroger common shares on the date of the grant options are granted only on one of the four dates of committee meetings conducted after krogers public release of its quarterly earnings results during kroger awarded shares of restricted stock to approximately employees including the named executive officers under krogers long term incentive plans the committee determines the vesting schedule for stock options and restricted stock during the committee granted to the named executive officers a stock options with a five year vesting schedule and b restricted stock with a three or five year vesting schedule with the exception of one award which has a one year vesting schedule as discussed earlier under stock ownership guidelines covered individuals including the named executive officers must hold of the shares received upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of restricted stock except those necessary to pay the exercise price of the options and or applicable taxes until applicable stock ownership guidelines are met unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo the committee considers several factors in determining the amount of options restricted stock and performance units awarded to the named executive officers or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding equity based and other long term compensation awarded by our competitors the officers level in the organization and the internal relationship of equity based awards within kroger individual performance and the recommendation of the ceo for all named executive officers other than the ceo the committee has long recognized that the amount of compensation provided to the named executive officers through equity based pay is often below the amount paid by our competitors relatively lower equity based awards for the named executive officers and other senior management permit a broader base of kroger employees to participate in equity awards and further emphasizes the pay for performance philosophy amounts of equity awards issued and outstanding for the named executive officers are set forth in the tables that follow this discussion and analysis retirement and other benefits kroger maintains a defined benefit and several defined contribution retirement plans for its employees the named executive officers participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding retirement benefits available to the named executive officers can be found in the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative description that follows this discussion and analysis kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the named executive officers participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year compensation deferred bears interest until paid out at the rate representing krogers cost of ten year debt in the year the rate is set as determined by the ceo and reviewed with the committee prior to the beginning of each deferral year in that rate was deferred amounts are paid out only in cash in accordance with a deferral option selected by the participant at the time the deferral election is made kroger also maintains the kroger co employee protection plan or kepp in which all of our management employees and administrative support personnel whose employment is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service are covered kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described in the plan when an employee is actually or constructively terminated without cause within two years following a change in control of kroger as defined in the plan participants are entitled to severance pay of up to months salary and bonus the actual amount is dependent upon pay level and years of service kepp can be amended or terminated by the board at any time prior to a change in control stock option restricted stock and performance unit agreements with participants in krogers long term incentive plans provide that those awards vest with options becoming immediately exercisable restrictions on restricted stock lapsing and common shares equal to of the performance units being awarded upon a change in control as described in the agreements upon mr dillons retirement the board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of kroger to amend certain of mr dillons restricted stock agreements to permit the restrictions on the restricted stock awards to lapse in accordance with the original vesting schedule provided mr dillon executed a non compete agreement which he did if mr dillon were to breach the terms of his non compete agreement the unvested restricted stock would be forfeited none of the named executive officers is party to an employment agreement perquisites the committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide the named executive officers a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in the only perquisites available to our named executive officers were premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance and premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies currently active executives including the named executive officers and retired executives are eligible for these perquisites in addition the named executive officers are entitled to the personal use of kroger aircraft which officers may lease from kroger making officers more available and allowing for a more efficient use of their time this is not considered a perquisite as we are reimbursed by the executives for the average variable cost of such use the total amount of perquisites furnished to the named executive officers is shown in the summary compensation table and described in more detail in footnote to that table executive compensation recoupment policy if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual bonus or a long term bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the committee then the officer upon demand from the committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment hedging policy after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board adopted a policy regarding hedging pledging and short sales of kroger securities kroger directors and officers are prohibited from engaging directly or indirectly in hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities in addition they are precluded from pledging kroger securities as collateral for a loan except to the extent that shares so pledged are in excess of the number of shares the individual is required to maintain in accordance with krogers share ownership guidelines more particularly described earlier in this compensation discussion and

proxy because they are among the four highest compensated officers covered employees in krogers case this group of individuals is not identical to the group of named executive officers compensation that is deemed to be performance based is excluded for purposes of the calculation and is tax deductible awards under krogers long term incentive plans when payable upon achievement of stated performance criteria should be considered performance based and the compensation paid under those plans should be tax deductible generally compensation expense related to stock options awarded to the ceo and the next four most highly compensated officers should be deductible on the other hand krogers awards of restricted stock that vest solely upon the passage of time are not performance based as a result compensation expense for those awards to the covered employees is not deductible to the extent that the related compensation expense plus any other expense for compensation that is not performance based exceeds krogers bonus plans rely on performance criteria which have been approved by shareholders as a result bonuses paid under the plans to the covered employees should be deductible by kroger krogers policy is primarily to design and administer compensation plans that support the achievement of long term strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value where it is

filed with the sec this report is submitted by the audit committee ronald l sargent chair susan j kropf susan m phillips bobby s shackouls advisory vote on executive compensation item no the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in july requires that we give our shareholders the right to approve on a nonbinding advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed earlier in this proxy statement in accordance with the secs rules as discussed earlier in the compensation discussion and analysis our compensation philosophy is a significant portion of pay should be performance based increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that align with our business strategy furthermore as previously disclosed an increased percentage of total potential compensation is performance based as opposed to time based as half of the compensation previously awarded to the named executive officers as restricted stock and earned based on the passage of time is now only earned to the extent that performance goals are achieved in addition annual and long term cash bonuses are performance based and earned only to the extent that performance goals are achieved in tying a large portion of executive compensation to achievement of short term and long term strategic and operational goals we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders the vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation rather the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement the vote is advisory this means that the vote is not binding on kroger the compensation committee of the board is responsible for establishing executive compensation in so doing that committee will consider along with all other relevant factors the results of this vote we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution

krogers regulations or otherwise the board of directors is submitting the selection of pricewaterhousecoopers llp to shareholders for ratification as it has in past years as a good corporate governance practice if the shareholders fail to ratify the selection the audit committee may but is not required to reconsider whether to retain that firm even if the selection is ratified the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of kroger and our shareholders a representative of pricewaterhousecoopers llp is expected to be present at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so the board

notified by eleven shareholders the names and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that they intend to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the kroger company human rights risk assessment resolved that shareholders of the kroger company kroger urge the board to report to shareholders at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information on krogers process for identifying and analyzing potential and actual human rights risks of krogers operations and supply chain referred to herein as a human rights risk assessment addressing the following human rights principles used to frame the assessment frequency of assessment methodology used to track and measure performance nature and extent of consultation with relevant stakeholders in connection with the assessment how the results of the assessment are incorporated into company policies and decision making the report should be made available to shareholders on krogers website no later than october supporting statement as long term shareholders we favor policies and practices that protect and enhance the value of our investments there is increasing recognition that company risks related to human rights violations such as litigation reputational damage and project delays and disruptions can adversely affect shareholder value kroger like many other companies has adopted a supplier code of conduct see the kroger company standard vendor agreement but has yet to publish a company wide human rights policy addressing human rights issues and a separate human rights code that applies to its suppliers adoption of these principles would be an important first step in effectively managing human rights risks companies must then assess risks to shareholder value of human rights practices in their operations and supply chains to translate principles into protective practices the importance of human rights risk assessment is reflected in the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights the ruggie principles approved by the un human rights council in the ruggie principles urge that business enterprises should carry out human rights due diligenceaccessing actual and potential human rights impacts integrating and acting upon the findings tracking responses and communicating how impacts are addressed http www business humanrights org media documents ruggie ruggie guiding principles mar l pdf krogers business exposes it to significant human rights risks as of year end kroger operations including supermarkets convenience and jewelry stores are located in over states with suppliers in countries around the world including iran china and malaysia the companys supply chain is complex and global and unsuccessful labor negotiations supply chain interruptions and civil unrest could adversely affect the companys ability to execute its strategic plan we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the importance of ensuring basic human rights are recognized by those seeking to do business with us in the past months we have undertaken a number of steps to improve our social responsibility and compliance programs an internal team of kroger leaders has been working in the past year to evaluate and assess our current and future efforts with regard to social responsibility and compliance we looked at our supply chain and identified key areas where we believe additional supply chain audits especially with regard to social responsibility would be beneficial the specific items we have undertaken are we have revised and updated our vendor code of conduct it will be published in our sustainability report we have updated our existing social audit protocol to better align with industry best practices and recommended standards this audit will be required for kroger suppliers that are being audited we will choose which suppliers to audit based on various risk variables such as country product and industry we are significantly increasing the number of social compliance audits that we will conduct in future years beginning with our strategy includes adding new compliance audit managers to our team this team will be responsible for reviewing social compliance audits assessing risks as described above and developing a reporting structure that informs our business decisions our sustainability report will include a more in depth report on our social compliance activities this will include our revised vendor code of conduct a description of our and beyond social compliance audit strategy and our approach to identifying risks these are the initial steps that we will be taking and we expect our program to continue to evolve and develop based on new trends input from suppliers customers government and non governmental organizations we believe that these efforts represent significant and positive steps forward for our companys social compliance program as such we do not believe that the requested report would serve to benefit our shareholders and that preparation of a report different from what will be included in our sustainability report would divert resources that otherwise could be more appropriately used in the best interest of our shareholders this proposal covers the same subject matter as one submitted to a vote at the last four years annual meetings and was defeated by our shareholders shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by four shareholders the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that they intend to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas a portion of kroger house brand product packaging is unrecyclable including plastics which are a growing component of marine litter authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life spreads toxics and poses a potential threat to human health plastic is the fastest growing form of packaging u s flexible plastic sales are estimated at billion dried fruit frozen meat cheese and dog food are some of the kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches private label items account for a quarter of all sales nearly billion annually using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources william mcdonough a leading green design advisor calls pouch packaging a monstrous hybrid designed to end up either in a landfill or incinerator recyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious yet recycling rates stagnate only of plastic packaging is recycled according to the environmental protection agency epa billions of pouches and similar plastic laminates representing significant amounts of embedded value lie buried in landfills unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways a recent assessment of marine debris by a panel of the global environment facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled in the marine environment plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food studies by the epa suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets one study of fish from the north pacific found one or more plastic chemicals in all fish tested independent of location and species california spends nearly million annually preventing trash much of it packaging from polluting beaches rivers and oceanfront making all packaging recyclable if possible is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by ocean debris companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging other companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability procter gamble and colgate palmolive agreed to make most of their packaging recyclable by keurig green mountain will k cup coffee pods recyclable and mcdonalds and dunkin donuts shifted away from foam plastic cups which cannot be readily recycled resolved shareowners of kroger request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging supporting statement proponents believe that the report should include an assessment of the reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging and if possible goals and a timeline to phase out unrecyclable packaging the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger shares the proponents concerns regarding plastic recyclability and recognizes the important role we play as a good steward of the environment we continue to improve the recyclability of our corporate branded products we follow a balanced multi pronged approach to optimize packaging designs that consider attributes including but not limited to food safety shelf life availability quality material type function recyclability and cost kroger is increasingly labeling corporate branded products that can be recycled per the federal trade commissions green guides prompting our customers to please recycle examples include banner brand water bottles which are made from polyethylene terephthalate pete one of the most widely recycled plastics available our banner branded bread bags are made from low density polyethylene ldpe which can be recycled at most of our stores as part of the plastic bag recycling program kroger also works with various industry experts and forums to advocate for expanded recycling infrastructure to support multiple forms of plastic packaging and to support diversion from landfills for example polypropylene pp has many properties and desirable traits for our banner brand ice cream such as easy opening and reclosing and longer shelf life it allows us to use less material by weight due to its strength than other polymers while not yet widespread it is increasingly being accepted at curbside programs for each of the past several years we have published online our annual sustainability report that highlights our sustainability initiatives and waste reduction efforts in greater detail we will continue to support efforts to reduce waste find optimized solutions and advocate for expanded recycling infrastructure we believe these efforts are significant and meaningful this proposal requests that kroger take additional steps to report on an assessment of the environmental impact of unrecyclable packaging we believe that the requested report would serve little benefit to our shareholders and preparation of a report would divert resources that otherwise could be more appropriately used in the best interests of our shareholders shareholder proposal item no we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas antibiotic resistance has become a public health crisis superbugs bacteria immune or resistant to one or more antibiotics infect over million people in the u s and kill over annually according to the centers for disease control and prevention as resistance increases medications used to treat human infections lose their effectiveness leading the world health organization to warn of a post antibiotic era an important cause of antibiotic resistant bacteria is the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production for the routine non therapeutic purposes of promoting faster growth or preventing instead of treating illness in the u s more than of medically important antibiotics are sold for use on food animals calls to restrict or ban the routine use of medically important antibiotics for food animals have been endorsed by the american medical association american public health association and other leading health organizations eating food contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria is one way in which superbugs can be transmitted from a farm to human population government testing of raw supermarket meat detected superbug versions of salmonella e coli or other bacteria in of ground turkey of ground beef and of chicken sampled an outbreak of antibiotic resistant salmonella from chicken last year resulted in more than known illnesses several kroger private brand chicken products were recalled by foster farms as part of this outbreak a consumer reports survey concluded that the majority of consumers surveyed were extremely or very concerned about the use of antibiotics in animal feed and would spend more for meat produced without these drugs companies including whole foods panera bread chipotle and chik fil a have policies against purchasing meat produced with antibiotics heightening the risks to companies not acting on this issue perdue foods announced that it has phased out routine antibiotic use in the production of its chicken meat demonstrating that meat can be produced on a large scale without overusing antibiotics kroger is one of the largest supermarket chains in the nation with perishable food including meat and deli items accounting for around of the companys revenue in consequently food quality and safety trends should be of top priority to the company kroger faces reputational risk and liability concerns if it sells meat containing antibiotic resistant bacteria resolved shareholders request that the board undertake and publish a study of policy options that could reduce or eliminate routine antibiotic use in the production of its private label brand meats supporting statement proponents suggest that the board explore policy options such as the following adopt a time bound plan to phase out purchases of meat produced with routine antibiotic use establish a new procurement policy that gives preference to suppliers that meet these standards public declaration of such preferences routine antibiotic use means using antibiotics on food animals that belong to the same classes of drugs administered to humans for the non therapeutic purposes of growth promotion or disease prevention the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons as one of the largest retailers of natural and organic food kroger offers a wide variety of private label and national brand antibiotic free meat items in our stores in we introduced our private label simple truth and simple truth organic brands of natural and organic products all of the meat items with the simple truth and simple truth organic label are antibiotic free and are available in our stores this includes beef pork and poultry many of our customers have indicated a preference for antibiotic free meat items in fact sales of simple truth and simple truth organic and other antibiotic free items have increased significantly in the past several years and we expect to see continued growth in these items thats why we are continuing to offer new antibiotic free items and working with suppliers as they transition their products to antibiotic free we will continue to monitor the purchasing practices of our customers and will continue to meet their demand to the extent our suppliers are able to do so we do not believe however that given current customer preferences and availability of product it is appropriate to immediately phase out all non antibiotic free meats or set a date certain for when a transition should be complete as such we believe that the requested report would serve little benefit to our shareholders and preparation of a report would divert resources that otherwise could be more appropriately used in the best interests of our shareholders shareholder proposals and

banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores combo stores multi department stores marketplace stores or price impact warehouses the combo store is the primary food store format they typically draw customers from a mile radius we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping including natural food and organic sections pharmacies general merchandise pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce multi department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store multi department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel home fashion and furnishings outdoor living electronics automotive products toys and fine jewelry marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi department stores they offer full service grocery pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel home goods and toys price impact warehouse stores offer a no frills low cost warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide

items excluding the adjusted items net earnings for totaled billion or per diluted share compared to net earnings in of billion or per diluted share excluding the adjusted items we believe adjusted

operations our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for represent a increase compared to please refer to the net earnings section of mda for more information our identical supermarket sales increased excluding fuel in compared to we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth we continue to gain market share we focus on identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel as it is a key performance target for our long term growth strategy increasing market share is an important part of our long term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service based on

non gaap financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other gaap measure of performance adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in evaluating our results of operations as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of operating performance since as adjusted those earnings relate more directly to our day to day operations management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as a performance metric for management incentive programs and to

alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day to day merchandising and operational effectiveness since fuel discounts are earned based on in store purchases fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts which are allocated to our in store supermarket location departments we also derive oga rent and depreciation and amortization expenses through the use of estimated allocations in the

domestic manufacturing deduction and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes the benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction was greater than and due to the amendment of prior years tax returns to claim additional benefit available in years still under review by the internal revenue service the tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of the utilization of tax credits the favorable resolution of certain tax issues and other changes partially offset by the effect of state income taxes common share repurchase programs we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with rule b of the securities exchange act of and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares from time to time we made open market purchases of our common shares totaling billion in million in and billion in under these repurchase programs in addition to these repurchase programs we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit from these exercises we repurchased approximately million in million in and million in of our common shares under the stock option program a the shares repurchased in were acquired under three separate share repurchase programs the first is a million repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on october the second is a billion repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on march that replaced the first referenced program the third is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in our stock option and long term incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits on june we announced a new million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors replacing the billion repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors on march as of

activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions return on invested capital we calculate return on invested capital roic by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter of the last four quarters and dividing by two we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts roic is a non gaap financial measure of performance roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures excluding certain adjustments to operating profit a although roic is a relatively standard financial term numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roic as a result the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies the following table provides a calculation of roic for and the calculation of the numerator in the table below only includes harris teeter in the calculation of the denominator excludes the assets and liabilities recorded as of

are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital harris teeters invested capital has been excluded from the calculation for due to the merger being completed at the end of a critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from those estimates we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims the liabilities represent our best estimate using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known for both workers compensation and general liability claims we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million general liability claims are not discounted the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability which can affect the liability recorded for such claims for example variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized similarly changes in legal trends and interpretations as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs we perform an impairment calculation comparing projected undiscounted cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in million in and million in we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense a the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation the economy and market competition application of alternative assumptions and definitions such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of january we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and also upon the occurrence of triggering events we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively reporting units that have goodwill balances fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment we base projected future cash flows on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if we identify potential for impairment we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value in goodwill increased million due to our merger with vitacost com which closed on august in addition goodwill increased million in and million in due to our merger with harris teeter which closed on january for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price for vitacost com and harris teeter refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the annual evaluation of goodwill performed for our other reporting units during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment based on current and future expected cash flows we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably likely a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and see note to the consolidated financial statements the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates application of alternative estimates and assumptions such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level could produce significantly different results the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation business valuations in the market the economy and market competition store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to earnings in the proper period we estimate subtenant income future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets inflation rates and general economic conditions a we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings if any in merchandise costs we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred post retirement benefit plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet we record as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans our methodology for selecting the discount rates was to match the plans cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plans projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant we utilized a discount rate of and as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january by approximately million to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by kroger for we considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in we decreased our assumed pension plan investment return rate to compared to in and our pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december net of investment management fees and expenses increased for the past years our average annual rate of return has been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations we believe a rate of return assumption is reasonable for see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets on january we adopted new mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in calculating our year end pension obligation the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increase our benefit obligation and future expenses we used the rp projected mortality table in calculating our year end pension obligation and and pension expense a sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of krogers pension plan liabilities is illustrated below in millions projected benefit percentage obligation expense point change decrease increase decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets in we did not contribute to our company sponsored defined benefit plans and do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in we contributed million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of contributions we contributed and expensed million in million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts the increase in is due to the effect of our merger with harris teeter the k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions plan compensation and length of service multi employer pension plans we contribute to various multi employer pension plans including the ufcw consolidated pension plan based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements we are designated as the named fiduciary of the ufcw consolidated pension plan and have sole investment authority over these assets these multi employer pension plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans in the first quarter of we incurred a charge of million after tax related to commitments and withdrawal liabilities associated with the restructuring of pension plan agreements of which million was contributed to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in we are required to contribute an additional million over the next four years related to the restructuring of these pension plan agreements we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan when commitments are made in accordance with gaap we made cash contributions to these plans of million in million in and million in the cash contributions for include our million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of based on the most recent information available to us we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of the multi employer plans to which we contribute substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets i e the amount of underfunding as of december because we are only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of our contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing our share of the underfunding nonetheless the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of ours or of any employer except as noted above as of december we estimate that our share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which we contribute was billion pre tax or billion after tax this represents an increase in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately million pre tax or million after tax as of december compared to december the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to lower than expected returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans during our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable a we have made and disclosed this estimate not because except as noted above this underfunding is a direct liability of ours rather we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years finally underfunding means that in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with gaap the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments the amount could decline and our future expense would be favorably affected if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or favorable legislation on the other hand our share of the underfunding could increase and our future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining trustee action or adverse legislation we continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of ours any commitments to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi employer pension plans uncertain tax positions we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes we record allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of our and federal tax returns tax years through remain under examination the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award in addition we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award over the period the award restrictions lapse inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market in total approximately of inventories in and were valued using the lifo method cost for the balance of the inventories including substantially all fuel inventories was determined using the fifo method replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by billion at january and february we follow the link chain dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit a we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions this method involves counting each item in inventory assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory in addition substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold in most cases vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold we recognized approximately billion in and billion in and of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns recently adopted accounting standards in february the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure of information about amounts reclassified out of aoci by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income in which the item was reclassified if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it requires cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period this new disclosure became effective for us beginning february and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard see note to the consolidated financial statements for our disclosures related to this amended standard in july the fasb amended accounting standards codification income taxes the amendment provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit as either a reduction of a deferred tax asset or as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists this amendment became effective for us beginning february and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on net income and did not have a significant effect on the consolidated balance sheets recently issued accounting standards in may fasb issued accounting standards update asu revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition the standards core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending january early adoption is not permitted we are currently in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption of this asu on the consolidated financial statements a liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in compared to billion

partially by the payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and a reduction in commercial paper of million liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months we have approximately billion of commercial paper and million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months which is included in the billion in estimated liquidity needs we expect to refinance this debt in by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience we also currently plan to continue repurchases of common shares under the companys share repurchase programs we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper cp program at january we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility if our short term credit ratings fall the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility under which we believe we have sufficient capacity however in the event of a ratings decline we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating the interest cost on borrowings under the credit a facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio as of march we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding the decrease as of march compared to year end was due to applying cash from operations against our year end cp outstanding borrowings our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility these financial covenants and ratios are described below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio were to exceed to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired in addition our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense as defined in the credit facility was to as of january if this ratio fell below to we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments based on year of maturity or settlement as of january in millions of dollars

facilities operated by third parties and outside service contracts any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long

june outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement as of january we had billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january in addition to the available credit mentioned above as of january we had authorized for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of ours as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and in some instances availability of these bonds may become more limited which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds if this does become an issue we would issue letters of credit in states where allowed against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties and various other remedies available to us we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities in addition to the above we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to us indemnities related to the sale of our securities indemnities of directors officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about our future performance these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it such statements are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially a statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal year which is consistent with our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of growing off of adjusted net earnings of per diluted share we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in fiscal year we expect full year fifo non fuel operating margin for to expand slightly compared to excluding the adjusted items for we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily to maintain our current investment grade debt rating fund capital investments fund our cash dividend and repurchase shares of common stock we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations we expect capital investments excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be billion we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before mergers acquisitions and operational closings for we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately excluding the resolution of certain tax items and potential changes to tax legislation we do not anticipate goodwill impairments in for we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension funds we continue to evaluate and address our potential exposure to under funded multi employer pension plans although these liabilities are not a direct obligation or liability of kroger any new agreements that would commit us to fund certain multi employer plans will be expensed when our commitment is probable and an estimate can be made in we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in columbus denver las vegas louisville memphis and portland and agreements with the teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for solid wages and good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets our ability to use cash flow to continue to maintain our investment grade debt rating and repurchase shares fund dividends and increase capital investments could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings a our ability to achieve sales earnings and cash flow goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending volatility of fuel margins changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third party payors consolidation in the health care industry including pharmacy benefit managers our ability to negotiate modifications to multi employer pension plans natural disasters or adverse weather conditions the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber attacks or data security breaches the success of our future growth plans and the successful integration of harris teeter our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above our capital investments could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if economic conditions fail to improve or worsen during the first three quarters of each fiscal year our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense is affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs our fiscal year lifo charge is affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on krogers business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information

its operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively reporting units that have goodwill balances generally fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings or discounted projected future cash flows and is compared to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment projected future cash flows are based on managements knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future if potential for impairment is identified the fair value of a reporting unit is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities excluding goodwill to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain triggering events have occurred these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset when a triggering event occurs an impairment calculation is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores to the carrying value for those stores if the company identifies impairment for long lived assets to be held and used the company compares the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value fair value is based on current market values or discounted future cash flows the company records impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal the company recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling and a notes to consolidated financial statements continued in and respectively costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets for each of the years presented have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as operating general and administrative expense store closing costs the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date net of estimated subtenant income the company estimates the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs is adjusted to income in the proper period owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value costs to reduce the carrying values of property equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with the companys policy on impairment of long lived assets inventory write downs if any in connection with store closings are classified in the consolidated statements of operations as merchandise costs

transition obligations that have not yet been recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost are required to be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci all plans are measured as of the companys fiscal year end the determination of the obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of assumptions used by actuaries and the company in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in note and include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets mortality and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company also participates in various multi employer plans for

current or noncurrent asset or liability based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes a deferred tax asset or liability that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting is classified according to the expected reversal date a notes to consolidated financial statements continued uncertain tax positions the company reviews the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in its consolidated financial statements refer to note for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions various taxing authorities periodically audit the companys income tax returns these audits include questions regarding the companys tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions including state and local taxes the company records allowances for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which an allowance has been established is audited and fully resolved as of january the internal revenue service had concluded its examination of the companys and federal tax returns tax years through remain under examination the assessment of the companys tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the companys various filing positions self insurance costs the company is primarily self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis the company is insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits the following table summarizes the changes in the companys self insurance liability through january beginning balance expense claim payments assumed from harris teeter ending balance less current portion long term portion the current portion of the self insured liability is included in other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the company maintains surety bonds related to self insured workers compensation claims these bonds are required by most states in which the company is self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of the companys obligations in the event the company is unable to meet its claim payment obligations up to its self insured retention levels these bonds do not represent liabilities of the company as the company has recorded reserves for the claim costs the company is similarly self insured for property related losses the company maintains stop loss coverage to limit its property loss exposures including coverage for earthquake wind flood and other catastrophic events revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale discounts provided to customers by the company at the time of sale including those provided in connection with loyalty cards are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold discounts provided by vendors usually in the form of paper a notes to consolidated financial statements continued coupons are not recognized as a reduction in sales provided the coupons are redeemable at any retailer that accepts coupons the company records a receivable from the vendor for the difference in sales price and cash received pharmacy sales are recorded when product is provided to the customer sales taxes are recorded as other accrued liabilities and not as a component of sales the company does not recognize a sale when it sells its own gift cards and gift certificates rather it records a deferred liability equal to the amount received a sale is then recognized when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed to purchase the companys products gift card and certificate breakage is recognized when redemption is deemed remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card the amount of breakage has not been material for and merchandise costs the merchandise costs line item of

managerial and administrative costs rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense are shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages transportation direct wages repairs and maintenance utilities inbound freight and where applicable third party warehouse management fees these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred the company believes the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout the industry the companys approach is to include in the merchandise costs line item the direct net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in its stores the company believes this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold the company recognizes all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold when possible vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item when the items are sold the vendor allowance is recognized when it is not possible due to systems constraints to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and therefore recognized as the product is sold advertising costs the companys advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred and are included in the merchandise costs line item of the consolidated statements of operations the companys pre tax advertising costs totaled in in and in the company does not record vendor allowances for co operative advertising as a reduction of advertising expense

the qualified plans funding for the company sponsored pension plans is based on a review of the specific requirements and on evaluation of the assets and liabilities of each plan in addition to

intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled they take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the companys policy is to match the plans cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plans projected benefit cash flows the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits respectively represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february by approximately to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets held by the company for the company considered current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories in the company decreased the assumed pension plan investment return rate to compared to in and the company pension plans average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december net of all investment management fees and expenses the value of all investments in the qualified plans during the calendar year ending december increased net of investment management fees and expenses for the past years the companys average annual rate of return has been based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with the companys target allocations the company believes a rate of return assumption is reasonable the company calculates its expected return on plan assets by using the market related value of plan assets the market related value of plan assets is determined by adjusting the actual fair value of plan assets for gains or losses on plan assets gains or losses represent the difference between actual and expected returns on plan investments for each plan year gains or losses on plan assets are recognized evenly over a five year period using a different method to calculate the market related value of plan assets would provide a different expected return on plan assets on january the company adopted new mortality tables based on mortality experience and assumptions for generational mortality improvement in calculating the companys year end company sponsored benefit plans obligations the tables assume an improvement in life expectancy and increase our current year benefit obligation and future expenses the company used the rp projected mortality table in calculating the companys year end company sponsored benefit plans

investment objectives and guidelines specifically applicable to each manager of assets are established and reviewed annually derivative instruments may be used for specified purposes including rebalancing exposures to certain asset classes any use of derivative instruments for a purpose or in a manner not specifically authorized is prohibited unless approved in advance by the committees the current target allocations shown represent the targets that were established in the company will rebalance by liquidating assets whose allocation materially exceeds target if possible and investing in assets whose allocation is materially below target if markets are illiquid the company may not be able to rebalance to target quickly to maintain actual asset allocations consistent with target allocations a notes to consolidated financial statements continued assets are reallocated or rebalanced periodically in addition cash flow from employer contributions and participant benefit payments can be used to fund underweight asset classes and divest overweight asset classes as appropriate the company expects that cash flow will be sufficient to meet most rebalancing needs the company is not required and does not expect to make any contributions to the qualified plans in if the company does make any contributions in the company expects these contributions will decrease its required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any contributions the company expects expense for company sponsored pension plans to be approximately in addition the company expects k retirement savings account plans cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to be approximately in assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
