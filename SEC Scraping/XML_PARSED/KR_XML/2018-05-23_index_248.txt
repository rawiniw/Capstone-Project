a growing number of corporations are sourcing their own renewable energy of those companies have committed to move toward renewable energy sourcing through the re initiative in contrast to its peers kroger continues to make little forward progress in renewable energy adoption this shareholder resolution requests that kroger evaluate adoption of enterprise wide renewable energy targets to reduce its carbon risk rationale for a yes vote kroger fails to disclose information allowing shareholders to assess how or whether the company is adequately addressing carbon risk or developing a renewable energy portfolio into the future kroger does not currently report any climate related targets beyond the companys target setting as found in cdp reports remains confusing and unclear providing data with moving baselines and targets that while appearing to be significant actually encompass relatively small improvements while any reduction effort by the company is laudable the companys energy reduction goal for announced in relies on a now year old baseline therefore this goal as announced will result in a reduction of the companys energy use by in total between and an anemic a year furthermore in recent years the company has reported increasing greenhouse gas emission putting into question if the company will even reach its minimal early targets between now and similarly krogers goal of improving transportation fuel efficiency by is little different from business as usual given current fuel economy standards krogers improvement goal tracks federal emissions requirements that require a increase in fuel efficiency of heavy vehicles by krogers fuel efficiency goal appears to simply track the companys vehicle replacement schedule finally the companys reporting on renewable energy describes individual sporadic renewable energy projects it has implemented but does not provide a cohesive enterprise wide renewable energy adoption program or goal kroger also notes its use of

adopting a renewable energy target is an important first step in assuring investors that our company is working to effectively remedy its climate risk climate change poses risks to kroger that remain insufficiently addressed increasing renewable energy adoption will reduce those risks and benefit the company unlike many companies today krogers annual report does not mention climate change climate risk or consider the risks related to its energy sourcing in contrast competitive retailers like walmart target and costco have recognized the material costs and risks of climate change to their businesses as an example target has responded by setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal through the science based targets initiative proactively managing carbon risk generally yields improved financial performance according to research from cdp when corporations track manage and reduce carbon impacts various financial indicators tend to improve including improved return on equity

power price certainty responsiveness to customer demand for low carbon solutions reduced overhead and reduced regulatory uncertainty from climate change regulations likely to impact operations and or future fossil fuel energy costs it comes as no surprise that major brands including whole foods gm coca cola walmart nestle nike johnson johnson and starbucks have made commitments toward renewable

diversify their power supply hedge against fuel risks and support innovation in an increasingly cost competitive way kroger which generates large carbon emissions significantly trails its peers on reducing climate impacts and renewable energy adoption although kroger has historically made commendable energy efficiency improvements toward meeting a energy consumption reduction goal by off a

emissions by increasing investments in renewables and efficiency despite growing its retail square footage by kroger fares comparably poorly its scope emissions increased from to due to reasons including increased sales and acquisitions as well as the temperature increasing in the areas where kroger stores are located with regard to renewable energy kroger falls further behind its peers for instance walmart has made a commitment to source of its power from renewables joining over other companies including whole foods market unilever coca cola and kelloggs kroger has made no such commitment and as of spring has only introduced solar power at seven of its thousands of stores plants and distribution centers and installed just two wind turbines this is especially minimal compared to target which by had installed solar on of its stores corporate procurement of renewable energy is accelerating quickly as the cost of renewable energy has dropped significantly nationally according to eia data the average cost of electricity from the grid was kwh for commercial customers in up from in renewable energy costs in contrast are lower and on a downward trajectory according to bloomberg new energy finance s sustainable energy in america factbook the most competitive power purchase agreements ppas came in at just over mwh for solar kwh while wind ppas executed in the u s

califa farms danone diageo kellogg s mars nestl organic valley pg starbucks and unilever are all re signatories many other major suppliers have set more modest renewable energy targets and more still are in the process of setting targets by failing to conduct the study requested by shareholders to determine the feasibility of setting a renewable energy target krogers management is missing a potentially major business opportunity this refusal also puts the company at risk of falling behind competitors that are able to procure renewable energy at lower costs and exposes the company to reputational and business risks posed by climate change response to the board of directors statement of opposition while kroger claims to be committed to sustainability our company has not disclosed a clear comprehensive forward looking strategy to address climate risks or increase renewable energy beyond a commitment to reduce energy use by per year for the next two years and increase fuel economy at rates equivalent to current federal requirements krogers existing commitments do not sufficiently indicate how the company will mitigate the potential for being left behind peers who are proactively setting renewable energy targets and taking responsibility for the critical greenhouse gas emission reductions required to limit global temperature increase to well below degrees celsiusthe internationally recognized goal intended to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change conclusion the requested report will provide an important first step in analyzing the value of adopting greater renewable energy resources to reduce climate risk and add to the companys resiliency and competitiveness krogers weak actions to reduce the companys total greenhouse gas emissions and its absolute increases in ghg emissions suggests a failure to recognize the serious risks this underperformance poses to its reputation brand regulatory compliance costs supply chain success and ongoing competitiveness with more efficient environmentally conscious peers with supply chains that stretch across the globe krogers operations are extremely vulnerable to the risks of climate change
