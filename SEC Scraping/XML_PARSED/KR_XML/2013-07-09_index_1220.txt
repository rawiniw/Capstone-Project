while continuing to operate and grow the harris teeter brands together we can continue to deepen our connections with customers across all of our markets this transaction is compelling for kroger from a financial and strategic standpoint it is also consistent with our growth strategy to enter new markets and fill in our existing markets we expect the addition of harris teeter will accelerate our growth into attractive new markets and enhance both our top and bottom line merger criteria kroger has a long history of successfully integrating with merger partners sharing the best of what each company has to offer while maintaining and enhancing the distinctive retail brands that has made each great we did this during the merger with dillons in and when we merged with fred meyer in not to

their markets stores that provide customers with the shopping experience they want an approach that is aligned with our customer st strategy a strong management team many of whom we expect to rely upon to continue to run harris teeter an entry into attractive contiguous markets where the combined infrastructures can be leveraged strong presence in many markets and a great base of stores to build on and most importantly a team of friendly and professional people who are devoted to exceptional customer service learning from each other and combining each companys strengths has been the cornerstone of success in the mergers we have done over the years we look forward to the same success with harris teeter harris teeter operational overview now ill discuss harris teeters operations in more detail and how we think about their markets and customers harris teeter operates stores in eight states primarily in the southeastern and mid atlantic united states and the district of columbia harris teeter is headquartered in matthews nc in addition to its retail stores harris teeter operates distribution centers for grocery frozen and perishable foods in greensboro nc and indian trail nc and a dairy facility in high point nc the company employs about associates and had net sales of billion in its last fiscal year which ended october looking more closely at their footprint and ours you will see they have stores in many attractive high growth markets for example of its stores harris teeter today operates stores in north carolina including in the charlotte area stores in south carolina including three in the charlotte area stores in the washington d c area which is the nations thlargest market four in the baltimore maryland market three in delaware as well as one store each in florida and georgia we will have minor overlap in raleigh nc charlottesville and hampton roads va and nashville tn we are making plans now as to how we will operate in each of these markets over the long term we are excited about entering new markets which include vibrant and growing major urban centers such as charlotte and washington d c several other metropolitan areas in the carolinas and affluent vacation destinations and university communities harris teeter operates in several markets with populations growing faster than the national average complementary core competencies we see a lot of opportunity to learn from one another and many ways that our combination will benefit each organization we plan to bring to harris teeter the things that kroger does very well including our purchasing power information systems and loyalty programs with the world class customer insights firm dunnhumbyusa this merger extends krogers footprint into new growing markets we also believe the entire kroger organization will benefit from harris teeters expertise in operating urban upscale stores and gain insights behind their strong customer ratings on people products and shopping experience interestingly they operate an online click and collect system and we expect to gain insight from harris teeter as we continue to study and test this online strategy integration planning upon receiving regulatory approval we will have teams from both organizations developing work plans to bring out the best of both companies we take integration very seriously and will work hard to capture all the benefits of a transaction for kroger harris teeter our shareholders customers and associates our disciplined and successful merger history is based on joining with companies with an established respected brand in their markets harris teeters brand is exceptional kroger strives to be a locally relevant retailer and we believe this is one of harris teeters many strengths following closing harris teeter will continue to operate its stores as a subsidiary of the kroger co and will continue to be led by key members of harris teeters senior management team i know that many associates for both companies want to know the plans for their markets while there are operational questions that are still to be answered in the coming months we see harris teeter as a strong merchant and expect to grow their franchise just as we expect to continue to grow krogers franchise we have no plans to close stores and associates will continue to have employment opportunities with both companies we will examine everything in the context of the companys growth when the transaction closes we will be in a position to share more about our plans for now i can say that we would like to keep everything about harris teeter that made the company the highly successful supermarket operator it is financial overview finally i will outline the financial elements of the proposed merger capital structure we will finance the deal with debt kroger also intends to assume harris teeters outstanding debt of approximately million we expect to access the capital markets in the next few weeks to refinance the bonds that matured earlier this year and then closer to closing issue debt at different maturities to finance the merger this will allow us to set up our capital structure to have exposure at various points along the yield curve and balance our fixed and floating rate exposure we have a bridge loan commitment in place to provide us the liquidity to fund the transaction both kroger and harris teeter have strong track records of returning cash to shareholders consistent with this shared long term commitment kroger intends to continue its quarterly dividend and share repurchase program while managing free cash flow to reduce the leverage taken on from this merger although the ratio will increase at the time the merger closes kroger expects to allocate some free cash flow to debt reduction to re establish and maintain its net debt to ebitda ratio over the next months the company is committed to maintaining its current investment grade credit rating accretion and synergies including the effect of allocating some free cash flow to debt reduction we expect net accretion to earnings per diluted share in the range of in the first full year after the merger excluding transition and transaction expenses kroger expects to maintain its current long term net earnings per share growth rate off of this higher earnings base we expect to achieve a total run rate of approximately to million in annual cost synergies over the next three to four years much of the savings is expected to come from the benefits of krogers scale kroger has a strong history of achieving synergy goals by us being patient in achieving those goals reduces the risk of the transaction and sets the stage for sustainable growth the merger is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval the transaction also is subject to a harris teeter shareholder vote which will require approval from a majority of the outstanding shares conclusion as you can see this transaction is compelling for kroger from a financial and strategic standpoint one that will accelerate our growth into attractive new markets and enhance our top and bottom line this is a unique opportunity and we look forward to get started working together i am now happy to take your questions forward looking statements these prepared remarks contain certain forward looking statements about the future performance of the company these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available to it these statements are indicated by words such as expects will plans intends committed to and is our ability to achieve earnings per share growth rate expectations may be affected by labor disputes particularly as the company seeks to manage
