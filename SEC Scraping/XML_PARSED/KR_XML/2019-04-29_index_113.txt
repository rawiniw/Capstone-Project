board leadership structure and lead independent director the board is currently composed of eleven independent non employee directors and one management director mr mcmullen the chairman and ceo kroger has a governance structure in which independent directors exercise meaningful and vigorous oversight as provided in krogers guidelines on issues of corporate governance the guidelines the board has designated one of the independent directors as lead director the lead director works with the chairman to share governance responsibilities facilitate the development of krogers strategy and grow shareholder value the lead director serves a variety of roles consistent with current best practices including reviewing and approving board meeting agendas materials and schedules to confirm that the appropriate topics are reviewed with sufficient information provided to directors on each topic and appropriate time is allocated to each serving as the principal liaison between the chairman management and the independent directors presiding at the executive sessions of independent directors and at all other meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present calling meetings of independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication following a request with major shareholders the lead director carries out these responsibilities in numerous ways including facilitating communication and collegiality among the board soliciting direct feedback from non employee directors overseeing the succession planning process including meeting with a wide range of employees including corporate and division management associates meeting with the ceo frequently to discuss strategy serving as a sounding board and

shareholders for the roles to be combined the board exercises this judgment as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances upon retirement of our former chairman david b dillon on december the board determined that it is in the best interests of kroger and our shareholders for one person to serve as the chairman and ceo as was the case from through with another individual serving as independent lead director the board believes that this leadership structure improves the boards ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps the company operate in the long term interest of shareholders additionally this structure provides an effective balance between strong company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent directors the board believes that the structure of the chairman and independent lead director position should continue to be considered as part of the succession planning process annual board evaluation process the board and each of its committees conduct an annual evaluation to determine whether the board is functioning effectively both at the board and at the committee levels as part of this annual evaluation the board assesses whether the current leadership structure and function continues to be appropriate for kroger and its shareholders the guidelines provide the flexibility for the board to modify our leadership structure in the future as appropriate we believe that kroger like many u s companies is well served by this flexible leadership structure the board recognizes that a robust evaluation process is an essential component of strong corporate governance practices and ensuring board effectiveness the corporate governance committee oversees an annual evaluation process led by the lead independent director who also serves as chair of the corporate governance committee each director completes a detailed written annual evaluation of the board and the committees on which he or she

recruitment of director candidates the guidelines on issues of corporate governance includes a policy that a directors normal retirement occurs at the annual meeting of shareholders following the year in which the director reaches the age of however the board believes that it is important to monitor the boards composition skills diversity and needs in the context of the companys overall strategy and therefore may elect to waive the policy in circumstances it deems necessary two directors will have reached their normal retirement date at the annual meeting jorge p montoya and james a runde upon review of the matter the corporate governance committee recommended and the board approved waiving the retirement date for mr montoya and mr runde and nominating these directors for re election at the annual meeting for an additional one year term the corporate governance committee and the board believe that mr montoyas and mr rundes experience as directors and their knowledge of the companys business and strategy particularly in light of the transition of the grocery industry will continue to be of value to the board also in light of mr beyer a long tenured director retiring from

committee kroger on managements recommendation retained korn ferry to provide other services for kroger in fiscal for which kroger paid these other services primarily related to consulting on administrative management and digital and technology compensation structure redesign the compensation committee expressly approved korn ferry performing these additional services after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the compensation committee determined that korn ferry was independent and their work has not raised any conflict of interest the compensation committee may engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable compensation committee interlocks and insider participation no member of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of kroger during fiscal and no member of the compensation committee is a former officer of kroger or was a party to any related person transaction involving kroger required to be disclosed under item of regulation s k during fiscal none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers serving as a member of krogers board of directors or compensation committee of the board board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board is responsible for strategic planning and overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo addresses matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees at the committee level reports are given by management subject matter experts to each committee on risks within the scope of their charters the audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control the major areas of risk exposure including cybersecurity risk the audit committee incorporates its risk oversight function into its regular reports to the board and also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective board committees regarding management of the risks they oversee for example our vice president chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates to the audit committee on our compliance risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk and our executive vice president and chief information officer and our chief information security officer provide regular updates on our cybersecurity risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk to the audit committee the audit committee reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by the lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr mcmullen as chairman and ceo in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and

announced restock kroger our plan to redefine the food and grocery customer experience in america and to create value for our shareholders we developed the plan because though we are proud of our long history of success and our strengths we recognize that what got us here will not get us where we want to be in the future restock kroger has four main drivers redefine the food and grocery customer experience focus on data and personalization digital space optimization our brands and smart pricing expand partnerships to create customer value focus on front end transformation technology innovation cost reduction and alternative profit streams develop talent accelerate high performance leadership culture through future talent development training and a rebalancing of pay and benefits live krogers purpose meet zero hunger zero waste targets and achieve sustainability goals the three year restock kroger plan is fueled by capital investments cost savings and restock cash flow as a result of our plan over the three year time period we expect to generate million in incremental fifo operating profit and billion of restock cash flow before dividends we have prioritized our estimated billion in capital investments to support restock kroger over the three year time period we are looking first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities across both brick and mortar and digital platforms followed by investments in logistics and technology platforms and finally capital for storing activity our compensation committee is focused on pay for performance the compensation committee has long maintained a strong pay for performance philosophy compensation must align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders and must create incentives to achieve the annual business plan targets and longer term company objectives we implemented a long term performance based bonus program available to kroger executives at the level of vice president and above more than ten years ago and the metrics were tailored to our long term measures at that time as our business objectives have shifted the compensation committee is focused on ensuring performance metrics are aligned with our long term strategy our long term compensation program align with restock kroger we made new commitments to shareholders on a three year time horizon under restock kroger we believe that the success of restock kroger depends on the focused attention of our leadership team and associates on the goals of restock kroger and that it is essential to implement new performance metrics that mirror these new commitments accordingly in we made changes to our program to align with restock kroger our three year long term plan has performance metrics tied entirely to restock kroger goals restock cash flow and cost savings included in fifo operating profit growth with a return on invested capital modifier we implemented a metric based on the cost savings imbedded in the achievement of operating profit growth because cost savings is essential to fund the strategic projects that will produce the operating profit growth we believe it is a more meaningful metric than operating profit growth itself because it forces us to focus on the savings that we need to support sustainable incremental operating profit growth since we grant a new three year long term incentive plan each year at any one time there are three outstanding plans because the and long term plans were mid cycle we felt strongly that we should focus on restock kroger metrics rather than having competing priorities as a result in setting restock cash flow is an adjusted free cash flow measure calculated as net cash provided by operating activities minus net cash used by investing activities plus or minus adjustments for certain items for important risk uncertainties and other factors relating to these forward looking statements see the risk factors in our annual report on form k that accompanies this proxy statement compensation the compensation committee determined that the metrics of the two mid cycle plans should be modified to align with restock kroger and the payouts for the then current neos should be addressed as described below for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year and performance was measured on the pre existing plan metrics and was applied to two thirds of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts fiscal year performance was measured on the restock kroger metrics of restock cash flow and savings included in fifo operating profit growth and was applied to one third of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts similarly for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year performance will be measured on the pre existing plan metrics and will be applied to one third of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts fiscal year and performance will be measured on the restock kroger metrics of restock cash flow and cost savings included in fifo operating profit growth and will be applied to two thirds of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts with respect to the mid cycle plans for the then current neos we did not adjust the cash bonus potentials or re issue previously issued performance unit grants we did not allow the re earning of cash and performance units that were not earned in the completed year s of the outstanding plans and we did not change the timing of the payout under the outstanding plans mr clark who was not a named executive officer at the time the plan was modified was eligible for a different plan as described below these plan updates are illustrated below our annual cash bonus program based on meeting financial goals we also redesigned the performance based annual cash bonus plan to better align with our financial goals of restock kroger and to simplify the way we reward our associates the annual plan had the following metrics id supermarket sales earnings per share kroger way plans strategic business plans that support restock kroger to further support the cost saving focus of restock kroger for any payout under the kroger way plans metric the company must have met its cost savings goals for our compensation philosophy and objectives as one of the largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent as well as motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals krogers incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation the compensation committee believes that there is a strong link between our business strategy the performance metrics in our short term and long term incentive programs and the business results that drive shareholder value we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our core purpose to feed the human spirit to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an neos level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of neos and shareholders components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the compensation committee has three related objectives regarding compensation first the compensation committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those individuals who are best suited to be an officer at kroger second a majority of compensation should help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the neos to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our neos is comprised of the following annual compensation salary performance based annual cash bonus long term compensation performance based long term incentive plan consisting of a long term cash bonus and performance units non qualified stock options restricted stock retirement and other benefits limited perquisites the annual and long term performance based compensation awards described herein were made pursuant to our long term incentive and cash bonus plan which was approved by our shareholders in annual compensation salary our philosophy with respect to salary is to provide a sufficient and stable source of fixed cash compensation all of our compensation cannot be at risk or long term it is important to provide a meaningful annual salary to attract and retain a high caliber leadership team and to have an appropriate level of cash compensation that is not variable salaries for the neos with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the compensation committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by all of the independent directors salaries for the neos were reviewed in june of the amount of each neos salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the compensation committee or in the case of the ceo of the compensation committee and the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure in role and relationship to other kroger executives salaries the assessment of individual contribution is a qualitative determination based on the following factors leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the neo increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values annual compensation performance based annual cash bonus the neos participate in a performance based annual cash bonus plan the amount of annual cash bonus that the neos earn each year is based upon krogers performance compared to goals established by the compensation committee and the independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors a minimum level of performance must be achieved before any payouts are earned while a payout of up to of target bonus potential can be achieved for superior performance there are no guaranteed or minimum payouts if none of the performance goals are achieved then none of the bonus is earned and no payout is made the annual cash bonus plan is designed to encourage decisions and behavior that drive the annual operating results and the long term success of the company krogers success is based on a combination of factors and accordingly the compensation committee believes that it is important to encourage behavior that supports multiple elements of our business strategy establishing annual cash bonus potentials the compensation committee establishes annual cash bonus potentials for each neo other than the ceo whose annual cash bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the goals established by the compensation committee actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the goals established by the compensation committee or as high as of the potential bonus amount if the performance far exceeds these pre established goals the compensation committee considers multiple factors in making its determination or recommendation as to annual cash bonus potentials the individuals level within the organization as the compensation committee believes that more senior executives should have a more substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance the individuals salary as the compensation committee believes that a significant portion of a neos total cash compensation should be dependent upon krogers performance the individuals level in the organization and the internal relationship of annual cash bonus potentials within kroger individual performance the recommendation of the ceo for the other neos and the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding annual cash bonus potential and total compensation awarded by our peer group annual cash bonus plan metrics the annual cash bonus plan is a broad based plan used across the kroger enterprise approximately associates receive bonus payouts based all or in part on the bonus plan described below the annual cash bonus plan had the following measurable performance metrics all of which are interconnected metric weight rationale for use id supermarket sales combined based on a grid id supermarket sales represent sales without fuel at our supermarkets that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our supermarket sales across the enterprise a key driver of our model is strong id supermarket sales it is the engine that fuels our growth earnings per share in previous years we used net operating profit as a performance metric as it allowed us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we cannot achieve solid net operating profit without a strong operating model during the first year of restock kroger our business plan anticipated a reduction in net operating profit so we substituted earnings per share for the annual bonus plan to better motivate our associates across the enterprise to increase this measure of earnings growth as earnings per share were expected to grow in kroger way plans each major business line and department created a kroger way plan a strategic business plan to directly support one of the four pillars of restock kroger each proprietary kroger way plan outlines both the resource allocation and the return commitment for that plan combined these plans form the basis for achieving the three year restock kroger commitments because cost savings is foundational to the success of restock kroger no payout can be earned under the kroger way plan metric without the company achieving cost savings of million regardless of the extent of the progress on the kroger way plans total of metrics results of annual cash bonus plan the goals established by the compensation committee the actual results and the bonus percentage earned for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as follows payout matrix id supermarket sales id sales and eps for fiscal year eps performance metrics result payout percentage a weight b amount earned a x b id sales eps id sales eps kroger way plans total earned see grid above the company achieved cost savings of billion which is an amount in excess of the savings threshold of million because the threshold was achieved it was possible to earn a payout on this metric the kroger way plan measures were approved by the compensation committee but are not disclosed as they are competitively sensitive following the close of the year the compensation committee reviewed krogers performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives due to our performance when compared to the goals established by the compensation committee the payout on the annual bonus was of the participants bonus potential in as in all years the compensation committee retained discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus payout for all executive officers including the neos if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate given their assessment of company performance however no adjustments were made in that affected neo bonuses the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus the compensation committee and the independent directors also retained discretion to adjust the goals for each metric under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year the actual annual cash bonus percentage payout for reflects strong performance on adjusted earnings per share and performance below business plan objectives on identical supermarket sales the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of earned amounts under our annual cash bonus plan in previous years such as and when payouts were particularly low in those years we failed to achieve many of our business plan objectives a comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage payouts this year and in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance fiscal year annual cash bonus payout percentage as described above the annual cash bonus payout percentage is applied to each neos bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo the actual amounts of performance based annual cash bonuses paid to the neos for are reported in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the neos to achieve the long term goals established by the board as such a majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the companys long term goals and is delivered via four long term compensation vehicles long term cash bonus performance units stock options and restricted stock long term compensation promotes long term value creation and discourages the over emphasis of attaining short term goals at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee considers several factors in determining the target value of long term compensation awarded to the neos or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include individual performance the neos level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation awards within kroger the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding long term compensation awarded by our peer group and the recommendation of the ceo for the other neos long term incentives are structured to be a combination of performance and time based compensation that reflects elements of financial and common shares performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit payouts are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial measures and incentivize recipients to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the companys long term strategic goals stock options and restricted stock are linked to common shares performance creating alignment between the neos and our shareholders interests options have no initial value and recipients only realize benefits if the value of our common shares increases following the date of grant a majority of long term compensation is equity based performance units stock options and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common shares further aligning the interests of our neos with our shareholders all four components of long term compensation are intended to focus executive behaviors on our long term strategy each component is described in more detail below amounts of long term compensation awards issued and outstanding for the neos are set forth in the executive compensation tables section long term incentive plan design in recent years we have adopted a new long term incentive plan each year which provides for overlapping three year performance periods the long term incentive plans adopted in and which consist of a performance based long term cash bonus and performance units have the following characteristics the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the participants salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition a fixed number of performance units based on level and individual performance is awarded to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the earned awards are paid out in kroger common shares based on actual performance along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares ultimately earned the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance units earned are each determined based on our performance against the metrics established by the compensation committee the independent directors for the ceo at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the baseline of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance units awarded the compensation committee anticipates adopting a new long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year periods and long term incentive plan metrics the following table summarizes the metrics applied to fiscal years and and the payout percentages metric rationale for use customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer this proprietary metric measures the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of people products shopping experience and price payout per unit of improvement improvement in associate engagement kroger measures associate engagement in an annual survey of associates payout per unit of improvement reduction in operating costs as a percentage of sales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way payout per reduction in operating costs roic part of our long term growth strategy is to make substantial capital investments over time this measure is intended to hold executives accountable for the returns on the capital investments payout per improvement in roic operating costs is a non gaap measure and is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel operating costs will exclude one time expenses incurred in lieu of future anticipated obligations future expenses that are avoided by virtue of the incurrence of the one time expense will be deemed to be total operating costs in the year in which they otherwise would have been incurred return on invested capital is a non gaap measure and is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our last in first out lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital will be calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities excluding accrued income taxes as described above under realignment of performance based pay to restock kroger for and beyond the metrics listed above for the and plans will be used to measure performance through and will be applied to the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus targets on a prorated basis performance for and will be measured on the restock kroger metrics of free cash flow and cost savings included in fifo operating profit growth and will also be applied to bonus targets on a prorated basis results of long term incentive plan the long term incentive plan which measured performance over the three year period from to paid out in march the plan was modified during as described above with respect to the then current named executive officers and was calculated in two parts as follows part fiscal year and performance was measured on the existing plan metrics and was applied to two thirds of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts metric baseline result improvement a payout per improvement b percentage earned a x b customer st strategy no improvement improvement in associate engagement no improvement reduction in

long term cash bonus payments in an amount equal to of that executives long term cash bonus potential and were issued the number of kroger common shares equal to of the number of performance units awarded to that executive along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid on that number of common shares during the three year performance period mr clark who was not a named executive officer at the time the plan was modified received a payment with respect to and performance and received a payout with respect to performance on the full amount of his bonus target the cash payout and dividends paid on common shares earned under the long term incentive plan are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation and all other compensation columns of the summary compensation

for its employees the neos participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code the code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding certain retirement benefits available to the neos can be found below in footnote to the summary compensation table and the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the neos participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year additional details regarding our nonqualified deferred compensation plans available to the neos can be found below in the nonqualified deferred compensation table and the accompanying narrative kroger also maintains the kroger co employee protection plan kepp which covers all of our management employees who are classified as exempt under the federal fair labor standards act and certain administrative or technical support personnel who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other benefits as described

described in the grant agreements none of the neos are party to an employment agreement perquisites our neos receive limited perquisites because the compensation committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide executives a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in some neos received premiums paid on life insurance policies further details on these benefits can be found in footnote to the summary compensation table process for establishing executive compensation the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of our executive officers including the neos with the exception of the ceo the compensation committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those members of the board establish the ceos compensation the compensation committee directly engaged korn ferry as a compensation consultant to advise the compensation committee in the design of compensation for executive officers through the compensation planning cycle korn ferry conducted an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the compensation committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the compensation committee determines compensation the consultant assessed base salary target performance based annual cash bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual cash bonus potential annualized long term compensation such as performance based long term cash bonus potential and performance units stock options and restricted stock and total direct compensation the sum of target annual cash compensation and annualized long term compensation in addition to the factors identified above the consultant also reviewed actual payout amounts against the targeted amounts the consultant compared these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded companies selected by the compensation committee for our peer group consisted of best buy home depot target cardinal health johnson johnson tjx companies costco wholesale lowes wal mart cvs health procter gamble walgreens boots alliance express scripts sysco the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant the compensation committee modified the peer group in because of industry consolidation and other competitive forces previously the compensation committee used a primary peer group consisting only of food and drug retailers in addition the compensation committee considered data from general industry companies provided by its independent compensation consultant a representation of major publicly traded companies of similar size and scope from outside the retail industry this data provided reference points particularly for senior executive positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector the modified peer group includes a combination of food and drug retailers other large retailers based on revenue size and large consumer facing companies median revenue for the peer group was billion compared to our revenue of billion considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the compensation committee believes that salaries paid to our neos should be competitively positioned relative to amounts paid by peer group companies for comparable positions the compensation committee also aims to provide an annual cash bonus potential to our neos that if achieved at superior levels would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the baselines established by the compensation committee the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos compensation in setting total compensation the independent directors consider the median compensation of the peer groups ceos with respect to the annual bonus the independent directors make two determinations they determine the annual cash bonus potential that will be multiplied by the annual cash bonus payout percentage earned that is applicable to the neos and the independent directors determine the annual cash bonus amount paid to the ceo by retaining discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive under the formulaic plan the compensation committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other neos in its annual review of compensation for the neos the compensation committee conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the neos on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each neo of salary performance based annual cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation stock options restricted stock accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits company paid health and welfare benefits banked vacation severance benefits available under kepp and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the compensation committee has determined that the compensation of the ceo and that of the other neos bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the compensation committees compensation consultant reflecting a comprehensive review of each element of pay mix both annual and long term and comparing neo and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies including both our peer group of competitors and a larger general industry group to ensure that the compensation committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary annual cash bonus potential and long term compensation awards for each of the senior officers including the other neos the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the compensation committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team the compensation committee does not make use of a formula but both qualitatively and quantitatively considers each of the factors identified above in setting compensation shareholder engagement the advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting we held our eighth annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote in in we also requested meetings with shareholders representing nearly of our outstanding shares during the proxy season and off season engagement and ultimately engaged with shareholders representing over a third of our outstanding shares conversations with our shareholders in these meetings included discussions of our compensation program with our shareholders providing feedback that they appreciate the pay for performance nature of our programs structure in light of this feedback and the strong support for our executive compensation program at the annual meeting the compensation committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs for stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our officers and directors with your interests as shareholders the board has adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines require non employee directors executive officers and other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger common shares as set forth below position multiple chief executive officer times base salary president and chief operating officer times base salary executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents times base salary group vice presidents division presidents and other designated key executives times base salary non employee directors times annual base cash retainer all covered individuals are expected to achieve the target level within five years of appointment to their positions until the requirements are met covered individuals

necessary to pay the exercise price of the options and or applicable taxes and must retain all kroger common shares unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo executive compensation recoupment policy clawback if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual cash bonus or a long term cash bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the compensation committee then the officer upon demand from the compensation committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the compensation committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment compensation policies as they relate to risk management as part of the compensation committees review of our compensation practices the compensation committee considers and analyzes the extent to which risks arise from such practices and their impact on krogers business as discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis our policies and practices for compensating employees are designed to among other things attract and retain high quality and engaged employees in this process the compensation committee also focuses on minimizing risk through the implementation of certain practices and policies such as the executive compensation recoupment policy which is described above under executive compensation recoupment policy clawback accordingly we do not believe that our compensation practices and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on kroger prohibition on hedging and pledging after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board adopted a policy prohibiting kroger directors and executive officers from engaging directly or indirectly in the pledging of hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities section m of the internal revenue code prior to the effective date of the tax cuts and jobs act of section m of the code generally disallowed a federal tax deduction to public companies for compensation greater than million paid in any tax year to specified executive officers unless the compensation was qualified performance based compensation under that section pursuant to the tax cuts and jobs act of the exception for qualified performance based compensation under section m of the code was eliminated with respect to all remuneration in excess of million other than qualified performance based compensation pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on november or earlier which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date the legislation providing for such transition rule the transition rule as a result performance based compensation that the compensation committee structured in previous years with the intent of qualifying as performance based compensation under section m that will be paid after january may not be fully deductible depending on the application of the transition rule the committee willconsistent with its past practicecontinue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long term interests of the company and our shareholders with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account compensation committee report the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with krogers management the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this proxy statement based on its review and discussions with management the compensation

compensation table for ceo pay ratio as required by section b of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and item u of regulation s k we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chairman and ceo mr mcmullen to the annual total compensation of our median employee as reported in the summary compensation table our ceo had annual total compensation for of using this summary compensation table methodology the annual total compensation of our median employee for was as a result we estimate that the ratio of our ceos annual total compensation to that of our median employee for fiscal was to this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with sec rules based on our payroll records and the methodology described below the sec rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employees annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices as such other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies exclusions estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios therefore the estimated pay ratio reported above may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies and should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies we identify the median employee from our employee population on the last day of our th fiscal period december which included full time part time temporary and seasonal employees who were employed on that date the consistently applied compensation measure we used was base salary wages paid which we measured from the beginning of our fiscal year february through february and we multiplied the average weekly earnings during this period of each full time and part time permanent employee by which was the number of weeks in fiscal we annualized the earnings of all permanent employees who were on a leave of absence or were new hires in we did not make any other adjustments permissible by the sec nor did we make any other material assumptions or estimates to identify our median employee the median employee did not change from the prior year there were no changes in our employee population or compensation arrangements that would have significantly affected our pay ratio calculation once the median employee was identified we then determined the median employees annual total compensation using the summary compensation table methodology as detailed in item c x of regulation s k and compared it to the annual total compensation of mr mcmullen as detailed in the total column of the summary compensation table for to arrive at the pay ratio disclosed above item no advisory vote to approve executive compensation you are being asked to vote on an advisory basis to approve the compensation of our neos the board of directors recommends that you vote for the approval of compensation of our neos the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in july requires that we give our shareholders the right to approve on a nonbinding advisory basis the compensation of our neos as disclosed earlier in this proxy statement in accordance with the secs rules as discussed earlier in the cda our compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent and to motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals our incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation to achieve our objectives we seek to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so we are guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of executives and shareholders and components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation rather the vote relates to the compensation of our neos as described in this proxy statement the vote is advisory this means that the vote is not binding on kroger the compensation committee of the board is responsible for establishing executive compensation in so doing the compensation committee will consider along with all other relevant factors the results of this vote we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution resolved that the compensation paid to the companys neos as disclosed pursuant to item of regulation s k including the compensation discussion and analysis compensation tables and the related narrative discussion is hereby approved the next advisory vote will occur at our annual meeting the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal item no vote to approve the kroger co long term incentive plan you are being asked to vote to approve the kroger long term incentive plan the plan our board of directors has adopted and recommends that you vote for this proposal under this item no the board is recommending that our shareholders approve the plan which was adopted subject to shareholder approval by the board of directors on april the plan is intended to replace our shareholder approved long term incentive and cash bonus plan as amended the plan and our shareholder approved long term incentive and cash bonus plan as amended the plan and to implement among other things authorization of new shares for issuance under the plan a mandated minimum vesting period of one year and a double trigger approach for change in control vesting if awards are not assumed substituted or otherwise replaced in connection with the change in control if the plan is approved by our shareholders it will become effective as of the date of the annual meeting and no additional awards will be granted under the plan or the plan in the event that our shareholders do not approve this proposal the plan will not become effective and the plan and plan will continue to be effective in accordance with their terms no awards have or will be made under the plan prior to its approval by shareholders at the annual meeting as described above in the section entitled compensation discussion and analysis beginning on page above the compensation committee of the board of directors has long maintained a strong pay for performance philosophy designed to attract and retain the best management talent to motivate employees to achieve our business and financial goals and to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation the compensation committee believes that there is a strong link between our business strategy the performance metrics in our short term and long term incentive programs and the business results that drive shareholder value to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an neos level of responsibility if the plan is approved the company will be able to continue to provide equity awards as part of its compensation program which is necessary to successfully attract and retain the best possible candidates for positions of substantial responsibility within the company and to ensure that compensation is competitive and has a direct link with performance moreover awarding equity compensation aligns the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders and creates incentives to achieve the annual business plan targets and longer term company objectives the details and design elements of the plan are set forth in the section entitled summary of the plan beginning on page below providing equity and equity based awards aligns employee compensation interests with the investment interests of our shareholders and reduces cash compensation expense permitting cash to be reinvested in our business or returned to our shareholders approval of the plan will allow kroger to continue to provide equity and equity based awards to recruit and compensate its officers and other key employees beyond the time at which the shares reserved under the plan and the plan would be depleted if the plan is not approved the company will continue to grant awards under the plan and the plan until there are no longer any shares available for grant we are requesting approval of shares for awards under the plan awards may also be made under the plan with respect to an estimated shares that as of april remain available for grant under the plan and the plan each of which has previously been approved by our shareholders in addition if and only to the extent forfeited in accordance with the terms of such plans a maximum of shares previously granted under the plan and the plan may become available for awards under the plan for the avoidance of doubt such shares are not initially available for grant under the plan we refer to the aggregate number of shares available for awards under the plan as the share reserve the share reserve will be reduced by one share for each share subject to a stock option or share appreciation right and by shares for each share subject to a restricted stock award award of restricted stock units including performance units or other share award in determining the number of shares to request under the plan we evaluated our share availability under the plan and the plan recent share usage our historical annual equity award grant rate our historical forfeiture rate and our estimates of the number of shares needed to attract new executive hires we expect that the share reserve will allow us to continue to appropriately grant equity awards at reasonable and desirable levels for approximately the next three years however the amount of future awards is not currently known and will depend on various factors that cannot be predicted including but not limited to the price of our shares on future grant dates the volatility of the stock and the types of awards that will be granted key plan provisions the plan has a ten year term the plan provides for the following types of equity awards stock options both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options share appreciation rights restricted stock awards restricted stock units including performance units cash incentive awards and share awards shares will be newly authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the plan an estimated shares that remain available for grant under the plan and the plan as of april may also be granted under the plan any shares subject to outstanding awards under the plan or plan that are forfeited cancelled or otherwise expire that would have been added back to the share reserves under the plan or plan will roll over into the share reserve of the plan subject to a maximum of shares that may be forfeited under such plans as described above the share reserve will be reduced by one share for each share subject to a stock option or share appreciation right and by shares for each share subject to a restricted stock award award of restricted stock units including performance units or other share award all types of equity awards granted under the plan may have all or a significant portion of compensation linked to the achievement of performance goals by the company and or the participant and the plan will be administered by the compensation committee which is comprised entirely of independent non employee directors and which may delegate authority to a committee of executives in respect of awards to kroger associates who are not our neos or subject to section under the exchange act in addition the plan increases flexibility for design of performance based awards following the repeal of the exemption for performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code of as amended section m the compensation committee aims to continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the long term best interests of kroger and our shareholders with deductibility of compensation being only one of a range of considerations taken into account key shareholder considerations shareholders should consider the following in determining whether to approve the plan our burn rate is reasonable as detailed in the table below our three year average adjusted burn rate which we define as the number of shares subject to time based equity awards granted and performance based equity awards earned in a fiscal year divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for that fiscal year with a multiplier as assigned by iss of for full value shares is it is our intention to remain within the burn rate guidelines established by iss for our industry fiscal year options granted full value shares granted total granted full value shares adjusted weighted average of common shares outstanding burn rate total granted options adjusted full value shares dilution dilution is commonly measured by overhang which generally refers to the amount of total potential dilution to current shareholders that could result from future issuance of the shares reserved under an equity compensation plan as of april shares were subject to outstanding equity awards under our plan and plan shares were subject to outstanding equity awards under our long term incentive and cash bonus plan as amended the plan and our long term incentive plan as amended the plan an additional shares were reserved for issuance under our plan and plan and for the avoidance of doubt no shares remain available for issuance under the plan and the plan and we are requesting an additional shares for grant under the plan which based on shares outstanding on april results in a total potential dilution of this overhang is reasonable compared to that of our peers clawbacks awards granted under the plan may be subject to recoupment in accordance with section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding recoupment of erroneously awarded compensation awards may also be subject to recoupment under the terms of the plan for a period of one year following after the settlement of an award under the plan or may be subject to krogers clawback policy as described on page above in the section entitled executive compensation recoupment policy clawback in the compensation discussion analysis the plan follows best market practices the plan has been designed consistent with the qualitative standards of proxy advisory firms and equity plan best practices as a result the plan provides that no award may vest prior to the one year anniversary of such awards date of grant other than vesting upon the death or disability of the participant or upon a change in control except that up to of the share reserve of the plan may be subject to awards that do not meet such minimum vesting requirement does not permit the repricing of awards granted under the plan unless approved by shareholders does not provide for automatic acceleration of vesting of equity awards upon a change in control of the company also known as a single trigger acceleration does not contain an annual evergreen provision and therefore shareholder approval is required to increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the plan contains a fungible share pool provision which limits shareholder dilution by charging the share reserve with shares for each share subject to a full value award provides that all stock options and share appreciation rights have an exercise price equal to at least the fair market value of our common shares on the date the stock option or share appreciation right is granted except in certain situations in which we are assuming options granted by another company that we are acquiring provides that i no dividends or dividend equivalent rights will be paid or provided with respect to awards other than restricted shares and share awards and ii dividend equivalents accrued with respect to awards of restricted stock units including performance units if any may not be paid before the date such awards have vested and does not provide for any tax gross ups summary of the plan

of the shares if an optionee satisfies such holding periods upon a sale of the shares the company will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes if an optionee disposes of shares within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the date of exercise a disqualifying disposition the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date and the option exercise price not to exceed the gain realized on the sale if the disposition is a transaction with respect to which a loss if sustained would be recognized will be taxed as ordinary income at the time of disposition any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain if a loss is recognized there will be no ordinary income and such loss will be a capital loss any ordinary income recognized by the optionee upon the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes except to the extent such

regulations to permit board amendments in accordance with ohio law under this item no we are asking our shareholders to approve an amendment to our regulations allowing the board of directors to adopt amendments to the regulations to the extent permitted by ohio law our regulations currently require our shareholders to adopt all amendments we also asked shareholders to approve this proposal at our annual meeting we received the overwhelming support of of our shareholders that voted on the proposal however the proposal requires the affirmative vote of of outstanding shares rather than of shares voted we received the support of of our outstanding shares falling just short of the necessary that must support the proposal for the proposal to pass because of the overwhelming support this year we are again requesting that our shareholders afford us the flexibility that many other ohio public companies have to more efficiently oversee the companys governance by giving our board the ability to amend our regulations in certain circumstances the text of the revised article vii of our regulations with the additional text proposed by the amendment indicated by underlining is set forth below the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the proposed text of the amendment below like many ohio companies that have also amended their regulations to permit amendments by their boards of directors we are asking our shareholders to approve item no in light of the following many jurisdictions such as delaware have historically allowed the directors of a corporation to amend the corporations bylaws the delaware equivalent of ohios regulations without shareholder approval since ohio law provides ohio corporations with flexibility similar to delaware corporations to make certain amendments to their regulations without shareholder approval if the authority is provided in the corporations articles of incorporation or regulations subject to statutory limitations that prohibit directors from amending the regulations in a way that affects important rights that ohio law reserves for shareholders giving this flexibility to our board of directors would enable them efficiently and cost effectively streamline and improve the regulations as needed in the future and also to quickly adapt them to changes in state law or governance trends such as adopting or amending proxy access provisions or adopting modern provisions regarding electronic notice and actions even if this item no is approved under ohio law only our shareholders would be able to make the following amendments to our regulations changing the percentage of common shares needed to call a special shareholders meeting changing the length of the time period required for notice of shareholders meetings changing the requirement for a quorum at shareholders meetings prohibiting shareholder or director actions from being authorized or taken without a meeting defining terms of office for directors or providing for classification of directors requiring greater than a majority vote of shareholders to remove directors without cause changing the requirements for a quorum at directors meetings or the required vote for an action of the directors or including a requirement that a control share acquisition of the corporation be approved by the corporations shareholders accordingly if shareholders approve item no article vii of our regulations would be revised to allow the board of directors to amend our regulations in the future to the extent permitted by ohio law which authority could not be delegated to a committee of the board of directors and and the board would be able to amend repeal and adopt new regulations to implement ministerial and other changes to our regulations other than with respect to the matters reserved for shareholders under ohio law including as set forth above without the time consuming and expensive process of seeking shareholder approval the amendment also clarifies that the power to amend the regulations whether exercised by the board or shareholders includes the power to adopt new regulations if item no is approved we would promptly notify shareholders of any amendments to our regulations made by the board of directors either by filing a report with the sec or by sending a notice to shareholders of record as of the date of the adoption of the amendment our shareholders would continue to be able to adopt amend and repeal the regulations without action by the board and therefore to change any amendment made by the board of directors should they determine that to be appropriate the actual text of the revised article vii of our regulations with changes indicated by underlining is set forth below the amendment would become effective at the time of the shareholder vote article vii amendment of regulations these regulations may be amended or repealed or new regulations may be adopted a at any meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose or without such meeting by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power on such proposal except that the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise of the voting power on such proposal shall be required to amend alter change or repeal sections or of article ii or this article vii or to amend alter change or repeal these regulations in any way inconsistent with the intent of the foregoing provisions or b by the board of directors to the extent permitted by the ohio revised code the board of directors recommends a vote for this proposal item no ratification of the appointment of krogers independent auditor you are being asked to ratify the appointment

recyclability of packaging we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas a portion of kroger house brand product packaging is unrecyclable including plastics which are a growing component of plastic pollution and marine litter authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life spreads toxics and poses a potential threat to human health the environmental cost of consumer plastic products and packaging exceeds billion annually according to the american chemistry council plastic is the fastest growing form of packaging u s flexible plastic sales are estimated at billion dried fruit frozen meat cheese and dog food are some of the kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches private label items account for a quarter of all sales nearly billion annually using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources william mcdonough a leading green design advisor calls pouch packaging a monstrous hybrid designed to end up either in a landfill or incinerator recyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious yet recycling rates stagnate only of plastic packaging is recycled according to the u s environmental protection agency epa billions of pouches and similar multi layer plastic laminates lie buried in landfills unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways an assessment of marine debris by the global environment facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled in the marine environment plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food studies by the epa suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent bio accumulative toxic chemicals plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets if no actions are taken oceans are expected to contain more plastic than fish by making all packaging recyclable if possible is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by plastic pollution better management of plastic could save consumer goods companies billion a year companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging other companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability kroger is lagging behind competitors our direct grocery competitors walmart and target have both agreed to make their packaging recyclable by colgate palmolive pepsico procter gamble and unilever have also developed packaging recyclability goals resolved shareowners of kroger request that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging supporting statement proponents believe that the report should include an assessment of the reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging and if possible goals and a timeline to phase out unrecyclable packaging the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger is committed to advancing sustainability in the area of packaging sustainability as part of our sustainability goals and our zero hunger zero waste social impact plan we agree that improving the recyclability of product packaging is needed to reduce the environmental impacts of plastic pollution our commitments a few years ago kroger introduced our sustainability goals which include several targets to optimize our brands product packaging these include improving the recyclability of plastic packaging and achieving recycled content in packaging for kroger manufactured products which also helps drive demand for recycled materials in addition we pledged to increase communication with our customers about recyclability and help expand recycling infrastructure because we can not solve this problem alone we committed to increase responsible fiber sourcing in paper packaging and finally we committed to reduce plastic in our brands packaging by million pounds by the end of we had achieved more than million pounds of reduced plastic in our manufactured plastic packaging since our baseline in large part thanks to converting more dairy plants to our lighter weight milk jug which is lighter than our previous jug we are in process of analyzing and calculating the recycled content and certified responsibly grown fiber proportion of our packaging footprint we continue to add please recycle to relevant packages and we are working across relevant business units and with input from our suppliers to evaluate meaningful opportunities to add and increase recycled content in our packaging as well as move to more recyclable packaging materials and designs and finally we offer our customers an in store recycling program through which they can drop plastic film packaging such as shopping bags bread and produce bags and bottled water case wraps in our store lobbies the detailed packaging optimization goals for and an update on our progress can be found at http sustainability kroger com goals html looking ahead as we approach we recognize the need to consider the next generation of packaging goals for kroger and we want to share our plans for that will inform this work we will track and share progress on krogers current packaging targets in our sustainability report to be published mid year conduct an analysis of our brands products to fully understand the current state of packaging recyclability across the portfolio these findings will help us identify key opportunity areas and set priorities for future packaging improvements kroger will share high level findings from this analysis in our sustainability report evaluate multi stakeholder initiatives focused on improving recycling accessibility and infrastructure and identify opportunities for kroger to participate and support join the how recycle product labeling program to support our recyclability assessment and improve communication with customers about how to recycle our brands packaging set a time bound target to increase recyclability of our brands packaging using findings from the analysis above and other benchmarking we believe our current packaging sustainability commitments as well as the additional steps we have outlined for address the primary objectives outlined in the shareholder proposal as a result we urge you to support these efforts and vote against this proposal item no shareholder proposal independent chairman we have been notified by several shareholders the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting resolved shareowners of the kroger co kroger ask the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent member of the board this policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation the policy should provide that i if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the policy within days of that determination and ii compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair supporting statement except for brief apprenticeship periods at the outset of their ceo service kroger ceos have also held the role of board chair for many decades we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporations governance which can harm shareholder value as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and support strong board oversight proxy advisor glass lewis opined in a report that shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a ceo or other executive also serves as chairman an independent board chair has been found in academic studies to improve the performance of public companies although evidence overall is inconclusive while separating the roles of chair and ceo is the norm in europe of sp company boards have also implemented this best practice we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly useful at kroger in providing more robust oversight regarding sustainability issues we agree with the recent observations by state street global advisors ceo that a long term horizon requires a focus on sustainability and that boards are often better equipped than the day to day management to see these issues over longer time horizons kroger continues to risk its reputation by selling produce treated with neonicotinoids a group of insecticides highly toxic to bees kroger has refused to join the fair food program to ensure equitable treatment of farm workers kroger also faces reputational risk associated with its responses to the impacts of food production on deforestation independent board leadership would we think more likely result in improved policies and practices to mitigate these business risks we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons the board believes it should have the ability to tailor its structure to krogers needs at any time and that krogers board is currently structured to provide the most effective leadership for our shareholders our shareholders interests are best served when the company retains the flexibility to select the appropriate person to serve in the chairmans role given the changing circumstances of the retail food marketplace not by adopting a rigid one size fits all approach kroger has a balanced governance structure in which independent directors including an independent lead director exercise meaningful and vigorous oversight the board recently appointed a new lead director bringing a fresh perspective to the role mr sargent previously served as chairman and ceo of staples and brings over years of retail experience and a deep understanding of retail operations consumer insights and e commerce to the board our strong independent lead director serves the same functions as a chairman and provides the safeguards that the proposal seeks krogers independent lead director has a robust set of responsibilities that ensure a strong independent and active board that complements the chairmans role which are addressed in detail in the guidelines available at ir kroger com the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving all board meeting agendas meeting materials and schedule serving as a liaison between the chairman and the independent directors presiding at the regularly conducted executive sessions of independent directors and meetings of the board when the chairman is not present calling an executive session of the independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication if requested by major shareholders while our current chairman is also the ceo this structure is a reflection of the boards current view that both kroger and our shareholders are best served by a combination of the roles at this time our ceos strong background in finance operations and strategic partnerships are particularly important to the board given krogers current transformation under the restock kroger plan his consistent leadership deep industry expertise and extensive knowledge of the company are also especially critical in the midst of the rapidly evolving retail landscape www glasslewis com wp content uploads in depth report independent board chairman pdf https www spencerstuart com media october ssbi pdf www ssga com investment topics environmental social governance long term value begins at the board eu pdf the board routinely reviews krogers leadership structure which includes a discussion of krogers performance the impact that the leadership has on that performance and the structure that best serves the interests of shareholders the board will continue to regularly review krogers leadership structure to ensure that the structure best addresses krogers evolving and dynamic business in consultation with our shareholders the board believes that retaining the flexibility to determine which type of leadership structure is most effective for krogers specific circumstances is critical for the long term success of our company our strong governance practices ensure our boards independent leadership and oversight the board has instituted structures and practices in addition to the independent lead director that create a balanced governance system of independent and effective oversight including all of krogers board members are independent except for the ceo all members including chairpersons of each of the board committees are independent the full board of independent directors annually evaluate the ceos performance led by the independent lead director the full board and each committee performs annual self assessments the board is committed to board refreshment and diversity and the board and each of its committees have unfettered access to management and the authority to retain independent advisors as they deem appropriate for
