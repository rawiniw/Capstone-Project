approximately per gallon as well as continued strong growth in gallons sold lifo million pension contributions expenses company sponsored pension plans we expect expense to be approximately million although we are not required to make a contribution we expect to contribute approximately million during k plan for we expect a slight increase in our cash contributions and expense compared to multi employer plans in we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension funds we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years but we believe it unlikely that contributions will double during that period labor in the remainder of we will negotiate agreements with the ufcw for store associates in ft wayne and little rock negotiations this year will be challenging as we must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting our associates needs for good wages and affordable health care also we must address the underfunding of taft hartley pension plans our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals may be affected by labor disputes particularly as the company seeks to manage health care and pension costs industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions unexpected changes in product costs the state of the economy including interest rates and the

margins as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition and sales shifts to other stores that we operate as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations our results also will be affected by the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in government funded benefit programs consumer confidence and changes in inflation and deflation in product and operating costs our guidance for lifo is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our non fuel operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year our fuel margins could fail to average per gallon if rapid changes in fuel costs occur our capital expenditures and the number of projects that we complete could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores development costs vary from those budgeted our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing of completion of projects any change in tax laws the regulations related thereto the applicable accounting rulesor standards or the interpretation thereof by federal state or local authorities could affect our expected effective tax rate should asset values in the multi employer pension funds further deteriorate or if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation section
