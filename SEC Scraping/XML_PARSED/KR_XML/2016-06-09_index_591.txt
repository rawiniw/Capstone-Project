accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment of the fasb accounting standards codification asc for fair value measurement topic disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent the amendment removes the requirement to present investments for which the practical expedient is used to measure fair value at net asset value nav within the fair value hierarchy table instead an entity would be required to include those investments as a reconciling item so that the total fair value amount of investments in the disclosure is consistent with the fair value investment balance on the statement of net assets available for benefits the amendment is effective for plan years beginning after december however earlier application is permitted the plan management has elected to adopt the early application of the amendment and has applied the provisions retrospectively the adoption had no impact on the statements of net assets available for benefits as of december and december or the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended december in july the fasb issued amendments of the fasb asc for defined contribution pension plans topic under the amendments fully benefit responsive investment contracts are measured presented and disclosed only at contract value certain disclosure requirements are eliminated for both participant directed investments and nonparticipant directed investments and investments both participant directed and nonparticipant directed investments of employee benefit plans are grouped and disclosed only on the basis of general type the amendments are effective for plan years beginning after december however earlier application is permitted plan management has elected to adopt the early application of the amendments and has applied the provisions retrospectively use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and changes therein and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates fully benefit responsive investment contracts fully benefit responsive investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are reported at contract value contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan investment valuation and income recognition as reported by t rowe price trust company a wholly owned subsidiary of t rowe price associates inc the trustee plan investments are reported at fair value fair value is the price that would be received from an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date see note c for a discussion of fair value measurements purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis interest income is recorded on the accrual basis dividends are recorded on the ex dividend date net appreciation and depreciation in fair value of investments is comprised of the net realized and unrealized gains and losses the equity index trust fund is a common collective trust fund operated by the trustee each investors beneficial interest in the net assets of the trust is represented by units an unlimited number of which are authorized unit transactions are subject to terms conditions and limitations defined in the declaration of trust trust units are issued and redeemed only on a valuation date and at the net asset value per unit computed on that date the equity index trust funds financial instruments are valued and its net asset value is computed at the close of the new york stock exchange each day it is open for business the investment objective of the trust is to seek long term capital appreciation by investing primarily in common stocks specifically the trust seeks to replicate the total return of the u s equity market as represented by the sp stock index notes receivable from participants notes receivable from participants are measured at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest delinquent notes receivable from participants are reclassified as distributions based upon the terms of the plan document and the loan policy administrative expenses all direct expenses to the extent allowed by law are charged to the plan direct expenses include trustee investment consulting record keeping legal and auditing expenses related to the plan payment of benefits benefit payments to participants are recorded when paid note c fair value measurements asc topic fair value measurements and disclosure defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques fair value is the price that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction in an asset sale or to transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market valuation techniques that are consistent with the market income or cost approach as specified by asc topic are used to measure fair value the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date level inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date and fair value can be determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability and the reporting entity makes estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the asset or liability including assumptions regarding risk a financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy common stock this investment is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual security is traded this investment is classified within level of the valuation hierarchy mutual funds these investments are publicly traded investment vehicles which are valued daily at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded these investments are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy common collective trust fund this investment is a public investment vehicle valued using the nav provided by the administrator of the fund the nav is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities and then divided by the number of shares outstanding the fair market value of the common collective trust fund has been established using the nav under the practical expedient approach and therefore is not assigned to a level in the hierarchy table the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while plan management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date there have been no changes in the methodologies used at december and the following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the plans investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december and asofdecember level level level total mutual funds kroger shares total investments in fair value hierarchy investments measured at net asset value total investments at fair value asofdecember level level level total mutual funds kroger shares total

other redemption restrictions redemption notice period equity index trust daily none day advance written notice note d stable value fund the stable value fund is a collective trust fund sponsored by t rowe price associates inc each investors beneficial interest in the net assets of the trust is represented by units an unlimited number of which are authorized unit transactions are subject to terms conditions and limitations defined in the declaration of trust trust units are issued and redeemed only on a valuation date and at the net asset value per unit computed on that date trust units may be redeemed on a daily basis to meet benefit payments and other participant initiated withdrawals permitted by retirement plans invested in the trust the investment objectives of the trust are to maximize current income consistent with the maintenance of principal and to provide for withdrawals for certain participant initiated transactions under a retirement plan without penalty or adjustment the trust will attempt to achieve these objectives by investing principally in guaranteed investment contracts gics issued by insurance companies investment contracts issued by banks bics structured or synthetic investment contracts sics issued by banks insurance companies and other issuers as well as the securities supporting such sics underlying assets separate account contracts and other similar instruments that are intended to maintain a constant net asset value while permitting participant initiated benefit responsive withdrawals for certain events the stable value fund investment has been identified as a fully benefit responsive investment participants ordinarily may direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value contract value represents contributions made to the benefit responsive investments plus earnings less participant withdrawals and administrative expenses the benefit responsive investments impose certain restrictions on the plan and the investments themselves may be subject to circumstances that impact their ability to transact at contract value as described in the following paragraphs plan management believes that the occurrence of events that would cause the investments to transact at less than contract value is not probable all investment contracts held by the stable value fund are effected directly between the trust and the issuer of the contract and are nontransferable permitted participant initiated withdrawals refer to withdrawals from the trust by an employer sponsored defined contribution plan directly as a result of participant transactions allowed by the plan such as participant withdrawals for benefits loans or transfers to other funds or trusts within the plan note e income tax status the internal revenue service irs has determined and informed the company by a letter dated june that the plan and related trust are designed in accordance with applicable sections of the internal revenue code irc although the plan has been amended and restated since the effective date of the determination letter the plans administrator believes that the plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the irc except as described below on january the company submitted to the irs a request for determination that the plan and its related trust are qualified under irc section a and a respectively gaap requires the plans management to evaluate tax positions taken by the plan and recognize a tax liability or asset if the plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the irs the plans administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december and there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or disclosure in the financial statements the plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions however there are currently no tax audits for any tax periods in progress on january the company submitted to the irs a request for a compliance statement under the voluntary correction program vcp to resolve certain plan operational failures identified by the plan administrator these failures have been or are being corrected in a manner that the company believes is consistent with established irs correction procedures the plan administrator and counsel for the plan believe that these failures and the vcp application will not impact the tax qualification of the plan and that the plan continues to maintain tax qualified status under the applicable sections of the irc the plan administrator believes that the final outcome of the vcp will not have a material effect on the plans financial statements note f plan termination the company expects to continue the plan indefinitely but has the right to amend or terminate the plan as necessary if the plan were to be terminated plan participants would become fully vested in their account balances and all assets of the plan would be distributed to the individual participants based upon their individual account balances at the date of termination note g party in interest transactions certain plan assets invested in mutual funds with a fair value of and at december and respectively a common collective trust fund with a fair value of and at december and respectively and a fully benefit responsive investment contract with a contract value of and at december and respectively are managed by
