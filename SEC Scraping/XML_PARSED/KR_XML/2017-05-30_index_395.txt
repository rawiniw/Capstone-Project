krogers greenhouse gas emissions are larger than the emissions of nearly one hundred countries investors are concerned that kroger is not adequately addressing its globally significant carbon emissions to mitigate carbon risk reduce costs and add long term value a growing number of corporations are sourcing their own renewable energy forty nine of which have committed to move toward renewable energy sourcing in contrast to its peers kroger corporation continues to make little significant forward progress on reducing the scope and intensity of its carbon emissions or in improving shareholder value through renewable energy adoption this shareholder resolution requests kroger take a first step toward renewable energy adoption by assessing the climate change risk reduction benefits of adopting renewable energy targets proponents urge a yes vote on the proposal resolved clause shareholders request kroger produce a report assessing the climate change risk reduction benefits of adopting quantitative enterprise wide targets for increasing its renewable energy sourcing the report should be produced at reasonable cost and exclude proprietary information supporting

accelerating renewable energy adoption offers the company an important means by which it can reduce risk and protect shareholder value into the future kroger significantly trails peers on reducing climate impacts and renewable energy adoption krogers carbon emissions have continued to rise since its carbon reduction measures have been anemic and krogers renewable energy adoption is negligible compared to its peers the companys lack of substantial action on this issue suggests krogers underestimates the serious risks its environmental underperformance poses to the companys reputation relevance and ongoing competitiveness kroger fails to disclose information allowing shareholders to assess how or whether the company is adequately addressing carbon risk or developing a renewable energy portfolio into the future the companys recent sustainability and carbon disclosure project cdp reporting remain confusing and unclear providing data with moving baselines and targets that while appearing to be significant actually encompass only slight improvements the only discussion of future renewable energy adoption is a statement that three frys stores will be adopting solar discussion climate change poses risks to kroger that remain insufficiently addressed increasing renewable energy adoption will reduce those risks and benefit the company in contrast to most companies today neither krogers annual report nor its proxy statement mention climate change climate risk or consider the risk related to its energy sourcing in contrast retailers like walmart target and costco have recognized the material costs that climate change has on their business in costcos k costco acknowledged that climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at cost and in quantities we currently experience krogers carbon equivalent emissions co e or carbon are increasing as its absolute emissions increase its carbon risk increases creating escalating risks to shareholders and the potential for limiting of future returns customers are increasingly preferential to companies that are pro active on climate and on measures such as renewable energy adoption in choosing companies at which to shop environmental reputation matters regulatory risk also increases for companies that are not proactive state and local governments which bear the brunt of climate impacts are increasingly adopting carbon reduction measures as climate impacts increase the likelihood of more stringent regulations increases krogers significant contributions to global warming also amplify risk factors for physical assets and supply chain access from heat waves to stronger and more frequent storms to greater numbers of pests and droughts krogers own plant operations and

for announced in relies on a year old baseline and not the current year this new goal will therefore only reduce the companys energy use by in total between and an anemic a yearof which the company appears to have accomplished reductions in the current reporting year similarly krogers goal of improving transportation fuel efficiency by is little different from business as usual given current fuel economy standards krogers improvement goal tracks federal emissions requirements that require a increase in fuel efficiency of heavy vehicles by krogers fuel efficiency goal appears to simply follow the companys vehicle replacement schedule lastly the companys reporting on renewable energy describes renewable energy projects it has implemented but does not provide a cohesive enterprise wide renewable energy adoption program apart from renewable energy credits recs the only other renewable energy discussed in krogers most recent cdp report is the companys use of landfill sourced lng and krogers single biogas digester system the carbon offsets of which while important are still insignificant against the billions of pounds of carbon resulting from krogers massive energy consumption consistently higher caliber reporting from kroger would assist shareholders in understanding the impact of its carbon reduction measures and in comparing them to other retail competitors in both and rather than providing clear future oriented reduction goals kroger identified goals with prior year baselines that the company had nearly accomplished inflating the perceived future accomplishment although the companys efforts in previous years are steps in the right direction this recent practice of moving goal posts back every reporting year confuses shareholders and likely decreases krogers impetus to determine a meaningful way forward in achieving significant carbon reduction and renewable energy development the reporting requested by this proposal a study considering the feasibility of krogers adopting a renewable energy target is an important first step in assuring investors that our company is working to effectively remedy its climate risk climate change information request kroger

years is a step in the right direction much more substantial reductions are necessary for kroger to reduce its carbon related regulatory risk and maintain its competitiveness against innovative peers krogers reported carbon intensity of metric tons per sq ft is significantly larger than the carbon intensity of its peers notably walmart reports a carbon intensity of metric tons of carbon equivalent tco e per sq ft of retail space which is half that of krogers and target reports a carbon intensity of tco e per sq ft at its u s locations which is a third that of krogers if kroger were to catch up

discussion of how it plans to expand its renewable capacity beyond this dozen stores and the three additional frys locations at which it hopes to install solar power by comparison walmart has installed solar power on over locations and currently supplies at least times the renewable power of kroger walmart also plans to increase its renewable energy usage by over the next years which puts

reporting it used the same mechanism to announce accomplishments during the then current reporting year that the company had completed in previous years krogers habit of moving the goal posts back every reporting year is confusing and tends to obscure the actual future goals the company has put in place to reduce its energy use kroger will improve transportation efficiency by by using as a baseline year kroger is not required to make any meaningful changes to business as usual in order to meet its transportation efficiency goal the companys transportation efficiency goal generally tracks federal vehicle emissions reduction requirements that require a increase in the fuel efficiency of heavy vehicles by krogers fuel efficiency goal is easily accomplished by the companys regular vehicle replacement schedule conclusion the reporting requested by this proposal provides a first important step toward krogers adoption of greater renewable energy resources as a means of reducing climate risk and accruing benefits that will add to the companys value krogers current slow pace of carbon reduction suggests a failure to recognize the serious risks this underperformance poses to the companys reputation brand regulatory compliance costs supply chain success and ongoing competitiveness with more efficient environmentally conscious peers with supply chains that stretch across the globe krogers operations are extremely vulnerable to the risks of climate change the company has made little headway since the last four carbon related proposals which garnered an average of
