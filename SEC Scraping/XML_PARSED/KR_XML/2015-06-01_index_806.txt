or unrefined conflict minerals and makes no purchases in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country collectively the covered countries given the complexity of our supply chain we necessarily have to rely on our direct suppliers for information regarding the origination of conflict minerals this report has not been subject to an independent private sector audit as allowed under rule p which provides a temporary accommodation for the first two years following november our conflict minerals compliance program in effect during was designed to follow the supplier engagement framework adopted by the organisation for economic co operation and development in their due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict affected and high risk areas second edition and the accompanying supplements for the ts tin tungsten and tantalum and gold oecd due diligence guidance our reasonable country of origin inquiry utilized the electronic industry citizenship coalition and global e sustainability initiatives conflict minerals reporting template the eicc gesi template to survey our first tier suppliers the template was designed by eicc and gesi under the auspices of the oecd due diligence guidance as part of their joint conflict free sourcing initiative to facilitate disclosure and communication of information regarding the supply chain of a downstream company like kroger we adopted the kroger conflict minerals policy which is publicly available on our website at www thekrogerco com vendors suppliers the policy sets forth krogers expectations that our third party suppliers will actively support our compliance efforts by sourcing conflict minerals only from facilities located outside of the covered countries or that have been identified via audit by an independent third party as conflict free if mined or processed in the covered countries completing the eicc gesi template making available information on its due diligence used in determining the source of any conflict minerals upon krogers request and developing policies due diligence frameworks and management systems that are consistent with our policy as previously stated we undertook a review to identify the covered products we then identified direct suppliers of the covered products and sent each supplier a survey the survey included the eicc gesi template and

non responsive supplier requesting that they complete the survey for suppliers that continued to be non responsive kroger personnel followed up directly requesting their participation in the survey

jewelry lighting and outdoor yard dcor items the responses included varying degrees of information regarding the names and locations of smelters or refiners used by the suppliers annex i sets forth the smelters and refiners identified by our suppliers thus far including the country of origin the applicable conflict mineral and the product category based on our due diligence efforts kroger does not have sufficient information to conclusively determine the countries of origin of all of the necessary conflict minerals contained in the covered products or whether these necessary conflict minerals were derived from recycled or scrap sources nor have we been able to identify the mine or location of origin kroger intends to continue to implement steps to improve both the quality and amount of the information gathered from our suppliers through the reasonable country of origin inquiry and due diligence processes to further mitigate the risk that any necessary conflict minerals benefit or finance armed groups in any of the covered countries these steps include but are not limited to the following engage with suppliers that provided incomplete responses or that did not
