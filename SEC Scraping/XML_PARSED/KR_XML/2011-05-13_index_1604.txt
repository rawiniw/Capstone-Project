disclosed for fiscal years ended january and january confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr notes to consolidated financial statements page note accounting policies page segments page we note that you operate retail food and drug stores multi department stores jewelry stores and convenience stores throughout the united states and that these retail operations are reported as a single reportable segment please tell us i the operating segments you have identified in accordance with asc through ii the factors used to identify reportable segments and iii the basis for aggregating identified operating segments into a single reportable segment given the aggregation criteria in asc and quantitative thresholds in asc please be sure to explain to us in detail how the aggregation of all of the retail activities into one reportable segment complies with the aggregation criteria kroger response our retail business which represents over of krogers consolidated sales and ebitda includes retail food and drug stores supermarkets convenience stores c stores and jewelry stores under the guidelines set forth in asc through we have identified operating segments which we refer to as operating divisions within our business our supermarkets include geographically dispersed operating divisions under a variety of banners including kroger king soopers dillons and fred meyer in addition our c stores and our jewelry stores each constitute an individual operating division each of our operating divisions is engaged in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses each has discrete financial information available the operating results of these operating divisions are reviewed regularly by our chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as our chief operating decision makers codms these results are reviewed based on the aggregation of stores in each geographic area not based on the aggregation of stores by format type our operating divisions operate across states and are organized on a geographical basis so that each operating division executive team can be responsive to local needs of the division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the stores in its division we strive to manage our divisions to consistent performance over time not running each operating division as a silo but together as a cohesive network strategic guidance sales planning merchandising marketing procurement operations and support for other administrative functions are managed centrally asc provides that two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of the rule the segments have similar economic characteristics and the segments are similar in all of the following areas a the nature of the products and services b the nature of the production processes c the type or class of customer for their products and services d the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services and e if applicable the nature of the regulatory environment for example banking insurance or public utilities confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr as we discuss below our operating divisions are similar in all of these areas and have similar economic characteristics as well each of our operating divisions offers similar products to consumers and the nature of the production process is similar while we typically use a variety of store formats in each of the supermarket operating divisions such as combination stores multi department stores marketplace stores and fresh fares each supermarket operating division sells a similar mix of products all of our supermarkets offer a broad selection of grocery items and offerings of produce meat and general merchandise health and beauty departments there are some differences in product offerings at different store locations primarily due to store size and demographics of the store location but these differences are not significant in relation to the entire product mix offered for example smaller stores due to size limitations often may not have pharmacies or may have a smaller offering of general merchandise in addition size of the store can also affect the breadth or depth of product offerings in a store the mix of products offered will also vary based on the customer buying habits and demographics of each store for example more ethnic products will be carried in stores that serve a diverse customer base and more value banner products may be carried in stores with a higher than average number of customers who have shopping habits identified as price sensitive however we believe these differences are insubstantial compared to the similarities between product offerings at each supermarket operating division although the nature of the production process in subparagraph b of asc does not apply to how we develop the product mix at our stores the strategic guidance sales planning merchandising marketing procurement operations and administrative functions supporting product mix is managed centrally and thus these functions are substantially the same across our operating divisions redacted each of the operating divisions serves similar customers and operates in the same regulatory environment each operating division serves a broad cross section of the population economically and demographically similar types of customers purchase our products across all of our divisions a particular type or class of customer does not shop in our stores in search of one specific type of product or service our customers typically shop across a variety of products and services from multiple departments within our stores each time they shop in addition all of our retail locations operate in the united states and are subject to substantially similar regulatory issues there is no significant or unusual regulatory environment in one division as compared to another that affects the sale of our products each of our operating divisions purchases and distributes its products in a similar fashion most of the products sold by our operating divisions are purchased from third party consumer product companies and distributed either to our distribution centers or directly to our stores each operating division distributes like products broadly to all of our locations in a similar manner in fact these operating divisions at times receive consumer merchandise from the same distribution centers confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr similar economic characteristics the economic similarities between our operating divisions are evidenced by our approach to managing our retail business as a whole we manage and review all of our operating divisions together as a single portfolio the key metrics that the codms review regularly include id sales trends without fuel and ebitda results without fuel although fuel is an important product offering of our supermarket and c store businesses the key metrics that are reviewed by our codms typically exclude fuel sales and costs frequent fluctuations in the retail price of fuel create significant variations in fuel sales trends as such it is more meaningful for our codms to review identical sales trends without the effect of fuel sales similarly our retail fuel sales reduce our ebitda rates as a percent of sales due to the very low ebitda rates on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales we currently disclose the sales and margin effects of fuel in managements discussion and analysis in our periodic filings with these considerations in mind the codms evaluate the following metrics when assessing performance of and allocating resources to our operating divisions redacted in planning and executing our strategy we strive for parity in results across our markets however the economic competitive and labor environments across all of our markets do not always result in exact parity an important part of how we manage our business is to understand the trends in these and many other areas that affect our business and influence our results so that we can balance our results to be consistent over time we not only seek parity in results but also in execution of our customer ststrategy many of our strategic initiatives are broad appeal in nature as such we typically introduce price or other customer focused initiatives across all of our supermarket operating divisions however the effects on id sales without fuel and ebitda margins are not always the same in each of those operating divisions so though we launch the same program confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr across all of our divisions and achieve consistency in execution across all of our stores this does not always result in identical financial metrics this portfolio management view of our operating divisions by our codms is an important way that they leverage the assets of our company including geographical customer and location diversity to achieve overall results we use the same core product offerings across all of our stores along with consistent execution of strategic plans to drive total company results economic competitive labor and other considerations are built into individual division expectations when results are forecasted to vary from overall expectations typically through the budgeting process nearly half of our jewelry store locations are located inside one of the stores included in a supermarket operating division where our loyalty marketing group identifies the demographics and buying habits of customers at a particular store location as a good fit and size permits that location is considered for an in store jewelry store in addition just like any other in store department customer purchases at all jewelry store locations earn points that can be redeemed for discounts on fuel purchases at one of the companys supermarkets or c stores that sell fuel we have included the jewelry stores in the same operating segment as our other retail businesses because i there are many operational similarities between jewelry and other aspects of our retail business ii due to their relative size we do not believe inclusion of these amounts distorts the results of the overall reportable segment and iii due to their relative size we do not believe that showing the jewelry stores in an other reportable segment is meaningful to investors redacted all of our operating divisions have similar economic characteristics as such we believe that aggregation of our operating divisions into a single operating segment is appropriate under the guidelines previously discussed none of our operating divisions meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reporting under asc and thus we have concluded we have one reportable segment we do believe however that investors may benefit from a more detailed explanation of the factors used to identify our operating divisions including the basis of organization in future form k filings we will add comparable disclosure to our segment footnote as follows the companys domestic retail operations which represent over of the companys consolidated sales and ebitda are its only reportable segment the companys retail operating divisions have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long term financial performance in addition the companys operating divisions offer to its customers similar products have similar distribution methods operate in similar regulatory environments purchase the majority of their merchandise for retail sale from similar and in many cases identical vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location serve similar types of customers and are allocated capital from a centralized location the companys operating divisions reflect the manner in which the business is managed and how the companys chief executive officer and chief operating officer who act as our chief operating decision makers assess performance internally please also see our response to comment below for additional disclosure to be made with respect to product sales information we note that you sell a wide variety of products including grocery products such as produce meat dairy products seafood frozen food bakery and deli products along with non food items such as prescription drugs apparel home fashion and furnishings electronics home goods and toys and health and beauty care items please tell us your consideration of disclosing revenues from each group of similar products and services as contemplated by asc as we believe this information is useful to your investors confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr kroger response after consideration of our products and services sold as contemplated by asc in future form k filings disclosure comparable to the following will be contained in the footnotes to our financial statements redacted note debt obligations page we note that your new credit agreement contains covenants which among other things require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio please tell us whether the covenants restrict your ability to pay dividends and your consideration of disclosing the information required by rule e of regulation s x kroger response our new credit agreement does not restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders respectfully we do not believe a disclosure is necessary to inform our investors that the new credit agreement which has been filed with the sec and is readily available to our investors does not restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends note commitments and contingencies page we note your disclosure with respect to certain legal proceedings that management does not anticipate that the ultimate resolution of such actions will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows please tell us what consideration you gave to providing an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for each of the matters in the aggregate and for those matters where you are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss provide a statement that such an estimate cannot be made please refer to asc confidential treatment requested by the kroger co kr kroger response we considered the guidance from asc for estimates of losses for our legal proceedings for which we have determined that a loss is probable there is not a material difference between the amount accrued and the reasonably likely amount of loss for legal proceedings in which a loss is reasonably possible the range of risk of loss is not significant and we determined that disclosure thereof would not be meaningful to investors we acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filings staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filings and the company may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or
