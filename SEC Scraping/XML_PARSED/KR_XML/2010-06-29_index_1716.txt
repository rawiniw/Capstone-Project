measurements purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis gains or losses on sales of securities are based on average cost dividends are recorded on the ex dividend date income from other investments is recorded as earned investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate a permitted transaction under the terms of the plan the plan invests in investment contracts through the kroger defined contribution plan master

certain employer initiated events i e layoffs mergers bankruptcy plan termination are not eligible for the liquidity guarantee in general issuers may terminate the investment contracts and settle at other than contract value if the qualification status of the employer or plan changes breach of material obligations under the contract and misrepresentation by the contract holder or failure of the underlying portfolio to conform to the pre established investment guidelines the plan administrator does not believe that the occurrence of any such event which would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with participants is probable the following information relates to the master trust interest in investment contracts in thousands contract value fair value crediting interest rate range to to current crediting rate average yield the crediting interest rate range for the investment contracts is based upon the contract rate or a predetermined formula that factors in duration market value and book value of the investment certain of the crediting rates are adjusted quarterly the minimum crediting interest rate for these investments is zero table of contents master trust in thousands the following is financial information with respect to the master trust december and investment holdings at fair value kroger co common stock mutual funds cash and cash equivalents

corporate government and mortgage backed debt securities as of december and the plans interest in the net assets of the master trust was and respectively the master trust allocates individual assets to each plan participating in the master trust arrangement therefore the investment results of the plan may not reflect its proportionate interest in the master trust fair value measurements for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value generally accepted accounting principles define fair value and establish a framework for measuring fair value and disclosing the fair value measurements utilized the standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists generally accepted accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value into three levels level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date table of contents level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk the assets fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the following is a description of the valuation methods used for assets measured at fair value there have been no changes in methodologies used at december and cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value common stocks the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded mutual funds the fair values of these securities are primarily based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded guaranteed investment contracts the investments include cash and cash equivalents fixed maturity guaranteed investment contracts gics and constant duration gics the fair value of the investments are calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable duration wall street journal gic index rates fair values for variable synthetic gics are calculated using the present value of the contracts future cash flow values discounted by comparable swap rates fair values for constant duration synthetic gics are calculated using the market values provided by the external investment managers collective trusts the collective trust funds are public investment vehicles valued using a net asset value nav provided by the manager of each fund the nav is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding the navs unit price is quoted on a private market that is not active however the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund which are traded on an active market and valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded the significant investment strategies of the funds are as described in the financial statements provided by each fund there are no restrictions on redemptions from these funds retirement date funds retirement date funds are made up of investments in mutual funds custom funds and collective trusts and are valued in a manner consistent with that described above for mutual funds and the interest in master trust table of contents participant loans participant loans are valued at their outstanding amortized balances which approximate fair value the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuations methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement investment securities in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is reasonably possible that changes in the fair values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits while all the investments of the participating plans are deemed part of the master trust each plan does maintain a separate accounting of its share of the investments in the master trust which is reflected below the following
