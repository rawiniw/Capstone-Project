packaging in nearly countries at a un environment assembly called for an end to plastic pollution in the european commission released a plastics policy strategy calling for a timeline for all packaging to be recyclable the same topic as this shareholder proposal this proposal has previously received substantial support by kroger shareholders for five consecutive years this includes a vote in in in and in the latest vote represents nearly billion in shareholder value yet the company has taken no substantive actions in response the proposal the proposal asks the company to issue a report assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use non recyclable packaging for its house brands the supporting statement requests that the report include assessment of reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use non recyclable brand packaging and goals and a timeline to phase out non recyclable packaging why this is important there are two compelling reasons why shareholders should support this proposal the enormous waste and inefficiency represented by non recyclable packaging suggests management inattention to design for sustainability and lack of recognition by management of growing scientific data linking plastic packaging to threats to marine animals and potentially to human health americans throw away more materials than any other country pounds per person per day paper and packaging materials comprise the largest category of municipal solid waste at about barely half of these materials are recovered for recycling but recovery rates for the fastest growing packaging materialsplastics are especially low at just as the u s struggles to recycle more packaging the effort is compounded by companies like kroger that are unnecessarily placing non recyclable packaging onto the market when readily available recyclable alternatives exist flexible and pouch packaging is no longer a niche material it is now the second largest packaging segment in the united states after corrugated cardboard representing percent of the billion u s packaging market about billion single material and multi layer pouches are used

among others calls for a priority focus on finding recyclable alternatives to unrecyclable multi material plastic packaging such as pouches many companies use life cycle assessment lca to guide them on packaging sustainability but have mostly focused on product light weighting materials use reduction and eliminating manufacturing waste the company discusses light weighting in its response to our proposal see below in many cases these goals were easy to achieve because using lighter and fewer materials saves money but lcas dont adequately factor post consumer impacts that represent lost revenue from billions of dollars of wasted commodities and potential risk from ocean pollution from degraded plastics lcas dont include good data on the persistence or accumulation of plastics in the environment post consumer as the science in this area is still evolving as a result its not clear assessments can yet adequately assess risk if these materials end up in oceans and cause harm to birds and fish the nations largest waste hauler waste management inc says reliance on lca often leads to decisions made at the expense of recyclability great designs that are sustainable on many fronts are beginning to push low value and the materials are hard to capture into the recycling marketplace said tom carpenter director of waste management sustainability services on the back end you are left with bales of unwanted materials or mixed residues destined for landfill as the value of materials continue to degrade and hybrid products i e pouches increase it is becoming harder to justify new technologies to effectively capture the ever evolving packages from a market perspective both company management and shareholders should be concerned that billions of dollars of valuable materials are being wasted one assessment concludes that billion of recyclable plastics are waste annually in the u s the ocean pollution threat a second compelling reason to support the proposal is managements

plastics in these ocean gyres pose threats to marine animals and potentially to human health food and beverage packaging and containers are among the top items found on beaches and coastlines non recyclable packaging is more likely to be littered than recyclable packaging as these materials slowly degrade in the ocean they break down into small indigestible particles that birds and marine mammals mistake for food ingestion of plastics results in a range of threats to marine species including starvation malnutrition intestinal blockage and intake of toxins recent research indicates these particles absorb potent toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them into the marine food web studies are starting to point towards larger long term impacts of toxic pollutants absorbed transported and consumed by fish and other marine life with potential to affect human health a study published in the journal science concluded the oceans are

of single use packaging in the ocean if the company does not respond and develop policies and practices to address these issues it could risk brand damage response to krogers statement in opposition the company discusses a goal to optimize packaging by by considering recyclability along with other attributes such as food safety quality cost etc when choosing packaging the mere mention of a commitment to optimize packaging is not responsive to the proposal which seeks a report with specific information on research and to plans to phase out non recyclable packaging the company mentions that several years ago it committed to reduce plastic in its packaging by million pounds this is a welcome step but light weighting of plastics by itself does not necessarily reduce plastic pollution
