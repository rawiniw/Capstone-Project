our sec filings as well as the following matters in deciding whether to purchase the notes our indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our borrowing costs as of august our total outstanding indebtedness including capital leases and the current portion thereof and excluding the market value adjustment required by gaap for interest rate hedges was approximately billion as of august we maintained a billion revolving credit facility that terminates on june outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit facility in addition to the credit facility as of august we maintained two uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit facility as of august we had billion of outstanding commercial paper and no borrowings under the credit facility or money market lines the outstanding letters of credit that reduced the funds available under our credit facility totaled million as of august this indebtedness could reduce our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures our needs for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict these factors include results of operations the timing and cost of acquisitions and efforts to expand existing operations we believe that we will have sufficient funds from all sources to meet our needs over the next several years we cannot assure you however that our business will generate cash flow at or above current levels if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our debt and make necessary investments we will be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt seek new borrowings forego strategic opportunities or delay scale back or eliminate some aspects of our operations if necessary any of these actions could have a material negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations the notes will effectively rank equal in right of payment with approximately billion of our other indebtedness as of august our sources of liquidity are dependent upon our lenders honoring their commitments our billion committed revolving credit facility maturing on june continues to remain available letters of credit totaling million as of august reduce amounts available under the credit facility commercial paper borrowings also reduce amounts available under the credit facility as of august we had billion of outstanding commercial paper in addition we maintain uncommitted money market lines totaling million our liquidity could be affected if our committed lenders are unable or unwilling to honor their contractual obligations to us s table of contents our operations may be negatively impacted by a variety of factors we obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing stores our ability to generate sales and earnings could be adversely affected by the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate in addition a prolonged labor dispute delays in opening new stores changes in the economic climate unexpected changes in product cost weather conditions and natural disasters government regulations or other unanticipated events could adversely affect our operations the company kroger was founded in and was incorporated in we maintain our corporate offices in cincinnati ohio and as of august we were one of the largest grocery retailers in the united states based on annual sales as of august directly or through subsidiaries we operated approximately supermarkets and multidepartment stores convenience stores supermarket fuel centers and fine jewelry stores some of the convenience stores were franchised to third parties we also operated directly or through subsidiaries manufacturing facilities that permit us to offer quality low cost private label products use of proceeds we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us we expect to use the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase some of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes conflicts of interest if any member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra participating in this offering receives or more of the net proceeds of the offering by reason of the repayment of our debt that member will be deemed to have a conflict of interest within the meaning of finra rule and this offering will be conducted in accordance with
