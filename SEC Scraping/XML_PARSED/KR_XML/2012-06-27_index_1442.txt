see note for discussion of fair value purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis gains or losses on sales of securities are based on average cost interest income and dividend income are recorded on the date received by the plan investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate a permitted transaction under the terms of the plan the plan invests in investment contracts through the master trust the statement of net assets available for benefits presents the fair value of the investment in the master trust as well as the adjustment of the investment in the master trust from fair value to contract value

investment provides a liquidity guarantee by a financially responsible third party of principal and previously accrued interest for liquidations transfers loans or withdrawals initiated by plan participants under the terms of the ongoing plan certain employer initiated events i e layoffs mergers bankruptcy plan termination are not eligible for the liquidity guarantee in general issuers may terminate the investment contracts and settle at other than contract value if the qualification status of the employer or plan changes breach of material obligations under the contract and misrepresentation by the contract holder or failure of the underlying portfolio to conform to the pre established investment guidelines the plan administrator does not believe that the occurrence of any such event which would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with participants is probable the following information relates to the master trust interest in investment contracts contract value fair value crediting interest rate range to to current crediting rate average yield table of contents the crediting interest rate range for the investment contracts is based upon the

arrangement therefore the investment results of the plan may not reflect its proportionate interest in the master trust fair value measurements for financial statement elements currently required to be measured at fair value financial accounting standards board fasb defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price regardless of whether an observable liquid market price exists fasb establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value into three levels level includes observable inputs which reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date level includes observable inputs for assets or liabilities other than quoted prices included in level and it includes valuation techniques which use prices for similar assets and liabilities level includes unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk the assets fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation table of contents techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the following is a description of the valuation methods used for assets measured at fair value there have been no changes in methodologies used at december and cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value common stocks the fair values of these securities are based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded mutual funds the fair values of these securities are primarily based on observable market quotations for identical assets and are valued at the

values for constant duration synthetic gics are calculated using the market values provided by the external investment managers collective trusts the collective trust funds are public investment vehicles valued using a net asset value nav provided by the manager of each fund the nav is based on the underlying net assets owned by the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding the navs unit price is quoted on a private market that is not active however the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying securities within the fund which are traded on an active market and valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which those individual securities are traded the significant investment strategies of the funds are as described in the financial statements provided by each fund there are no restrictions on redemptions from these funds retirement date funds retirement date funds are made up of investments in mutual funds custom funds and collective trusts and are valued in a manner consistent with that described above the methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values furthermore while the plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement while all the investments of the participating plans are deemed part of the master trust each plan does maintain a separate accounting of its share of the investments in the master trust table of contents the following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the master trusts assets at

internal revenue service stated that the plan as then designed complied with the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code irc the plan has been amended since receiving this letter in january the plan applied for a new determination letter but has not yet received a response the plan administrator believes that the plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the irc therefore no provision for income taxes has been included in the plans financial statements accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the plan and recognize a tax liability or asset if the plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service the plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or asset or disclosure in the financial statements the plan is subject to routine audits by table of contents taxing jurisdictions however there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress the plan administrator believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for the years prior to risks and uncertainties the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market and credit risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the statement of net assets available for benefits plan termination although it has not expressed any intent to do so the company has
