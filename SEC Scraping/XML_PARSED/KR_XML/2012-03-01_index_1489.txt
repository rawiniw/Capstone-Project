structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging to plus a dividend of to for a total shareholder return of approximately to kroger expects this total shareholder return to compare favorably to the sp over a rolling three to five year time horizon annual earnings per share growth for fiscal will be higher than this due to a combination of the benefit of a rd week a lower expected lifo charge our ability to aggressively repurchase stock during and benefits from the pension plan consolidation share repurchases since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market on february kroger invested million to repurchase million shares leaving million remaining under the billion stock repurchase program announced in september our ability to achieve identical supermarket sales and earnings growth and earnings per share goals as well as the timing that those earnings occur within the year may be affected by labor disputes particularly as the company seeks to manage health care and pension costs industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors the aggressiveness of competition and our response to these activities unexpected changes in product costs the state of the economy including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing behavior in response to economic conditions as well as rising fuel and food prices the number of shares outstanding the success of our future growth plans goodwill impairment changes in government funded benefit programs volatility in our fuel margins increased fuel costs and the effect those increases have on consumer spending the effect of prescription drugs going off patent has on our sales and earnings our expectations regarding our ability to obtain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors such as express scripts and our ability to generate sales at desirable margins as well as the success of our programs designed to increase our identical sales without fuel in addition any delays in opening new stores failure to achieve tonnage growth as expected or changes in the economic climate could cause us to fall short of our sales and earnings targets our ability to increase identical supermarket sales also could be adversely affected by increased competition and sales shifts to other stores that we operate as well as increases in sales of our corporate brand products earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation and the benefits that we receive from the consolidation of the ufcw pension plans our guidance for lifo is based on our forecast of cost changes for products in our inventory our estimate of product cost changes could be affected by general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our non fuel fifo operating margin guidance could change if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if our strategies fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected by changes in product costs during the year our earnings per share results also will be affected by our ability to improve our operating results and our ability to repurchase shares under our repurchase program as expected our capital expenditures and the number of projects that we complete could vary from our expectations if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores development costs vary from those budgeted our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen square footage growth during the year is dependent upon our ability to acquire desirable sites for construction of new facilities as well as the timing of completion of projects our plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures repurchase shares pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current debt rating will depend on our ability to generate free cash flow and otherwise to have cash on hand which will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the extent to which funds can be used for those reasons while maintaining our debt rating any change in tax laws the regulations related thereto the applicable accounting rulesor standards or the interpretation thereof by federal state or local authorities could affect our expected tax rate should asset values in the multi employer pension funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions and pension expense could increase more than we have anticipated likewise if health care expenses continue to grow at a faster pace than expected our incremental cost for those expenses will exceed our expectations the actual amount of cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of employees who participate and the level of their participation total shareholder return and the extent to which it compares favorably to the sp over a rolling three to five year time horizon and our ability to continue to reward shareholders in through increased earnings quarterly dividends and share repurchases will be affected by all of the factors identified above as well as the ability for the company to pay dividends from free cash
