governmental authority is required for the due execution delivery and performance by the borrower of the credit agreement the credit agreement constitutes the legal valid and binding obligation of the borrower enforceable against the borrower in accordance with its terms in general an ohio court would give effect to the choice of law provisions in the credit agreement which specify new york law as the applicable law other than instances where ohio law specifically governs ohio property persons or activities for example with respect to real property and choice of law rulesunder the uniform commercial code ucc the supreme court of ohio has validated contractual choice of law provisions jarvis v ashland oil inc ohio st d schulke radio productions ltd v midwestern broadcasting co ohio st d in the latter case the supreme court held that the parties may choose the law applicable to their contract unless i the state whose law is chosen has no substantial relationship to the parties or to the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice or ii application of the chosen law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state having a materially greater interest in the issue than the chosen state and such other state would be the state of applicable law in the absence of a choice by the parties in addition ohio revised code r c ucc provides generally with respect to ucc matters not including issues specifically addressed to the contrary by the ohio ucc that when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to ohio and also to another state the parties may agree that the law of either ohio or of such other state shall govern their rights and duties under the present circumstances it would appear that the parties stipulation that the law of new york should control should be given effect in ohio this conclusion is based upon our understanding that the transactions provided for in the credit agreement were negotiated primarily in new york

at law c i express no opinion as to i section of the credit agreement insofar as it provides that any lender purchasing a participation from another lender pursuant thereto may exercise set off or similar rights with respect to such participation and ii the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the state of ohio wherein any lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the credit
