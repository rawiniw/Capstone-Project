had an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share recently adopted accounting standards in january the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures which were effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december except for disclosures about certain level activity that became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december the new standards require the company to disclose transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in level fair value measurements the new standards also require a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements the company adopted the amended standards effective january except for disclosures about certain level activity the company adopted the amended standards for disclosures about certain level activity effective january see note to the consolidated financial statements for the companys fair value measurements and disclosures commitments and contingencies the company continuously evaluates contingencies based upon the best available evidence the company believes that allowances for loss have been provided to the extent necessary and that its assessment of contingencies is reasonable to the extent that resolution of contingencies results in amounts that vary from the companys estimates future earnings will be charged or credited the principal contingencies are described below insurance the companys workers compensation risks are self insured in most states in addition other workers compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans deductible plans and self insured retention plans the liability for workers compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are all reinsured with unrelated insurance companies operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances based upon actuarially determined estimates litigation on october the company petitioned the tax court ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc v commissioner of internal revenue docket no for a redetermination of deficiencies asserted by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section h of the internal revenue code the commissioner determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section h of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition therefore does not qualify for a section h election on january the tax court issued its opinion upholding the companys position that the acquisition of the stock qualified as a purchase granting the companys motion for partial summary judgment and denying the tax commissioners motion the company anticipates that all remaining issues in the matter will be resolved and the tax court will enter its decision the parties will then have days to file an appeal as of may an adverse decision would have required a cash payment of up to approximately including interest any accounting implications of an adverse decision in this case would be charged through the statement of operations on february the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertsons inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co united states district court central district of california case no cv alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the agreement between the company albertsons inc and safeway inc collectively the retailers which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailer s but not the other retailer s during the labor dispute in southern california violated section of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may pursuant to a stipulation between the parties the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants the attorney general appealed a trial court ruling to the ninth circuit court of appeals and the defendants appealed a separate ruling on august the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the agreement violated section of the sherman act and it remanded the matter to the district court for entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and for any further proceedings consistent with its opinion on february the court determined to re hear the appeal en banc based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and or seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite managements current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in managements evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows assignments the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees is unable to fulfill its lease obligations due to the wide distribution of the companys assignments among third parties and various other remedies available the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote benefit plans the company administers certain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans and contributory defined contribution retirement plans for substantially all non union employees and some union represented employees as determined by the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements funding for the defined benefit pension plans is based on a review of the specific requirements and an evaluation of the assets and liabilities of each plan funding for the companys matching and automatic contributions under the defined contribution plans is based on years of service plan compensation and amount of contributions by participants in addition to providing pension benefits the company provides certain health care benefits for retired employees funding for the retiree health care benefits occurs as claims or premiums are paid the determination of the obligation and expense for the companys defined benefit retirement pension plan and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the companys selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in the companys annual report on form k and include among other things the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company did not make any contributions to its company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in the first quarter of we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions the company expects that any contributions made during will reduce its minimum required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions in addition the company expects its cash contributions and expense to the k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in compared to the company also contributes to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of its collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans based on the most recent information available to it the company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits because the company is one of a number of employers contributing to these plans it is difficult to ascertain what the companys share of the underfunding would be although we anticipate the companys contributions to these plans will increase each year the company believes that levels of underfunding have not changed significantly since year end as a result the company expects meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years to reduce this underfunding moreover if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds the company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably determined fair value measurements and derivative financial instruments the company has certain derivative and financial instruments recorded at fair value which primarily relate to fair value hedges on fixed to floating interest rate swaps on certain debt and available for sale securities these instruments have not materially changed in fair value since disclosure in the annual report on form k of the kroger co for the fiscal year ended january fair value of other financial instruments current and long term debt the fair value of the companys long term debt including current maturities was estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues adjusted for illiquidity based on available market evidence if quoted market prices were not available the fair value was based on the net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at may and january at may the fair value of total debt was compared to a carrying value of at january the fair value of total debt was compared to a carrying value of cash and temporary cash investments store deposits in transit receivables prepaid and other current assets accounts payable accrued salaries and wages and other current liabilities the carrying amounts of these items approximated fair value long term investments the fair values of these investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments or estimated cash flows if appropriate at may and january the carrying and fair value of long term investments for which fair value is determinable was and respectively item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements overview first quarter total sales were billion compared with billion for the same period of this increase was attributable to identical supermarket sales increases higher average retail fuel prices and increased fuel gallon sales the average price for a gallon of fuel sold at our fuel stations was higher in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of identical supermarket sales without fuel increased in the first quarter of identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to product cost inflation increased transaction count an increase in the average sale per shopping trip and an increase in the number of households shopping with us our first quarter identical supermarket sales performance excluding fuel was broad based across the country each one of our eighteen supermarket divisions had positive identical supermarket sales growth this continues our trend of positive identical supermarket sales growth for consecutive quarters our customer ststrategy continues to deliver solid results for the first quarter of net earnings totaled million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for the same period of the results for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of benefited from increased supermarket sales productivity improvements and effective cost controls partially offset by increases in lifo credit card fees health care and pension costs net earnings from our fuel operations remained consistent with the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of based on the strength of our results for the first quarter of which is partially offset by the higher estimated lifo charge for the year we have increased both the lower and upper range of our guidance for both annual identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share for fiscal year please refer to the outlook section for more information on our expectations our customer ststrategy is continuing to connect with customers we have shown that our focus on people products prices and the shopping experience is meaningful to customers through both good and challenging times as a result we believe the ability to create and deliver shareholder value in a variety of operating environments is a key part of our value proposition for investors results of operations net earnings net earnings totaled million for the first quarter of an increase of from net earnings of million for the first quarter of the increase in our net earnings for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of resulted primarily from an increase in non fuel operating profit partially offset by a higher effective tax rate net earnings from our fuel operations remained consistent with the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of the increase in non fuel operating profit for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of resulted primarily from the benefit of increased supermarket sales productivity improvements and effective cost controls partially offset by increases in our lifo charge credit card fees health care and pension costs net earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of represented an increase of over net earnings of per diluted share for the first quarter of net earnings per diluted share increased in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of due to increased net earnings and the repurchase of million shares of our common stock over the past four quarters sales total sales in millions firstquarter percentage increase percentage increase total supermarket sales without fuel total supermarket fuel sales total supermarket sales other sales total sales other sales primarily relate to sales by convenience stores including fuel jewelry stores manufacturing plants to outside customers variable interest entities and in store health clinics the increase in total sales and total supermarket sales for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of was primarily the result of our identical supermarket sales increase excluding fuel of and an increase in supermarket fuel sales of total supermarket fuel sales increased over the same period in due to a increase in average retail fuel prices and a increase in fuel gallons sold the increase in the average supermarket retail fuel price was caused by an increase in the product cost of fuel identical supermarket sales excluding fuel increased primarily due to product cost inflation increased transaction count an increase in the average sale per shopping trip and an increase in the number of households shopping with us we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multi department stores our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below we used the identical supermarket dollar figures presented to calculate first quarter percent changes identical supermarket sales in millions firstquarter including fuel centers excluding fuel centers including fuel centers excluding fuel centers fifo gross margin we calculate first in first out fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs including advertising warehousing and transportation but excluding the last in first out lifo charge merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness our fifo gross margin rate was for the first quarter of as compared to for the first quarter of retail fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales excluding the effect of retail fuel operations our first quarter fifo gross margin rate decreased basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the first quarter of this decrease in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of resulted primarily from continued investments in lower prices for our customers and higher diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations offset partially by favorable shrink results lifo charge the lifo charge was million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of the lifo charge increased in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of primarily due to our expected increase in annualized product cost inflation in most major categories for compared to operating general and administrative expenses operating general and administrative oga expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs utilities and credit card fees rent expense depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense are not included in oga oga expenses as a percentage of sales decreased basis points to for the first quarter of from for the first quarter of primarily due to the benefit of increased supermarket sales and higher average retail fuel prices retail fuel sales lower our oga rate due to the very low oga rate as a percentage of sales of retail fuel sales compared to non fuel sales oga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased basis points in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of this decrease in our oga rate as a percentage of sales excluding the effect of fuel resulted primarily from the benefit of increased supermarket sales productivity improvements and effective cost controls offset partially by increased credit card fees and health care and pension costs rent expense rent expense was million in both the first quarters of and rent expense as a percentage of sales was in the first quarter of compared to in the first quarter of rent expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel decreased five basis points in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of the decrease in rent expense as a percentage of sales excluding fuel reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing whenever possible and the benefit of increased supermarket sales depreciation expense depreciation expense was million or of total sales for the first quarter of compared to million or of total sales for the first quarter of the increase in depreciation expense in total dollars was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures including acquisitions and lease buyouts of billion during the last rolling four quarter period ending with the first quarter of the decrease in our depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the benefit of increased supermarket sales and higher average retail fuel prices excluding the effect of retail fuel operations depreciation as a percentage of sales decreased two basis points in the first quarter of compared to the same period of interest expense net interest expense was million or of total sales for the first quarter of compared to million or of total sales for the first quarter of the increase in net interest expense for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of resulted primarily from a higher weighted average debt balance and a decrease in the benefit from interest rate swaps income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the first quarter of and for the first quarter of the and effective income tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operating activities during the first quarter of compared to billion in the first quarter of the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital changes in working capital provided cash from operating activities of million in the first quarter of and million in the first quarter of this decrease in the change in working capital was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses in the first quarter of compared to a decrease in the first quarter of this increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to a decision not to pre fund our voluntary employee benefit account at the end of fiscal year compared to a million pre funding at the end of fiscal year the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of primarily due to an overpayment of taxes applied to net cash used by investing activities we used million of cash for investing activities during the first quarter of compared to million during the first quarter of the amount of cash used for investing activities decreased in the first quarter of versus primarily due to decreased cash payments for capital expenditures net cash used by financing activities we used billion of cash for financing activities in the first quarter of compared to million in the first quarter of the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of was primarily related to the increase in treasury stock purchases offset partially by decreased payments on long term debt and our investment in the remaining interest of a variable interest entity in the first quarter of proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulted from exercises of employee stock options debt management as of may we maintained a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that unless extended terminates on may outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreement in addition to the credit agreement we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement as of may we had no borrowings under our credit agreement money market lines or outstanding commercial paper the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of may our bank credit facility and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants as of may we were in compliance with these financial covenants furthermore management believes it is not reasonably likely that kroger will fail to comply with these financial covenants in the foreseeable future total debt including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations decreased million to billion as of the end of the first quarter of from billion as of the end of the first quarter of total debt decreased million as of the end of the first quarter of from billion as of year end the decrease as of the end of the first quarter of compared to the end of the first quarter of resulted from the payment at maturity in the first quarter of of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of partially offset by the issuance in the second quarter of of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of as of may our cash and temporary cash investments were million compared to million as of january this decrease was primarily due to the increased share repurchase activity noted below common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of we invested million to repurchase million shares of kroger stock at an average price of per share these shares were reacquired under three separate stock repurchase programs the first was a million repurchase program that was authorized by krogers board of directors on june the second is a billion repurchase program replacing the first program that was authorized by krogers board of directors on march the third is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in krogers stock option and long term incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately billion which includes anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of the first quarter of based on current operating trends we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months in addition to the sources of liquidity noted above we also expect to be able to fund future scheduled principal payments of long term debt from our cash flows from operating activities and if necessary by issuing additional debt we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities totaled million for the first quarter of compared to million for the first quarter of during the first quarter of we opened acquired expanded or relocated ten food stores and also completed within the wall remodels total food store square footage decreased from the first quarter of excluding acquisitions and operational closings total food store square footage increased in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled million in the first quarter of compared to million in the first quarter of critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner except as noted below our critical accounting policies are summarized in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could vary from those estimates recently adopted accounting standards in january the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures which were effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december except for disclosures about certain level activity that became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december the new standards require us to disclose transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in level fair value measurements the new standards also require a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements we adopted the amended standards effective january except for disclosures about certain level activity we adopted the amended standards for disclosures about certain level activity effective january see note to the consolidated financial statements for our fair value measurements and disclosures outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about krogers future performance these statements are based on managements assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available such statements relate to among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co identical supermarket sales growth expected product cost expected pension plan contributions our ability to generate operating cash flow projected capital expenditures square footage growth opportunities to reduce costs cash flow requirements and our operating plan for the future and are indicated by words such as comfortable committed will expect goal should intend target believe anticipate plan and similar words or phrases these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations projections beliefs intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate uncertainties about the general economy our labor relations our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for based on the current operating environment we expect to achieve results near the top end of this range this range reflects the strength of our first quarter results and the higher estimated lifo charge of million we expect the second and third quarter earnings per diluted share growth rates to be near the low end of our full year earnings per share growth expectations due to tax benefits recognized in we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel sales of in for we will continue to focus on improving sales growth in accordance with our customer ststrategy by making investments in gross margin and customer shopping experiences we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions we would expect a slight increase in non fuel operating margin for compared to excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge assuming net earnings per diluted share is near the top end of our range for for we expect fuel margins which can be highly volatile to be approximately per gallon and we expect continued strong growth in total fuel gallons sold for we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million this forecast is based on estimated product cost inflation for products in our inventory of for we expect interest expense to be approximately million we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments to maintain our current debt coverage ratios to pay cash dividends and to repurchase stock as market conditions change we may re evaluate these uses of cash flow we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage as well as from increased productivity from existing locations capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels in addition we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate logistics and technology improvements the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations logistics manufacturing procurement category management merchandising and buying practices and should reduce merchandising costs we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements we expect capital investments for to be in the range of billion excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings based on current operating trends we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions we believe we have adequate sources of cash if needed under our credit facility and other borrowing sources we expect that our oga results will be affected by increased costs such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately excluding the resolution of any tax issues we expect rent expense as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration productivity improvements and shrink we intend to invest most of these savings in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers we do not expect to make a cash contribution to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during if a contribution is made to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions we expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately million in addition we expect k retirement savings account plan cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in compared to we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans in subject to collective bargaining in addition we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years as we negotiate changes in contributions and benefits we do not anticipate additional goodwill impairments in we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in covering store employees in southern california memphis and west virginia we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters who represent some of our associates in distribution and manufacturing operations in the midwest upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements work stoppagesby the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions a prolonged work stoppageaffecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results in all of these contracts rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations we expect our business model to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth on average of to over a rolling three to five year time horizon including our dividend our business model is expected to generate total shareholder return on average of to over a rolling three to five year time period various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit including our bank credit facilities could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us changes in market conditions could affect our cash flow our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes industry consolidation pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors including non traditional competitors and the aggressiveness of that competition our response to these actions the state of the economy including interest rates the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities and the unemployment rate the effect that increased fuel costs have on consumer spending changes in government funded benefit programs manufacturing commodity costs diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations trends in consumer spending the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments as well as operating conditions including inflation or deflation increased competitive activity and cautious spending behavior of our customers our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions weather availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging and other factors beyond our control our ability to pass on product cost increases will depend on the reactions of our customers and competitors to those increases our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated and our failure to generate expected earnings our lifo charge and the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized in addition to the factors identified above our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing our operating margins without fuel could decline or fail to meet expectations if we are unable to pass on any cost increases if we fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations we could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel a change in our operating costs or if a pattern of rapid changes in fuel costs occurs we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business as well as to the material litigation facing kroger and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable unexpected outcomes in these matters however could result in an adverse effect on our earnings consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business either favorable or unfavorable cannot be foreseen rent expense which includes subtenant rental income could be adversely affected by the state of the economy increased store closure activity and future consolidation depreciation expense which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets or the remaining terms of leases use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants savings rate plan compensation and length of service of participants our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated should asset values in these funds deteriorate if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability or should our estimates prove to be understated our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated if volatility in the financial markets continues or worsens our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated in future years changes in laws or regulations including changes in accounting standards taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers which could affect sales and earnings changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators for example we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base since gasoline generates low profit margins we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin gasoline sales provide a positive effect on oga expense as a percentage of sales our capital expenditures expected square footage growth and number of store projects completed over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores if development costs vary from those budgeted if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected or if economic conditions fail to improve or worsen interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment changes in our credit ratings fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt impairment losses including goodwill could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows market values or business valuations in the market our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment real estate market values competitive activity inflation and customer behavior our estimated expense and obligation for kroger sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts these assumptions include among others the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products or may decrease customer demand for certain products increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products additionally increases in the cost of inputs such as utility costs or raw material costs could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings although we presently operate only in the united states civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions particularly to the extent that hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations including the cost of transportation we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on krogers business we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information accordingly actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from the information provided in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on our form k for the fiscal year ended january item controls and procedures the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer together with a disclosure review committee appointed by the chief executive

information item legal proceedings various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws as well as product liability cases are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and or seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows for a further discussion of our legal proceedings see note to our consolidated financial statements the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains

be charged or credited the principal contingencies are described below insurance the companys workers compensation risks are self insured in most states in addition other workers compensation risks and certain levels of insured general liability risks are based on retrospective premium plans deductible plans and self insured retention plans the liability for workers compensation risks is accounted for on a present value basis actual claim settlements and expenses incident thereto may differ from the provisions for loss property risks have been underwritten by a subsidiary and are all reinsured with unrelated insurance companies operating divisions and subsidiaries have paid premiums and the insurance subsidiary has provided loss allowances based upon actuarially determined estimates litigation on october the company petitioned the tax court ralphs grocery company and subsidiaries formerly known as ralphs supermarkets inc v commissioner of internal revenue docket no for a redetermination of deficiencies asserted by the commissioner of internal revenue the dispute at issue involves a transaction in which ralphs holding company acquired the stock of ralphs grocery company and made an election under section h of the internal revenue code the commissioner determined that the acquisition of the stock was not a purchase as defined by section h of the internal revenue code and that the acquisition therefore does not qualify for a section h election on january the tax court issued its opinion upholding the companys position that the acquisition of the stock qualified as a purchase granting the companys motion for partial summary judgment and denying the tax commissioners motion the company anticipates that all remaining issues in the matter will be resolved and the tax court will enter its decision the parties will then have days to file an appeal as of may an adverse decision would have required a cash payment of up to approximately including interest any accounting implications of an adverse decision in this case would be charged through the statement of operations on february the attorney general for the state of california filed an action in los angeles federal court california ex rel lockyer v safeway inc dba vons a safeway company albertsons inc and ralphs grocery company a division of the kroger co united states district court central district of california case no cv alleging that the mutual strike assistance agreement the agreement between the company albertsons inc and safeway inc collectively the retailers which was designed to prevent the union from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing such retailer s but not the other retailer s during the labor dispute in southern california violated section of the sherman act the lawsuit seeks declarative and injunctive relief on may pursuant to a stipulation between the parties the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants the attorney general appealed a trial court ruling to the ninth circuit court of appeals and the defendants appealed a separate ruling on august the ninth circuit court of appeals held that the agreement violated section of the sherman act and it remanded the matter to the district court for entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and for any further proceedings consistent with its opinion on february the court determined to re hear the appeal en banc based on the information presently available to the company management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this action will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business including suits charging violations of certain antitrust wage and hour or civil rights laws are pending against the company some of these suits purport or have been determined to be class actions and or seek substantial damages any damages that may be awarded in antitrust cases will be automatically trebled although it is not possible at this time to evaluate the merits of all of these claims and lawsuits nor their likelihood of success the company is of the belief that any resulting liability will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows the company continually evaluates its exposure to loss contingencies arising from pending or threatened litigation and believes it has made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable nonetheless assessing and predicting the outcomes of these matters involve substantial uncertainties it remains possible that despite managements current belief material differences in actual outcomes or changes in managements evaluation or predictions could arise that could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows assignments the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees is unable to fulfill its lease obligations due to the wide distribution of the companys assignments among third parties and various other remedies available the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote benefit plans the company administers certain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans and contributory defined contribution retirement plans for substantially all non union employees and some union represented employees as determined by the terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements funding for the defined benefit pension plans is based on a review of the specific requirements and an evaluation of the assets and liabilities of each plan funding for the companys matching and automatic contributions under the defined contribution plans is based on years of service plan compensation and amount of contributions by participants in addition to providing pension benefits the company provides certain health care benefits for retired employees funding for the retiree health care benefits occurs as claims or premiums are paid the determination of the obligation and expense for the companys defined benefit retirement pension plan and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the companys selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts those assumptions are described in the companys annual report on form k and include among other things the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other post retirement obligations and future expense the company did not make any contributions to its company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in the first quarter of we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans in contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions the company expects that any contributions made during will reduce its minimum required contributions in future years among other things investment performance of plan assets the interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations and future changes in legislation will determine the amounts of any additional contributions in addition the company expects its cash contributions and expense to the k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in compared to the company also contributes to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of its collective bargaining agreements these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans based on the most recent information available to it the company believes that the present value of actuarial accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits because the company is one of a number of employers contributing to these plans it is difficult to ascertain what the companys share of the underfunding would be although we anticipate the companys contributions to these plans will increase each year the company believes that levels of underfunding have not changed significantly since year end as a result the company expects meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years to reduce this underfunding moreover if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds the company could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably determined x details name kr
