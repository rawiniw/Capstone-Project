shareholder of kroger urges you to vote for proposal at the annual meeting of kroger shareholders on june proposal calls on kroger to have an independent chair of the board of directors we believe a structure where the ceo runs the business and is accountable to a board led by an independent chair is in the best interests of kroger shareholders except for brief apprenticeship periods at the outset of their ceo service kroger ceos have also held the role of board chair for many decades kroger ceo w rodney mcmullen is both the ceo and board chair we believe that independent oversight of management would improve the ability of the kroger board to support kroger executives as they formulate appropriate responses to sustainability and competitive challenges as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss an independent board chair is a corporate governance best practice supported by the council of institutional investors gmi ratings glass lewis and other corporate governance advisors according to spencer stuart of companies in the sp separated the roles of ceo and board chair in ceos that report to a board run by an independent chair are paid about less than their peers according to a study by proxy advisory firm institutional shareholder services we view ceo compensation as a visible indicator of the robustness of board oversight investors look to the board to advance a long term outlook as a counterweight to the shorter term approaches of traders and company management robust board oversight with a long term orientation is especially important as kroger competes with retailers which have implemented sustainability policies that may be more attractive to customers a march study rated kroger as failing on the category of pesticides in its supply chain because it has no publicly available policy to reduce or eliminate hazardous pesticide use while five of its leading competitors rated higher in this category fifty percent of americans report being concerned about chemicals in their food and percent are concerned about pesticide residues consumers cite avoiding pesticides and protecting the health of themselves and their children as the top two reasons to purchase organic in a recent natural grocers survey percent of organic consumers said they choose organic food to avoid pesticides

reputational and supply chain risks for failing to address the overuse of agricultural pesticides such as neonicotinoids glyphosate and chlorpyrifos a new report by the cambridge conservation initiative found that a dramatic decline in the number of pollinators such as bees and butterflies could lead to many companies facing potential shortages of raw materials a fall in crop quality and challenges around security of supply because of an emerging pollination deficit one of the leading factors contributing to pollinator decline is pesticide use a growing body of science has implicated the worlds most widely used insecticides neonicotinoids neonics used on crops as a key factor in recent declines of pollinators the task force on systemic pesticides a global body of independent scientists analyzed thousands of studies and concluded that neonicotinoids represent a major worldwide threat to biodiversity and ecosystems and called for an immediate stop to agricultural uses of systemic pesticides chlorpyrifos is a toxic nerve agent pesticide proven to cause health impacts in people including brain damage in children it has also been shown to harm pollinators and other wildlife people come in contact with the chemical through residues on food chlorpyrifos is so dangerous that after years of study the epa planned to ban this pesticide however that decision was reversed by epa administrator scott pruitt the science is clear that chlorpyrifos is unsafe and kroger should stop selling food grown with this pesticide we believe that the issue of sustainability and brand damage related to pesticide use is only one of many areas where independent oversight of kroger management by a board of directors chaired by an independent director would benefit the long
