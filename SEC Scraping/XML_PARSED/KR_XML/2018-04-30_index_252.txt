carriers but these amounts are not included in the totals referenced above as the amounts were paid over to insurance carriers for services provided by those carriers neither the compensation committee nor the board expressly approved the other services provided by mercer after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the compensation committee determined that the mercer consultant was independent and mercers work has not raised any conflict of interest because the mercer consultant was first engaged by the compensation committee before he became associated with mercer the mercer consultant works exclusively for the compensation committee and not for our management the mercer consultant does not benefit from the other work that mercers parent and affiliated companies perform for kroger and neither the mercer consultant nor the mercer consultants team perform any other services for kroger in july the committee invited proposals from other executive compensation consulting firms following consideration of several firms in december the committee engaged korn ferry hay group korn ferry as its executive compensation consultant due to the timing of the engagement korn ferry did not have an opportunity to assist the committee with the design and development of the executive compensation programs for fiscal other than assisting in the final determination of fiscal payouts after taking into consideration the nyses independence standards and the sec rules the compensation committee determined that the korn ferry consultant was independent and korn ferrys work has not raised any conflict of interest the compensation committee may engage an additional compensation consultant from time to time as it deems advisable compensation committee interlocks and insider participation no member of the compensation committee was an officer or employee of kroger during fiscal and no member of the compensation committee is a former officer of kroger or was a party to any related person transaction involving kroger required to be disclosed under item of regulation s k during fiscal none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers serving as a member of krogers board of directors or compensation committee of the board board oversight of enterprise risk while risk management is primarily the responsibility of krogers management team the board is responsible for strategic planning and overall supervision of our risk management activities the boards oversight of the material risks faced by kroger occurs at both the full board level and at the committee level the board receives presentations throughout the year from various department and business unit leaders that include discussion of significant risks as necessary at each board meeting the chairman and ceo addresses matters of particular importance or concern including any significant areas of risk that require board attention additionally through dedicated sessions focusing entirely on corporate strategy the full board reviews in detail krogers short and long term strategies including consideration of significant risks facing kroger and their potential impact the independent directors in executive sessions led by the lead director address matters of particular concern including significant areas of risk that warrant further discussion or consideration outside the presence of kroger employees at the committee level reports are given by management subject matter experts to each committee on risks within the scope of their charters the audit committee has oversight responsibility not only for financial reporting of krogers major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures but also for the effectiveness of managements processes that monitor and manage key business risks facing kroger as well as the major areas of risk exposure and managements efforts to monitor and control the major areas of risk exposure including cybersecurity risk the audit committee incorporates its risk oversight function into its regular reports to the board and also discusses with management its policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management management provides regular updates throughout the year to the respective board committees regarding management of the risks they oversee for example our vice president chief ethics and compliance officer provides regular updates to the audit committee on our compliance risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk and our executive vice president and chief information officer and our chief information security officer provide regular updates on our cybersecurity risks and actions taken to mitigate that risk to the audit committee the audit committee reports on risk to the full board at each regular meeting of the board we believe that our approach to risk oversight as described above optimizes our ability to assess inter relationships among the various risks make informed cost benefit decisions and approach emerging risks in a proactive manner for kroger we also believe that our risk structure complements our current board leadership structure as it allows our independent directors through the five fully independent board committees and in executive sessions of independent directors led by the lead director to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management led by mr mcmullen as chairman and

aheadrealignment of performance based pay to restock kroger for and beyond restock kroger in october we announced restock kroger our plan to redefine the food and grocery customer experience in america and to create value for our shareholders we developed the plan because though we are proud of our long history of success and our strengths we recognize that what got us here will not get us where we want to be in the future restock kroger has four main drivers redefine the food and grocery customer experience focus on data and personalization digital space optimization our brands and smart pricing expand partnerships to create customer value focus on front end transformation technology innovation cost reduction and alternative revenue streams develop talent accelerate high performance leadership culture through future talent development training and a rebalancing of pay and benefits live krogers purpose meet zero hunger zero waste targets and achieve sustainability goals the three year restock kroger plan is fueled by capital investments cost savings and free cash flow as a result of our plan over the next three years we expect to generate million in incremental fifo operating profit and billion of free cash flow before dividends double the performance of the previous three years we have prioritized our estimated billion in capital investments to support restock kroger over the next three years we are looking first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities across both brick and mortar and digital platforms followed by investments in logistics and technology platforms and finally capital for storing activity our compensation committee is focused on pay for performance the compensation committee has long maintained a strong pay for performance philosophy compensation must align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders and must create incentives to achieve the annual business plan targets and longer term company objectives we implemented a long term performance based bonus program for neos more than ten years ago and the metrics were tailored to our long term measures at that time as our business objectives have shifted the compensation committee is focused on ensuring performance metrics are aligned with our long term strategy our long term compensation program align with restock kroger we have made new commitments to shareholders on a three year time horizon under restock kroger we believe that the success of restock kroger depends on the focused attention of our leadership team and associates on the goals of restock kroger and that it is essential to implement new performance metrics that mirror these new commitments we are describing our approach for developing our ltip program even though it is still a work in progress to be transparent about how we are planning to make changes to our program to align with restock kroger our three year long term plan will have performance metrics tied to restock kroger goals free cash flow and cost savings included in fifo operating profit growth with a return on for important risk uncertainties and other factors relating to these forward looking statements see the risk factors in our annual report on form k that accompanies this proxy statement invested capital modifier we are implementing a metric based on the cost savings imbedded in the achievement of operating profit growth because cost savings is essential to fund the strategic projects that will produce the operating profit growth we believe it is a more meaningful metric than operating profit growth itself because it forces us to focus on the savings that we need to support sustainable incremental operating profit growth since we grant a new three year long term incentive plan each year at any one time there are three outstanding plans as we are mid cycle in the and long term plans we feel strongly that we should focus on restock kroger metrics rather than having competing priorities as a result the compensation committee has determined that the metrics of the mid cycle plans should be modified to align with restock kroger for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year and performance will be measured on the existing plan metrics and will be applied to two thirds of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts fiscal year performance will be measured on the restock kroger metrics of free cash flow and savings included in fifo operating profit growth and will be applied to one third of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts similarly for the outstanding long term plan fiscal year performance will be measured on the existing plan metrics and will be applied to one third of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts fiscal year and performance will be measured on the restock kroger metrics of free cash flow and cost savings included in fifo operating profit growth and will be applied to two thirds of the previously granted cash and performance unit bonus target amounts we are not adjusting cash bonus potentials or re issuing previously issued performance unit grants and we are not allowing neos to re earn cash and performance units that were not earned in the completed year s of the outstanding plans we did not change the timing of the payout under the outstanding plans these plan updates are illustrated below our annual cash bonus program based on meeting financial goals we have also redesigned the performance based annual cash bonus plan to better align with our financial goals of restock kroger and to simplify the way we reward our associates the annual plan has the following metrics id sales earnings per share strategic business plans that support restock kroger to further support the cost saving focus of restock kroger for any payout under the strategic business plans metric the company must have met its cost savings goals for our compensation philosophy and objectives as one of the largest retailers in the world our executive compensation philosophy is to attract and retain the best management talent as well as motivate these employees to achieve our business and financial goals krogers incentive plans are designed to reward the actions that lead to long term value creation the compensation committee believes that there is a strong link between our business strategy the performance metrics in our short term and long term incentive programs and the business results that drive shareholder value we believe our strategy creates value for shareholders in a manner consistent with our core values honesty integrity respect inclusion diversity and safety to achieve our objectives the compensation committee seeks to ensure that compensation is competitive and that there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so it is guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an neos level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance including both a short and long term focus compensation policies should include an opportunity for and a requirement of equity ownership to align the interests of neos and shareholders components of compensation should be tied to an evaluation of business and individual performance measured against metrics that directly drive our business strategy the compensation committee has three related objectives regarding compensation first the compensation committee believes that compensation must be designed to attract and retain those individuals who are best suited to be an officer at kroger second a majority of compensation should help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders third compensation should create strong incentives for the neos to achieve the annual business plan targets established by the board and to achieve krogers long term strategic objectives components of executive compensation at kroger compensation for our neos is comprised of the following annual compensation salary performance based annual cash bonus long term compensation performance based long term incentive plan consisting of a long term cash bonus and performance units non qualified stock options restricted stock retirement and other benefits limited perquisites the annual and long term performance based compensation awards described herein were made pursuant to our long term incentive and cash bonus plan which was approved by our shareholders in annual compensationsalary our philosophy with respect to salary is to provide a sufficient and stable source of fixed cash compensation all of our compensation cannot be at risk or long term it is important to provide a meaningful annual salary to attract and retain a high caliber leadership team and to have an appropriate level of cash compensation that is not variable salaries for the neos with the exception of the ceo are established each year by the compensation committee in consultation with the ceo the ceos salary is established by all of the independent directors salaries for the neos are reviewed annually in june the amount of each neos salary is influenced by numerous factors including an assessment of individual contribution in the judgment of the ceo and the compensation committee or in the case of the ceo of the compensation committee and the independent directors benchmarking with comparable positions at peer group companies tenure in role and relationship to other kroger executives salaries the assessment of individual contribution is a qualitative determination based on the following factors leadership contribution to the officer group achievement of established objectives decision making abilities performance of the areas or groups directly reporting to the neo increased responsibilities strategic thinking and furtherance of krogers core values annual compensationperformance based annual cash bonus the neos participate in a performance based annual cash bonus plan the amount of annual cash bonus that the neos earn each year is based upon krogers performance compared to goals established by the compensation committee and the independent directors based on the business plan adopted by the board of directors a minimum level of performance must be achieved before any payouts are earned while a payout of up to of target bonus potential can be achieved for superior performance there are no guaranteed or minimum payouts if none of the performance goals are achieved then none of the bonus is earned and no payout is made the annual cash bonus plan is designed to encourage decisions and behavior that drive the annual operating results and the long term success of the company krogers success is based on a combination of factors and accordingly the compensation committee believes that it is important to encourage behavior that supports multiple elements of our business strategy establishing annual cash bonus potentials the compensation committee establishes annual cash bonus potentials for each neo other than the ceo whose annual cash bonus potential is established by the independent directors actual payouts represent the extent to which performance meets or exceeds the goals established by the compensation committee actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the goals established by the compensation committee or as high as of the potential bonus amount if the performance far exceeds these pre established goals the compensation committee considers multiple factors in making its determination or recommendation as to annual cash bonus potentials the individuals level within the organization as the compensation committee believes that more senior executives should have a more substantial part of their compensation dependent upon krogers performance the individuals salary as the compensation committee believes that a significant portion of an neos total cash compensation should be dependent upon krogers performance the individuals level in the organization and the internal relationship of annual cash bonus potentials within kroger individual performance the recommendation of the ceo for the other neos and the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding annual cash bonus potential and total compensation awarded by our peer group annual cash bonus plan metrics the annual cash bonus plan had the following measurable performance metrics all of which are interconnected metric weight rationale for use id sales id sales represent sales without fuel at our supermarkets that have been open without expansion or relocation for five full quarters we believe this is the best measure of the real growth of our sales across the enterprise a key driver of our model is strong id sales it is the engine that fuels our growth net operating profit without supermarket fuel operating profit net operating profit net operating profit allows us to evaluate our earnings from operating the business we cannot achieve solid net operating profit without a strong operating model this is a good measure of the profitability of the business which takes into account the capital invested to generate the earnings customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four keys of our customer st strategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric includes a mixture of strategic and operational metrics that measure the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys annual cash bonus payout is based on certain elements of the customer st strategy to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year total of metrics clicklist bonus kicker an additional is earned if kroger achieves certain goals with respect to our clicklist expansion and operations the clicklist bonus is included in the annual cash bonus plan as an incentive to encourage the addition of clicklist locations at a faster rate while maintaining certain operating and financial standards the clicklist bonus of is only available if the pre determined measures are met if any of the goals are not met no portion of the clicklist bonus is earned net operating profit is calculated as gross profit minus operating general and administrative expenses minus depreciation and amortization excluding supermarket fuel and the non kroger portion of earnings of consolidated variable interest entities results of annual cash bonus plan the goals established by the compensation committee the actual results and the bonus percentage earned for each of the performance metrics of the annual cash bonus plan were as follows goals actual performance compared to minimumgoal a amountearned a x b performance metrics minimum target actualperformance weight b id sales net operating profit billion billion billion customer st strategy clicklist bonus or total earned the customer st strategy goal also was established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but is not disclosed as it is competitively sensitive an additional would have been earned if kroger had achieved certain goals with respect to its clicklist expansion and operation these goals were established by the compensation committee at the beginning of the year but are not disclosed as they are competitively sensitive following the close of the year the compensation committee reviewed krogers performance against each of the metrics outlined above and determined the extent to which kroger achieved those objectives due to our performance when compared to the goals established by the compensation committee the neos earned of their bonus potentials in as in all years the compensation committee retained discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus payout for all executive officers including the neos if the compensation committee determined for any reason that the bonus payouts were not appropriate given their assessment of company performancehowever no adjustments were made in that affected neo bonuses the independent directors retained that discretion for the ceos bonus the compensation committee and the independent directors also retained discretion to adjust the goals for each metric under the plan should unanticipated developments arise during the year the actual annual cash bonus percentage payout for represented performance that did not meet many of our business plan objectives the strong link between pay and performance is illustrated by a comparison of earned amounts under our annual cash bonus plan in previous years such as and when payouts significantly exceeded in those years we achieved and or exceeded many of our business plan objectives a comparison of actual annual cash bonus percentage payouts this year and in prior years demonstrates the variability of annual cash bonus incentive compensation and its strong link to our performance fiscal year annual cash bonus payout percentage as described above the annual cash bonus payout percentage is applied to each neos bonus potential which is determined by the compensation committee and the independent directors in the case of the ceo the actual amounts of performance based annual cash bonuses paid to the neos for are reported in the summary compensation table in the non equity incentive plan compensation column and footnote to that table long term compensation the compensation committee believes in the importance of providing an incentive to the neos to achieve the long term goals established by the board as such a majority of compensation is conditioned on the achievement of the companys long term goals and is delivered via four long term compensation vehicles long term cash bonus performance units stock options and restricted stock long term compensation promotes long term value creation and discourages the over emphasis of attaining short term goals at the expense of long term growth the compensation committee considers several factors in determining the target value of long term compensation awarded to the neos or in the case of the ceo recommending to the independent directors the amount awarded these factors include individual performance the neos level in the organization and the internal relationship of long term compensation awards within kroger the compensation consultants benchmarking report regarding long term compensation awarded by our peer group and the recommendation of the ceo for the other neos long term incentives are structured to be a combination of performance and time based compensation that reflects elements of financial and common shares performance to provide both retention value and alignment with company performance long term cash bonus and performance unit payouts are contingent on the achievement of certain strategic performance and financial measures and incentivize recipients to promote long term value creation and enhance shareholder wealth by supporting the companys long term strategic goals stock options and restricted stock are linked to common shares performance creating alignment between the neos and our shareholders interests options have no initial value and recipients only realize benefits if the value of our common shares increases following the date of grant a majority of long term compensation is equity based performance units stock options and restricted stock and is tied to the future value of our common shares further aligning the interests of our neos with our shareholders all four components of long term compensation are intended to focus executive behaviors on our long term strategy each component is described in more detail below amounts of long term compensation awards issued and outstanding for the neos are set forth in the executive compensation tables section long term incentive plan design in recent years we have adopted a similar long term incentive plan each year which provides for overlapping three year performance periods the long term incentive plans adopted in and which consist of a performance based long term cash bonus and performance units have the following characteristics the long term cash bonus potential is equal to the participants salary at the end of the fiscal year preceding the plan effective date or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan in addition a fixed number of performance units is awarded to each participant at the beginning of the performance period or for those participants entering the plan after the commencement date the date of eligibility for the plan the earned awards are paid out in kroger common shares based on actual performance along with a cash amount equal to the dividends paid during the performance period on the number of issued common shares ultimately earned the actual long term cash bonus and number of performance units earned are each determined based on our performance against the metrics established by the compensation committee the independent directors for the ceo at the beginning of the performance period performance at the end of the three year period is measured against the baseline of each performance metric established at the beginning of the performance period the payout percentage based on the extent to which the performance metrics are achieved is applied to both the long term cash bonus potential and the number of performance units awarded actual payouts cannot exceed of the long term cash bonus potential or of the number of performance units awarded the compensation committee anticipates adopting a new long term incentive plan each year measuring improvement over successive three year periods each year when establishing the performance metric baselines and percentage payouts per unit of improvement the compensation committee considers the difficulty of achieving compounded improvement over time long term incentive plan metrics the following table summarizes the long term incentive plans adopted in and metric rationale for use customer st strategy krogers customer st strategy is the focus in our decision making on the customer the four keys of our customer st strategy are people products shopping experience and price this proprietary metric measures the improvement in how kroger is perceived by customers in each of the four keys long term incentive plan payout is based on all of the elements of the customer st strategy to maintain our top executives consistent focus on the entirety of the customer st strategy this is in contrast to the annual cash bonus payout which is based on certain elements of the customer st strategy to highlight annual objectives that are intended to receive the most focused attention in that year improvement in associateengagement kroger measures associate engagement in an annual survey of associates this metric is included in these long term incentive plans as an acknowledgement that our companys success is directly tied to our associates connecting with and serving our customers every day whether in our stores manufacturing plants distribution centers or offices reduction in operatingcosts as a percentage ofsales without fuel an essential part of krogers model is to increase productivity and efficiency and to take costs out of the business in a sustainable way we strive to be disciplined so that as the company grows expenses are properly managed including this metric in these long term incentive plans provides an incentive to implement policies for sustainable improvement over a long period of time roic part of our long term growth strategy is to make substantial capital investments over time we have a pipeline of high quality projects with significant capital spend it is essential that we achieve the proper returns on our investments this measure is intended to hold executives accountable for the returns on the capital investments operating costs is a non gaap measure and is calculated as the sum of i operating general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization and rent expense without fuel and ii warehouse and transportation costs shrink and advertising expenses for our supermarket operations without fuel operating costs will exclude one time expenses incurred in lieu of future anticipated obligations future expenses that are avoided by virtue of the incurrence of the one time expense will be deemed to be total operating costs in the year in which they otherwise would have been incurred return on invested capital is a non gaap measure and is calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit for the prior four quarters by the average invested capital adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit and adding our last in first out lifo charge depreciation and amortization and rent average invested capital will be calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets ii the average lifo reserve iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight minus i the average taxes receivable ii the average trade accounts payable iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities

retirement plans for its employees the neos participate in one or more of these plans as well as one or more excess plans designed to make up the shortfall in retirement benefits created by limitations under the internal revenue code the code on benefits to highly compensated individuals under qualified plans additional details regarding certain retirement benefits available to the neos can be found below in footnote to the summary compensation table and the pension benefits table and the accompanying narrative kroger also maintains an executive deferred compensation plan in which some of the neos participate this plan is a nonqualified plan under which participants can elect to defer up to of their cash compensation each year additional details regarding our nonqualified deferred compensation plans available to the neos can be found below in the nonqualified deferred compensation table and the accompanying narrative kroger also maintains the kroger co employee protection plan kepp which covers all of our management employees who are classified as exempt under the federal fair labor standards act and certain administrative or technical support personnel who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement with at least one year of service kepp provides for severance benefits and extended kroger paid health care as well as the continuation of other

in control as described in the grant agreements none of the neos is party to an employment agreement perquisites our neos receive limited perquisites because the compensation committee does not believe that it is necessary for the attraction or retention of management talent to provide executives a substantial amount of compensation in the form of perquisites in all of the neos received the following benefits premiums paid on life insurance policies premiums paid on accidental death and dismemberment insurance and premiums paid on long term disability insurance policies in mr aitken received reimbursement of tax preparation fees and cell phone fees further details on these benefits can be found in footnote to the summary compensation table process for establishing executive compensation the compensation committee of the board has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation of our executive officers including the neos with the exception of the ceo the compensation committees role regarding the ceos compensation is to make recommendations to the independent members of the board those members of the board establish the ceos compensation the compensation committee directly engaged a compensation consultant from mercer to advise the compensation committee in the design of compensation for executive officers through the compensation planning cycle the mercer consultant conducted an annual competitive assessment of executive positions at kroger for the compensation committee the assessment is one of several bases as described above on which the compensation committee determines compensation the consultant assessed base salary target performance based annual cash bonus target annual cash compensation the sum of salary and annual cash bonus potential annualized long term compensation such as performance based long term cash bonus potential and performance units stock options and restricted stock and total direct compensation the sum of target annual cash compensation and annualized long term compensation in addition to the factors identified above the consultant also reviewed actual payout amounts against the targeted amounts the consultant compared these elements against those of other companies in a group of publicly traded companies selected by the compensation committee for our peer group consisted of best buy home depot target cardinal health johnson johnson tjx companies costco wholesale lowes wal mart cvs health procter gamble walgreens boots alliance express scripts sysco the make up of the compensation peer group is reviewed annually and modified as circumstances warrant the compensation committee modified the peer group in because of industry consolidation and other competitive forces previously the compensation committee used a primary peer group consisting only of food and drug retailers in addition the compensation committee considered data from general industry companies provided by its independent compensation consultant a representation of major publicly traded companies of similar size and scope from outside the retail industry this data provided reference points particularly for senior executive positions where competition for talent extends beyond the retail sector the new peer group includes a combination of food and drug retailers other large retailers based on revenue size and large consumer facing companies median revenue for the peer group was billion compared to our revenue of billion considering the size of kroger in relation to other peer group companies the compensation committee believes that salaries paid to our neos should be competitively positioned relative to amounts paid by peer group companies for comparable positions the compensation committee also aims to provide an annual cash bonus potential to our neos that if achieved at superior levels would cause total cash compensation to be meaningfully above the median actual payouts may be as low as zero if performance does not meet the baselines established by the compensation committee the independent members of the board have the exclusive authority to determine the amount of the ceos compensation in setting total compensation the independent directors consider the median compensation of the peer groups ceos with respect to the annual bonus the independent directors make two determinations they determine the annual cash bonus potential that will be multiplied by the annual cash bonus payout percentage earned that is applicable to the neos and the independent directors determine the annual cash bonus amount paid to the ceo by retaining discretion to reduce the annual cash bonus percentage payout the ceo would otherwise receive under the formulaic plan the compensation committee performs the same function and exercises the same authority as to the other neos in its annual review of compensation for the neos the compensation committee conducts an annual review of all components of compensation quantifying total compensation for the neos on tally sheets the review includes a summary for each neo of salary performance based annual cash bonus long term performance based cash and performance unit compensation stock options restricted stock accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains and restricted stock and performance unit values the value of any perquisites retirement benefits company paid health and welfare benefits banked vacation severance benefits available under kepp and earnings and payouts available under krogers nonqualified deferred compensation program considers internal pay equity at kroger to ensure that the ceo is not compensated disproportionately the compensation committee has determined that the compensation of the ceo and that of the other neos bears a reasonable relationship to the compensation levels of other executive positions at kroger taking into consideration performance and differences in responsibilities reviews a report from the compensation committees compensation consultant comparing neo and other senior executive compensation with that of other companies including both our peer group of competitors and a larger general industry group to ensure that the compensation committees objectives of competitiveness are met takes into account a recommendation from the ceo except in the case of his own compensation for salary annual cash bonus potential and long term compensation awards for each of the senior officers including the other neos the ceos recommendation takes into consideration the objectives established by and the reports received by the compensation committee as well as his assessment of individual job performance and contribution to our management team the compensation committee does not make use of a formula but both qualitatively and quantitatively considers each of the factors identified above in setting compensation advisory vote to approve executive compensation at the annual meeting we held our seventh annual advisory vote on executive compensation over of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote in the compensation committee believes it conveys our shareholders support of the compensation committees decisions and the existing executive compensation programs the compensation committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation programs for or our pay for performance philosophy at the annual meeting we held an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation approximately of the votes cast were in favor of an annual vote and accordingly we will continue to have an annual advisory vote stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our officers and directors with your interests as shareholders the board has adopted stock ownership guidelines these guidelines require non employee directors executive officers and other key executives to acquire and hold a minimum dollar value of kroger common shares as set forth below position multiple chief executive officer times base salary president and chief operating officer times base salary executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents times base salary group vice presidents division presidents and other designated key executives times base salary non employee directors

necessary to pay the exercise price of the options and or applicable taxes and must retain all kroger common shares unless the disposition is approved in advance by the ceo or by the board or compensation committee for the ceo executive compensation recoupment policy clawback if a material error of facts results in the payment to an executive officer at the level of group vice president or higher of an annual cash bonus or a long term cash bonus in an amount higher than otherwise would have been paid as determined by the compensation committee then the officer upon demand from the compensation committee will reimburse kroger for the amounts that would not have been paid if the error had not occurred this recoupment policy applies to those amounts paid by kroger within months prior to the detection and public disclosure of the error in enforcing the policy the compensation committee will take into consideration all factors that it deems appropriate including the materiality of the amount of payment involved the extent to which other benefits were reduced in other years as a result of the achievement of performance levels based on the error individual officer culpability if any and other factors that should offset the amount of overpayment compensation policies as they relate to risk management as part of the compensation committees review of our compensation practices the compensation committee considers and analyzes the extent to which risks arise from such practices and their impact on krogers business as discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis our policies and practices for compensating employees are designed to among other things attract and retain high quality and engaged employees in this process the compensation committee also focuses on minimizing risk through the implementation of certain practices and policies such as the executive compensation recoupment policy which is described above under executive compensation recoupment policy clawback accordingly we do not believe that our compensation practices and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on kroger prohibition on hedging and pledging after considering best practices related to ownership of company shares the board has adopted a policy prohibiting kroger directors and executive officers from engaging directly or indirectly in the pledging of hedging transactions in or short sales of kroger securities section m of the internal revenue code prior to the effective date of the tax cuts and jobs act of section m of the code generally disallowed a federal tax deduction to public companies for compensation greater than million paid in any tax year to specified executive officers unless the compensation was qualified performance based compensation under that section pursuant to the tax cuts and jobs act of the exception for qualified performance based compensation under section m of the code was eliminated with respect to all remuneration in excess of million other than qualified performance based compensation pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on november or earlier which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date the legislation providing for such transition rule the transition rule as a result performance based compensation that the compensation committee structured in previous years with the intent of qualifying as performance based compensation under section m that will be paid after january may not be fully deductible depending on the application of the transition rule the committee willconsistent with its past practicecontinue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long term interests of the company and our shareholders with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account compensation committee report the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with krogers management the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this proxy statement based on its review and discussions with management the compensation

annual total compensation of our chairman and ceo mr mcmullen to the annual total compensation of our median employee as reported in the summary compensation table our ceo had annual total compensation for of using this summary compensation table methodology the annual total compensation of our median employee for was as a result we estimate that the ratio of our ceos annual total compensation to that of our median employee for fiscal was to this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with sec rules based on our payroll records and the methodology described below the sec rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employees annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices as such other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies exclusions estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios therefore the estimated pay ratio reported above may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies and should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies we identify the median employee from our employee population on the last day of our th fiscal period december which included full time part time temporary and seasonal employees who were employed on that date the consistently applied compensation measure we used was base salary wages paid which we measured from the beginning of our fiscal year january through december and we multiplied the average weekly earnings during this period of each full time and part time permanent employee by which was the number of weeks in fiscal we annualized the earnings of all permanent employees who were on a leave of absence or were new hires in we did not make any other adjustments permissible by the sec nor did we make any other material assumptions or estimates to identify our median employee once the median employee was identified we then determined the median employees annual total compensation using the summary compensation table methodology as detailed in item c x of regulation s k and compared it to the annual total compensation of mr mcmullen as detailed in the total column of the summary compensation table for to arrive at the pay ratio disclosed above itemno advisory vote to approve executive compensation you are being asked to vote on an

there is a direct link between pay and performance to do so we are guided by the following principles a significant portion of pay should be performance based with the percentage of total pay tied to performance increasing proportionally with an executives level of responsibility compensation should include incentive based pay to drive performance providing superior pay for superior performance

itemno vote to approve amendment to regulations to permit board amendments in accordance with ohio law under this item no we are asking our shareholders to approve an amendment to our regulations allowing the board of directors to adopt amendments to the regulations to the extent permitted by ohio law our regulations currently require our shareholders to adopt all amendments the text of the revised article vii of our regulations with the additional text proposed by the amendment indicated by underlining is set forth below the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the proposed text of the amendment below like many ohio companies whose shareholders have voted to amend their regulations to permit amendments by their boards of directors we are asking our shareholders to approve proposal no in light of the following many jurisdictions such as delaware have historically allowed the directors of a corporation to amend the corporations bylaws the delaware equivalent of ohios regulations without shareholder approval since ohio law provides ohio corporations with flexibility similar to delaware corporations to make certain amendments to their regulations without shareholder approval if the authority is provided in the corporations articles of incorporation or regulations subject to statutory limitations that prohibit directors from amending the regulations in a way that affects important rights that ohio law reserves for shareholders giving this flexibility to our board of directors would enable them to efficiently and cost effectively streamline and improve the regulations as needed in the future and also to quickly adapt them to changes in state law or governance trends such as adopting modern provisions regarding electronic notice and actions even if proposal is approved the boards ability to amend the regulations will be limited under ohio law only our shareholders would be able to make the following amendments to our regulations changing the percentage of common shares needed to call a special shareholders meeting changing the length of the time period required for notice of shareholders meetings changing the requirement for a quorum at shareholders meetings prohibiting shareholder or director actions from being authorized or taken without a meeting defining terms of office for directors or providing for classification of directors requiring greater than a majority vote of shareholders to remove directors without cause changing the requirements for a quorum at directors meetings or the required vote for an action of the directors or including a requirement that a control share acquisition of the corporation be approved by the corporations shareholders accordingly if shareholders approve proposal article vii of our regulations would be revised to allow the board of directors to amend our regulations in the future to the extent permitted by ohio law which authority could not be delegated to a committee of the board of directors and the board would be able to amend repeal and adopt new regulations to implement ministerial and other changes to our regulations other than with respect to the matters reserved for shareholders under ohio law including as set forth above without the time consuming and expensive process of seeking shareholder approval the amendment also clarifies that the power to amend the regulations whether exercised by the board or shareholders includes the power to adopt new regulations if proposal is approved we would promptly notify shareholders of any amendments to our regulations made by the board of directors either by filing a report with the sec or by sending a notice to shareholders of record as of the date of the adoption of the amendment our shareholders would continue to be able to adopt amend and repeal the regulations without action by the board and therefore to change any amendment made by the board of directors should they determine that to be appropriate the actual text of the revised article vii of our regulations with changes indicated by underlining is set forth below the amendment would become effective at the time of the shareholder vote article vii amendment of regulations these regulations may be amendedor repealedor new regulations may be adopted a at any meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose or without such meeting by the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power on such proposal except that the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise of the voting power on such proposal shall be required to amend alter change or repeal sections or of article ii or this article vii or to amend alter change or repeal these regulations in any way inconsistent with the intent of the foregoing provisions or b by the board of directors to the extent permitted by the ohio

packaging is unrecyclable including plastics which are a growing component of plastic pollution and marine litter authorities say that marine litter kills and injures marine life spreads toxics and poses a potential threat to human health the environmental cost of consumer plastic products and packaging exceeds billion annually according to the american chemistry council plastic is the fastest growing form of packaging u s flexible plastic sales are estimated at billion dried fruit frozen meat cheese and dog food are some of the kroger house brand items packaged in unrecyclable plastic pouches private label items account for a quarter of all salesnearly billion annually using unrecyclable packaging when recyclable alternatives are available wastes valuable resources william mcdonough a leading green design advisor calls pouch packaging a monstrous hybrid designed to end up either in a landfill or incinerator recyclability of household packaging is a growing area of focus as consumers become more environmentally conscious yet recycling rates stagnate only of plastic packaging is recycled according to the u s environmental protection agency epa billions of pouches and similar multi layer plastic laminates lie buried in landfills unrecyclable packaging is more likely to be littered and swept into waterways an assessment of marine debris by the global environment facility concluded that one cause of debris entering oceans is design and marketing of products internationally without appropriate regard to their environmental fate or ability to be recycled in the marine environment plastics break down into indigestible particles that marine life mistake for food studies by the epa suggest a synergistic effect between plastic debris and persistent bio accumulative toxic chemicals plastics absorb toxics such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins from water or sediment and transfer them to the marine food web and potentially to human diets if no actions are taken oceans are expected to contain more plastic than fish by making all packaging recyclable if possible is the first step needed to reduce the threat posed by plastic pollution better management of plastic could save consumer goods companies billion a year companies who aspire to corporate sustainability yet use these risky materials need to explain why they use unrecyclable packaging other companies who manufacture and sell food and household goods are moving towards recyclability walmart uses sustainable packaging guidelines to incentivize its suppliers to increase the

that the board of directors issue a report at reasonable cost omitting confidential information assessing the environmental impacts of continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging supporting statement proponents believe that the report should include an assessment of the reputational financial and operational risks associated with continuing to use unrecyclable brand packaging and if possible goals and a timeline to phase out unrecyclable packaging the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger recognizes the important role our company plays as a good steward of the environment including efforts to reduce packaging and increase recyclability we focus on reducing waste through our commitment to be a zero waste company diverting at least of waste from landfills by as of kroger had diverted more than of its waste and as part of our zero hunger i zero waste social impact plan to end hunger in our communities and eliminate waste across the company by in kroger announced its sustainability goals one of these goals specifically focuses on improvements in our brands packaging goal our brands packaging

produce to our stores using reusable plastic containers rpcs which improve product quality and significantly reduce waste by eliminating the use of cardboard boxes we continue to increase our volume of fresh produce shipped in rpcs and used million containers in advocacy we are actively engaging in industry collaboration groups and directly with our stakeholders on these topics to accelerate efforts to achieve our packaging goals kroger joined the sustainable packaging coalition in we believe our participation will accelerate our progress and help advance industry wide and supply chain wide initiatives to move the needle on recyclability and identify suppliers who can support our sustainable packaging goals guided by our sustainability goals and our zero hunger i zero waste social impact plan kroger will continue to support plastic waste reduction find optimized solutions for packaging and create opportunities for our associates and customers to recycle plastics in our stores we will continue to optimize our brands packaging in ways that support our financial environmental and social responsibilities to our customers shareholders and other stakeholders the proposal asks that kroger issue a report on unrecyclable packaging material kroger publishes details on our sustainability goals initiatives and progress against our targets in our sustainability report and on our website http sustainability kroger com given our extensive reporting and our strong focus on ensuring we are responsible stewards of the environment the board believes that issuing a report on unrecyclable packaging would be unnecessary and would consume time and resources that are best spent on executing on our sustainability programs and targets we urge you to support these efforts and vote against this proposal itemno shareholder proposalrenewable energy we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting whereas the long term interests of shareholders are best served by companies that operate their businesses in a sustainable manner focused on long term value creation this is particularly important in the context of climate change to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change global warming must be limited to under degrees celsius ipcc a goal consistent with the internationally recognized paris agreement kroger is one of the worlds largest food retailers exceeding billion in revenue it is listed th on fortunes fortune list and th on fortunes global list despite its size and significant carbon impact kroger lags behind its peers in establishing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets where most companies are reducing carbon krogers combined scope emissions have annually increased since kroger cdp reports investors are concerned that krogers globally significant carbon emissions are not being adequately addressed one meaningful way kroger could reduce its carbon footprint is to expand its use of renewable energy while making some inroads on energy and supply chain efficiency kroger has not instituted comprehensive programs to reduce the carbon impact of its power sourcing krogers failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy is in strong contrast to its peers which are rapidly and profitably scaling renewable energy competitor walmart installed mw of solar at different sites target developed mw

executive chairman of alphabet inc much of corporate america is buying renewable energy not just to be sustainable because it makes business sense helping companies diversify their power supply hedge against fuel risks and support innovation in an increasingly cost competitive way google green blog while kroger claims it is committed to reducing its carbon footprint it has yet to make meaningful commitments to shift its massive energy consumption away from fossil fuel sources accelerating renewable energy adoption will help kroger stay competitive and protect krogers shareholder value into the future as intensifying climate change imposes growing costs on krogers supply chain physical assets and shareholders resolved shareholders request kroger produce a report with board oversight assessing the climate change risk reduction benefits of adopting quantitative time bound enterprise wide targets for increasing its renewable energy sourcing the report should be produced at reasonable cost and exclude proprietary information supporting statement shareholders request the report also include discussion of the business risk kroger faces from climate change the potential for renewable energy procurement to reduce such risk and options for increasing renewable energy adoption the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons kroger is committed to environmental sustainability and we strive to reduce our impact on the environment by proactively reducing carbon emissions in our business over time we believe the concerns of the proponent are addressed by a number of initiatives including our sustainability goals and the commitments outlined in krogers zero hunger i zero waste social impact plan our vision to end hunger in the communities we call home and eliminate waste across our company by kroger has a history of reducing carbon emissions across our footprint through investments in energy efficiency renewable energy and refrigerant emissions reductions we continue to expand the implementation of existing solutions that have proven successful as well as identify and evaluate new technologies that have the potential to further improve sustainability as a result we have demonstrated a long term reduction trend in carbon emissions intensity metric tons co e per square foot across our company our commitments in kroger announced a set of sustainability goals http sustainability kroger com goals html we continue to make progress toward achieving these goals which include several goals to address carbon emissions reductions we will publish our annual sustainability report again this year to highlight key achievements and initiatives more information on krogers sustainability goals and zero hunger i zero waste can be found at www thekrogerco com the following is an overview of our key commitments and progress to date in emissions reductions goal kroger will reduce cumulative electricity consumption in our stores by by using as a baseline year kroger has shown long term success in reducing energy consumption through the maintenance of existing processes and technologies as well as testing and learning from new technologies in we installed new led lighting in more than stores and we will continue to retrofit remaining stores in we also participate in the u s epas energy star program and have more than energy star certified kroger operated stores to date we continue to pursue additional energy star certifications on an ongoing basis in fact we recently earned the energy star partner of the year award as a result of these efforts we made significant progress on our goal in goal kroger will improve transportation efficiency by by using as a baseline year our logistics team continues to track our ton miles per gallon tmpg which effectively looks at how many miles we haul one ton of groceries on one gallon of fuel by the end of we had achieved an improvement of due to ongoing evaluation of new technologies and increasing efficiencies in how we make deliveries and operate our equipment in addition kroger has committed to adding tesla semi electric trucks to its distribution fleet which require lower energy cost per mile in comparison to conventional diesel tractors goal kroger will reduce refrigerant leaks in our supermarket refrigeration systems by annually kroger continues to reduce refrigerant leaks in our stores and sets annual reduction targets through the epas greenchill program in we achieved our goal to further reduce refrigerant emissions by in our stores as a result of installing refrigerant leak protection systems and an active leak detection program we are committed to an additional reduction in goal kroger will be a zero waste company by or more of waste diverted away from landfills and eliminate food waste across our company by kroger previously committed to achieve zero waste across our company as part of our sustainability goals our current landfill diversion rate is greater than thanks to our manufacturing and logistics teamsboth above diversionand the success of our zero hunger i zero waste food rescue program as part of krogers commitment to zero hunger i zero waste we set a new industry leading goal to eliminate food waste across our company by as a food manufacturer and retailer the reduction of food waste is an important component of our scope emissionskey to reducing the production of methane one of the most potent greenhouse gases we are working with the world wildlife fund to assess our food waste impacts set goals to reduce waste and establish a framework for food waste reporting going forward innovative approaches kroger continues to evaluate and launch solar power installations at our facilities in we activated new solar power parking lot installations at three frys supermarket locations these combined solar power and shade technology projects generate renewable power for our stores as well as cover for our customers cars while they shop with us collectively our solar and wind power installations generated more than million kwh of power this past year in late kroger completed installation and activated a new anaerobic wastewater treatment facility at our kb specialty foods food production plant in greensburg indiana this anaerobic digestion process converts the wastewater into renewable biogas which is used to produce electricity when running at maximum capacity the digester can produce up to of the electricity needed to operate the kb specialty foods plant this is krogers second anaerobic digester the first is the kroger recovery system an anaerobic digester at the ralphs food less distribution center in compton california this facility began operations in late and is designed to process inedible food and other organic waste into renewable biogas and ultimately electricity as with the greensburg facility the compton digester can supply a portion of the distribution centers power needs looking ahead finally as part of our ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability we continue to evaluate the next steps in our carbon reduction strategy we continue to engage internal and external stakeholders in this discussion as well as benchmark other companies with leading carbon reduction targets and initiatives while we remain focused on achieving our and goals we are also reviewing the means and opportunities for further carbon emission reductions in the future the proposal asks that kroger issue a report on renewable energy kroger publishes details on our sustainability goals initiatives and progress against our targets in our sustainability report and on our website sustainability kroger com given our extensive reporting and our strong focus on ensuring we are responsible stewards of the environment the board believes that issuing a report on renewable energy would be unnecessary and would consume time and resources that are best spent on executing on our sustainability programs and targets we urge you to support the furthering of our current programs and vote against this proposal itemno shareholder proposalindependent chairman we have been notified by one shareholder the name and shareholdings of which will be furnished promptly to any shareholder upon written or oral request to krogers secretary at our executive offices that it intends to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting resolved shareowners of the kroger co kroger ask the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent member of the board this policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation the policy should provide that i if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the policy within days of that determination and ii compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair supporting statement except for brief apprenticeship periods at the outset of their ceo service kroger ceos have also held the role of board chair for many decades we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporations governance which can harm shareholder value as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and support strong board oversight proxy advisor glass lewis opined in a report that shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a ceo or other executive also serves as chairman www glasslewis com wp content uploads in depth report independent board chairman pdf an independent board chair has been found in academic studies to improve the performance of public companies although evidence overall is inconclusive while separating the roles of chair and ceo is the norm in europe of sp company boards have also implemented this best practice www spencerstuart comt media pdr files research and insight pdfs spencer stuart us board index pdf we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly useful at kroger in providing more robust oversight regarding sustainability issues we agree with the recent observations by state street global advisors ceo that a long term horizon requires a focus on sustainability and that boards are often better equipped than the day to day management to see these issues over longer time horizons www ssga com investment topics environmental social governance long term value be gins at the board eu pdf kroger continues to risk its reputation by selling produce treated with neonicotinoids a group of insecticides highly toxic to bees kroger has refused to join the fair food program to ensure equitable treatment of farm workers kroger also faces reputational risk associated with its responses to the impacts of food production on deforestation independent board leadership would we think more likely result in improved policies and practices to mitigate these business risks we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal the board of directors recommends a vote against this proposal for the following reasons the board should have the flexibility to determine the boards structure tailored to krogers needs at any time including separating or combining the roles of chairman and ceo krogers board is structured to provide the most effective leadership for our shareholders our shareholders interests are best served when the company retains the flexibility to select the appropriate person to serve in the chairmans role given the changing circumstances of the retail food marketplace the board believes that the proponents rigid one size fits all proposal is not in the best interest of shareholders and should be rejected kroger has a balanced governance structure in which independent directors including an independent lead director exercise meaningful and vigorous oversight krogers board is led by a strong independent lead director who serves the same functions as a chairman and provides the safeguards that the proposal seeks krogers independent lead director has robust responsibilities that ensure a strong independent and active board that complements the chairmans role the lead directors robust duties and responsibilities are addressed in detail in the guidelines which are available at ir kroger com the lead director serves a variety of roles including reviewing and approving all board meeting agendas meeting materials and schedule serving as a liaison between the chairman and the independent directors presiding at the regularly conducted executive sessions of independent directors and meetings of the board when the chairman is not present calling an executive session of the independent directors at any time and serving as the boards representative for any consultation and direct communication if requested by major shareholders while our current chairman is also the ceo this structure is a reflection of the boards current view that both kroger and our shareholders would not be best served by separation the roles at this time given the important skills and industry expertise that our ceo brings to the board particularly given krogers current transformation under the restock kroger plan however the board routinely reviews krogers leadership structure which includes a discussion of krogers performance the impact that the leadership has on that performance and the structure that best serves the interests of shareholders our strong governance practices ensure our boards independent leadership and oversight the board has instituted structures and practices in addition to the independent lead director that create a balanced governance system of independent and effective oversight including all of krogers board members are independent except for the ceo all members including chairpersons of each of the board committees are independent the full board of independent directors annually evaluate the ceos performance led by the independent lead director the full board and each committee performs annual self assessments the board is committed to board refreshment and diversity and the board and each of its committees have unfettered access to management and the authority to retain independent advisors as they deem appropriate contrary to the assertions in the proponents supporting statement there is no established consensus that separating the roles of the chairman and the ceo is a best practice or that such a separation enhances returns for shareholders the authors of a wharton school of business article entitled splitting up the roles of ceo and chairman reform or red herring http knowledge wharton upenn edu article cfm articleid concluded that there is no evidence that separating the positions of chairman and ceo improves corporate performance in corporate governance update analyzing aspects of board composition david a katz and laura a mcintosh new york law journal january the authors concluded that from a board effectiveness perspective there is no need to separate the roles of chairman and ceo so long as there is an effective lead director in place in addition the majority of u s companies have not implemented the structure recommended by the proposal the board will continue to review krogers leadership structure to ensure that the structure best addresses krogers evolving and dynamic business in consultation with the current board and our shareholders the board believes that eliminating the flexibility to determine which type of leadership structure is not in our shareholders best interests for the foregoing reasons we urge you to vote against this proposal shareholder
