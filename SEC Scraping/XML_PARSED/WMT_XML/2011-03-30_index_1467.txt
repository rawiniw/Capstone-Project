exchange rates fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the united states and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale we may face impediments to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be affected adversely we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart u s segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores and hypermarts as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internet based retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internet based retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours in store amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see item business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and non food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and non food items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada chile costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal our walmart international operations generated of our net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the united states we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations natural disasters and geo political events could adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornados whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geo political events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distributions centers are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan and could adversely affect our financial performance in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily self insured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution centers loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v wal mart stores inc a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys fees on june the u s district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification which we have appealed on february a divided three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a decision affirming the district courts certification order on february the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on december the three judge panel withdrew its opinion of february and issued a revised opinion as a result the companys petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january on february the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition on april the ninth circuit issued a divided opinion affirming certain portions of the district courts ruling and reversing other portions on august the company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court seeking review of the ninth circuits decision which was granted by the united states supreme court on december the company filed its brief for petitioner on january the brief for respondents was filed on february and oral argument was held on march we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption item legal proceedings and in note to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k if we do not maintain the security of customer related information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at www walmart com and www samsclub com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary back up systems could harm our ability to run our business although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems our computer systems including our back up systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our back up systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share item b

restate comparable store and club sales results for previously reported years comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussions of our consolidated results and the operating results of our walmart international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to convert the walmart international segments operating results from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not denominated in the u s dollar in connection with the companys new financial system implementation we changed the level at which we apply the retail method of accounting for inventory the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable periods presented see notes to consolidated financial statements note accounting change in addition we reclassified certain revenue and expense items within our consolidated statements of income for financial reporting purposes the reclassifications did not impact consolidated operating income or consolidated net income attributable to walmart all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation the retail industry we operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the countries we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets many of which are national regional or international chains as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees whom we call associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions cost of goods consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability interest rates customer preferences unemployment labor costs inflation deflation currency exchange fluctuations fuel and energy prices weather patterns climate change catastrophic events competitive pressures and insurance costs further information on certain risks to our company can be located in item a risk factors in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the companys priority of growth focuses on sales through comparable store and club sales and unit square feet growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys objective to increase its operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing its operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of its net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs its assets as reflected in its return on investment roi and how effectively the company manages working capital as reflected in its free cash flow growth net sales

comparable store and club sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the growth in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year comparable store and club sales including fuel impact for the fiscal years ended january and are as follows with fuel fuel impact fiscalyearsendedjanuary fiscalyearsendedjanuary walmart u s sams club total u s comparable store and club sales in the u s including fuel decreased and in fiscal and respectively and increased in fiscal total u s comparable store and club sales decreased during fiscal primarily due to a decline in customer traffic although customer traffic increased in fiscal comparable store sales in the united states were lower than those in fiscal due to deflation in certain merchandise categories and lower fuel prices as we continue to add new stores in the united states we do so with an understanding that additional stores may take sales away from existing units we estimate the negative impact on comparable store sales as a result of opening new stores was approximately in fiscal in

comparing the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful measures as they indicate how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at a faster rate than net sales operating expenses for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales our operating expenses increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal while net sales increased during fiscal when compared to fiscal operating expenses grew at a slower rate than net sales due to improved labor productivity and organizational changes made at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our operations as well as a reduction regarding certain incentive plan expenses in fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales our fiscal operating expenses increased when compared to fiscal while net sales increased over the same period operating expenses grew at a faster rate than net sales due to higher health benefit costs restructuring charges and higher advertising expenses operating income

international segments met this objective in fiscal our sams club segment fell short of this objective primarily due to a million pre tax charge relating to a restructure of its operations including the closure of clubs returns return on investment management believes that return on investment is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was relatively stable at percent and percent for the fiscal years ended january and respectively we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows for the fiscal years endedjanuary dollar amounts in millions asadjusted calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average

total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of january certain balance sheet data as adjusted as adjusted total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and

dividing by based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of discontinued operations total assets as of january and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively effective may the company implemented a new financial system for its operations in the united states canada and puerto rico concurrent with this implementation and the increased system capabilities the company changed the level at which it applies the retail method of accounting for inventory in these operations from divisions to departments see notes to consolidated financial statements note accounting change free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated positive free cash flow of billion billion and billion for the years ended january and respectively the decline in free cash flow during fiscal as compared to fiscal is principally due to our increased investment in inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable the increase in free cash flow in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from improved operating results and relatively low inventory levels at january free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well

faster rate than net sales in addition fuel sales driven by higher fuel prices and gallons sold positively impacted comparable club sales by percentage points in fiscal the fiscal decrease in net sales primarily resulted from the decline in comparable club sales due to the negative impact of percentage points from lower fuel prices when compared to the previous fiscal year partially offset by sales increases in fresh food consumables and certain health and wellness categories volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the net sales and operating income of the sams club segment in the future gross profit margin was relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margin increased percentage points during fiscal compared to the prior year due to continued strength in sales of consumables fresh food and other food related categories operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased

expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased billion of our shares under the program or we earlier terminate or replace the program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status we spent approximately billion billion and billion for share repurchases during the fiscal years ended january and respectively we consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things our current cash needs our capacity for leverage our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock at january we had approximately billion of remaining authorization to spend for share repurchases under the existing program capital resources management believes cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt obligations as they mature and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets have historically provided us with substantial sources of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness continuing to be at or above the

debt issues were lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of the companys long term debt securities were lower than those noted above our ability to access the debt markets would be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt i e the rate of interest on any such indebtedness would be higher than our cost of funds had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long term financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long term financing decisions at january and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings long term debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due within one year long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases total capitalization is defined as debt plus total walmart shareholders equity our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased in fiscal resulting from an

the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty the expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations in addition to the amounts shown in the table above million of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities the timing of the payment associated with these liabilities is uncertain refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed and presented above the company has made certain guarantees as discussed below for which the timing of payment if any is unknown in connection with certain debt financing the company could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur at january the aggregate termination payment would have been million the arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal the company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately future locations these lease commitments have lease terms ranging from to years and provide for certain minimum rentals if executed payments under operating leases would increase by million for fiscal based on current cost

loss in the value of the debt of million summary of critical accounting policies management strives to report the financial results of the company in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing our consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates management continually reviews the companys accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements inventories the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segments merchandise inventories the retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the sams club segments merchandise is valued based on the weighted average cost using the lifo method inventories for the walmart international operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in first out fifo method at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo under the retail method inventory is stated at cost which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is based on the initial margin of beginning inventory plus the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo reserves is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any markdowns the retail method requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell through inventory and shrinkage when management determines the salability of inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather patterns and customer preferences related to fashion trends could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year when necessary the company records a lifo provision for a quarter for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo the company provides for estimated inventory losses shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales the provision is adjusted annually based on historical results to reflect the estimated trend of the actual physical inventory count results as discussed in note effective may the company changed the level at which it applies the retail method for valuing its inventory for its operations in the united states canada and puerto rico the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable periods presented impairment of assets we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance such as operating income and cash flows the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level or in certain circumstances at the market group level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived assets is impaired resulting in a write down of the long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired this evaluation requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative market based approach historically the company has generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items self insurance we use a combination of third party insurance self insured retention and self insurance for a number of risks including but not limited to workers compensation general liability vehicle liability property and the companys obligation for employee related health care benefits liabilities associated with any claims are estimated by considering historical claims experience including frequency severity demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions in calculating our liability we analyze our historical trends including loss development and apply appropriate loss development factors to the incurred costs associated with the claims made against our self insured program the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss development differ from these assumptions for example for our workers compensation and general liability accrual a increase or decrease to the assumptions for claims costs or loss development factors would increase or decrease our self insurance accrual by million

as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segments merchandise inventories the retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the sams club segments merchandise is valued based on the weighted average cost using the lifo method inventories for the walmart international operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in first out fifo method at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximate those inventories as if they were valued at fifo as discussed in note effective may the company changed the level at which it applies the retail method for valuing inventory for its operations in the united states canada and puerto rico the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well as consolidated net income for all comparable periods presented property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost

level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful life based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate segment when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining the fair value of the related reporting unit fair value is measured based on discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the analyses require significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections the company has not recorded impairment charges related to goodwill the following table reflects goodwill activity by operating segment for fiscal years and amounts in millions

renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company this expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the companys capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense

we reviewed and adjusted the classification of certain revenue and expense items within our consolidated statements of income for financial reporting purposes the reclassifications did not impact operating income or consolidated net income attributable to walmart the changes were effective february and have been reflected in all periods presented recent accounting pronouncements a new accounting standard effective for and adopted by the company on february changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie and requires companies to assess more frequently whether they must consolidate vies the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements note accounting change effective may the company implemented a new financial system for its operations in the united states canada and puerto rico concurrent with this implementation and the increased system capabilities the company changed the level at which it applies the retail method of accounting for inventory in these operations from divisions to departments the company believes the change is preferable because applying the retail method of accounting for inventory at the departmental level better segregates merchandise with similar cost to retail ratios and turnover as well as providing a more accurate cost of goods sold and ending inventory value at the lower of cost or market for each reporting period the retrospective application of this accounting change impacted both segment and consolidated operating income as well

settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop its own assumptions the disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost is as follows cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments short term debt the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments long term debt the fair value is based on the companys current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements or where

appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the

record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rates the contract terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings during the period instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change fair value instruments the company is party to receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating

exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the instruments being hedged the derivative instruments were assumed to be perfectly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of
