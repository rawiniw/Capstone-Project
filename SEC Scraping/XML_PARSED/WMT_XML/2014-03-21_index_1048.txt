our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these risks are not the only risks that we face our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the u s and globally as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations general or macro economic factors both domestically and internationally may adversely affect our financial performance general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our

utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges other changes in tax laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in

unavailability of consumer credit changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in

higher costs of labor insurance and healthcare currency exchange rate fluctuations higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the u s and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences whether involving physical retail e commerce retail or a combination of both retail offerings which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our e commerce businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency assortment of products customer experience and convenience these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including the key factors described above and spending patterns whether for our physical retail offerings e commerce offerings or through a combination of these retail offerings could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share we may face impediments to our expansion in the u s including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats which may adversely affect our financial performance our expansion strategy in the u s depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the u s and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sam s clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local real estate land use zoning and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sam s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the u s our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our walmart international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance our failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented our financial performance could be adversely affected we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail e commerce retail or through a combination of both areas which could adversely affect our financial performance the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers our walmart u s segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores and hypermarkets as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses our sam s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as internet based retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs internet based retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours in store amenities and price where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see item business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the u s political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the u s s foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and non food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and non food items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance our walmart international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business or financial performance we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly owned subsidiaries operating in argentina brazil canada china india japan and the united kingdom our majority owned subsidiaries operating in africa central america chile china and mexico and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal our walmart international operations generated approximately of our consolidated net sales as a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the u s we expect that our walmart international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints anti money laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our walmart international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our walmart international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the u s and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the u s additional risks inherent in our walmart international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the u s the various risks inherent in doing business in the u s generally also exist when doing business outside of the u s and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by u s laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u s laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance natural disasters changes in climate and geo political events could adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geo political events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as the march earthquake and tsunami in japan superstorm sandy in the u s in or numerous winter storm systems in the u s in and and could adversely affect our financial performance in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily self insured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v wal mart stores inc which was commenced as a class action lawsuit in june in the united states district court for the northern district of california asserting that the company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seeking among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys fees on

allegations on june the u s court of appeals for the seventh circuit denied the plaintiffs petition for permission to appeal we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption item legal proceedings and in note to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on going fcpa matter the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including wal mart de mxico s a b de c v or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and or misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anti corruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti corruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the u s department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmex s current and former officers we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on going government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions and or penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs incremental to the million of costs incurred in fiscal in conducting our on going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the on going nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future if the technology based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our e commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites including walmart com and samsclub com which are a part of our multi channel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multi channel sales strategy we offer a site to store program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sam s club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs any failure on our part to provide attractive user friendly online merchandising platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of online and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers associates vendors and others could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results as do most retailers we receive and store certain personal information about our customers in our information systems and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors we also utilize use third party service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers back office support and other functions in addition our online operations at www walmart com www samsclub com and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year computer hackers cyber terrorists and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information and have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our third party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us as a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures we believe that past attempts by computer hackers cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful nevertheless it is possible that computer hackers cyber terrorists and others through cyberattacks which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated or by other means might defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers associates and vendors that we hold any breach of our security measures or those of our third party service providers and loss of our confidential information which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers associates and vendors as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations as a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss issued by the pci council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data despite our compliance with these standards and other information security measures we cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any disruption results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card associations and others in addition the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary back up systems could harm our ability to run our business although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical information systems our information systems including our back up systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denial of service attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our information systems and our back up systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both our information systems and back up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our information systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives item b unresolved staff commentsnone item propertiesthe number of discount stores supercenters neighborhood markets other

walmart the company or we operates retail and other stores in various formats around the world and is committed to saving people money so they can live better our operations consist of three reportable segments walmart u s walmart international and sam s club the walmart u s segment includes the company s mass merchant concept in the united states u s operating under the walmart or wal mart brand with various formats including supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and other small stores as well as walmart com of our three segments walmart u s is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit rate in addition walmart u s has historically contributed the greatest amount to the company s net sales and operating income the walmart international segment consists of the company s operations outside of the u s including various retail websites walmart international operates retail wholesale and other types of units including restaurants and some banks the overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u s because of its merchandise mix walmart international has generally been our most rapidly growing segment growing primarily through new stores and acquisitions and in recent years has been growing its net sales and operating income at a faster rate than our other segments however for fiscal walmart international sales growth slowed due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as no significant acquisitions and operating income declined as a result of certain operating expenses the sam s club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the u s as well as samsclub com sam s club operates as a membership club warehouse with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments at walmart u s we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices edlp while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect integrity and diversity edlp is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activities our focus for sam s club is to provide exceptional value on brand name and private label merchandise at members only prices for both business and personal use internationally we operate with similar philosophies our fiscal year ends on january for our u s and canadian operations we consolidate all other operations generally using a one month lag and on a calendar year basis our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as different weather patterns historically our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january this discussion which presents our results for the fiscal years ended january fiscal january fiscal and january fiscal should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the company s performance additionally the discussion provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the company s segments using among other measures each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment s operating income or other measures which include certain corporate overhead allocations as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation the amounts disclosed for corporate and support in the leverage discussion of the company s performance metrics consist of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the company s segments table of contentscomparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmart s definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as e commerce sales we measure the e commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and fulfilled through our dedicated e commerce distribution facilities as well as an estimate for sales initiated online but fulfilled through our stores and clubs changes in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in retail square feet of more than five percent comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results we are referring to our operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future we made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these reclassifications did not impact the company s operating income or consolidated net income additionally certain prior period segment asset and expense allocations have been reclassified among segments to be comparable with the current period presentation the retail industrywe operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the countries we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees whom we call associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events climate change competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions inflation insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates unemployment and weather patterns further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be located in item a risk factors in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january and in the discussion under forward looking statements company performance metricsthe company s performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the company s priority of growth focuses on sales through comparable store and club sales including e commerce sales and unit square feet growth the priority of leverage encompasses the company s objective to increase its operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing its operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of its net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs its assets through return on investment and how effectively the company manages working capital

comparable club sales at sam s club the positive effect of these items was partially offset by billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and decreases in comparable store

existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar also known as the calendar and to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar our calendar comparable store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store

january fiscal years ended january walmart u s sam s club total u s comparable store and club sales in the u s including fuel decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year the total u s comparable store and club sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by lower consumer spending primarily due to the slow recovery in general economic conditions the increase in the payroll tax rate and the reduction in government food benefits and severe winter storms that occurred during the fourth quarter these factors were partially offset by increased member traffic at sam s club primarily coming from savings members additionally e commerce sales positively impacted walmart u s comparable store and sam s club comparable club sales percentages by approximately the total u s comparable store and club sales for fiscal increased as a result of improved average ticket and an increase in customer traffic as we continue to add new stores and clubs in the u s we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs to those of nearby non impacted stores and clubs in each case as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened table of contentsleverageoperating incomefiscal years

corporate and support operating income we believe comparing both the growth of our operating expenses and our operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful measures as they indicate how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective for a fiscal year is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at a faster rate than net sales on occasion we may make strategic growth investments that may at times cause our operating expenses to grow at a faster rate than net sales and that may result in our operating income growing at a slower rate than net sales operating expensesfor fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased basis points overall lower than anticipated net sales higher investment in key areas such as global leverage and e commerce initiatives and nearly billion of increased expenses for various matters described in the walmart international segment discussion were the primary causes for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales additional expenses related to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa inquiries and investigations as well as our global compliance program and related organizational enhancements also contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales the negative leverage impact of these items was partially offset by lower incentive expenses for fiscal for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales as operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points the fiscal decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to productivity improvements and expense management expenses incurred for the fcpa inquiries and investigations as well as our global compliance program and related organizational enhancements were millionand millionfor fiscal and respectively operating incomefor fiscal we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales as operating income decreased while net sales increased when compared to the previous fiscal year this was primarily due to the factors we discussed for not leveraging operating expenses partially offset by increases in membership and other income of for fiscal we also did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales as operating income increased while net sales increased when compared to the previous fiscal year the primary causes for operating income growing slower than net sales in fiscal were our increased investments in e commerce initiatives increased expenses related to the fcpa inquiries and investigations as well as our global compliance program and related organizational enhancements and investments in price which reduced gross margin table of contentsreturnsreturn on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was and for fiscal and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to a decline in operating income investments in property and equipment and the impact of acquisitions roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was and for fiscal and respectively we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve months or fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases roi differs from roa which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies table of contentsthe calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows fiscal years ended january amounts in millions calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating

payments as well as lower income from continuing operations and slightly higher capital expenditures the fiscal increase in free cash flow was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations positively impacting net cash generated from operating activities and lower capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider net cash provided by operating activities to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow management believes that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities as well as information regarding net

presented in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements our effective income tax rate for fiscal was higher than in fiscal primarily due to the tax impacts attributable to repatriated international earnings during fiscal our fiscal effective income tax rate was lower than in fiscal primarily because the fiscal rate benefited from a number of discrete tax items including the positive impact from fiscal legislative changes arising at the end of the fiscal year most notably the american taxpayer relief act of our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases or decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact

certain other proceedings summary of critical accounting estimatesmanagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements inventorieswe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segment s merchandise inventories the retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the sam s club segment s merchandise is valued based on the weighted average cost using the lifo method inventories for the walmart international segment are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in first out fifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is stated at cost which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns the retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as table of contentswell as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather patterns and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo we provide for estimated inventory losses or shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales following annual inventory counts the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance such as operating income and cash flows the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level or in certain markets at the market group level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived assets is impaired resulting in a write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative market based approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted income taxesincome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the u s statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies heavily on estimates table of contentsforward

technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches for the reporting units that were tested using only the qualitative assessment management determined that the fair value of each reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount and as a result quantitative analyses were not required for the reporting units tested using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount accordingly the company has not recorded any

measurementsthe company records and discloses certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities at their fair value the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the levels of the fair value hierarchy are level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable andlevel unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop its own assumptions recurring fair value measurementsthe company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis the fair values are the estimated amounts the company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates the fair values have been measured using the income approach and

financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies subsequent to entering into derivative transactions the

counterparty the company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at january or january the company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and accordingly the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings the company s net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been and is not expected to be significant instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change fair value instrumentsthe company is a party to receive fixed rate pay variable rate interest rate swaps that the company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the company s exposure due to credit loss the company s interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay variable interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed rate debt being hedged the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items also recorded in earnings and

designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings the hedged items are recognized foreign currency denominated liabilities that are remeasured at spot exchange rates each period and the assessment of effectiveness and measurement of any ineffectiveness is based on total changes in the related derivative s cash flows as a result the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that remeasurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period s allocable portion of the initial spot forward difference associated with the hedging instrument these cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from september to march the company also uses forward starting receive variable rate pay fixed rate swaps forward starting swaps to hedge its exposure to the variability in future cash flows due to changes in the libor swap rate for and year debt issuances forecasted to occur in the future amounts reported in

liquidity needs will be met through other funding sources ongoing cash flows generated from operations external borrowings or both accordingly management intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u s in its foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through global funding structures and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the company s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within the company s foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits as of january and cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion may not be freely

market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that

appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not significant goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches for the reporting units that were tested using only the qualitative assessment management determined that the fair value of each reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount and as a result quantitative analyses were not required for the reporting units tested using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount accordingly the

effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates in

other acquired intangible assets goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches for the reporting units that were tested using only the qualitative assessment management determined that the fair value of each reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount and as a result quantitative analyses were not required for the reporting units tested using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following
