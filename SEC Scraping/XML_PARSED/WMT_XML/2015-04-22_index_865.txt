to yahoo in fiscal ms mayer was not involved in any transaction between walmart and yahoo and did not have a direct or indirect material interest in any transaction between walmart and yahoo based on the boards consideration of ms mayers positions at yahoo and the other factors relating to the transactions between walmart and yahoo the board determined that ms mayers interest in yahoo did not give

years of service and may not serve for more than years retirement age unless they have not yet completed their initial six year commitment independent directors may not stand for reelection after age the board may make exceptions to these retirement policies if circumstances warrant for example the board could extend the term limit or retirement age for an individual director with particular skills or qualifications that are valuable to the boards effectiveness until a suitable replacement is found similarly an independent director may retire before serving years in order to avoid excessive turnover on the board or a board committee in a short period of time the board believes that these policies have helped to provide discipline to the board refreshment process and have resulted in a diverse board with an effective mix of skills experiences and tenures as shown on page as a part of the process of identifying potential director candidates the cngc may consult with other directors and senior officers and may engage a search firm to assist in the process spencer stuart currently serves as the cngcs director candidate search consultant in this capacity spencer

executive vice president president and ceo walmart u s david cheesewright executive vice president president and ceo walmart international rosalind g brewer executive vice president president and ceo sams club neil m ashe executive vice president president and ceo global ecommerce disclosure regarding mr ashes compensation for fiscal is not required under sec rules nevertheless we have included compensation information for mr ashe in this proxy statement on the same basis as our other neos we chose to include this information in the proxy statement for continuity purposes as we expect that the executive officers required to be included as neos will vary from year to year among the executives listed above we also believe it is important to provide shareholders with information regarding how our compensation plans are designed to incentivize and support our global ecommerce strategies integrated into our operating segments executive summary fiscal highlights as the worlds largest retailer walmart continues to operate in a challenging highly competitive and rapidly evolving global environment in fiscal we outlined our enterprise strategy for positioning our company for long term success key highlights included successful senior leadership transitions with a new company president and ceo and a new walmart international ceo effective at the beginning of fiscal and a new walmart u s ceo taking over mid year all of these appointments were internal promotions and reflect our bench strength and the boards and the cngcs focus on succession planning and talent development we believe that our executive compensation program is a key element and facilitator of our succession planning strategy consolidated net sales grew operating income increased and return on investment roi was slightly lower than the prior fiscal year walmart u s improved its sales and operating income throughout the year and fourth quarter comparable store sales were the strongest in more than two years similarly sams club comparable club sales without fuel continued to improve throughout the year and sams club had solid operating income on a constant currency basis walmart international produced solid sales and operating income globally e commerce sales grew we continued to provide solid returns to our shareholders with total shareholder return or tsr of and our stock price ending the year near an all time high we also increased our dividend for the st consecutive year and returned approximately billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we continued to make key investments to position our company to meet the rapidly changing needs of our customers these included ecommerce initiatives as we continue to work toward a seamless digital and physical integration for our customers we continued to invest in our global compliance program and shortly after the end of fiscal we announced a major investment in associate opportunity including increases in associate pay improvements to our scheduling system realignments to our store operational structure and enhancements to our training and educational programs despite these achievements our financial performance did not meet the challenging targets established by the cngc at the beginning of fiscal accordingly as described below our short and long term incentive pay was below target levels proxy statement back to contents our executive compensation philosophy the cngc has carefully structured our executive compensation programs to motivate and retain key executives with the ultimate goal of facilitating our enterprise strategy generating strong operating results and delivering solid returns to our shareholders we believe we have an outstanding leadership team that is essential to the future success of our company we have developed our compensation programs for our leadership team to align with our culture strategy and structure our executive compensation program is intended to align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders by rewarding good performance aligned with our strategy encouraging accountability motivating performance that drives long term shareholder value in a simple easily communicated manner and attracting and retaining highly qualified executives our compensation program emphasizes performance and balances short and long term incentives in keeping with our pay for performance philosophy more than of our neos fiscal target total direct compensation or tdc is based on achieving specified performance targets related to sales operating income and roi our executive compensation program is designed to focus our leadership and balance short term performance and long term strategic priorities this program is also intended to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders throughout our business and investment cycles our incentive payouts reflect company performance payouts under our annual cash incentive plan and long term performance share unit plan continue to be closely aligned with our operating results and demonstrate our commitment to our pay for performance philosophy this alignment between pay and performance is also demonstrated by the most recent payouts under our incentive plans annual cash incentive payments to our neos for fiscal which were primarily based on operating income and sales metrics were significantly below target ranging from to of target payouts with our ceo receiving a payout equal to of target see pages for more information about our annual cash incentive plan including the performance metrics used in this plan performance share unit payouts to our neos for the fiscal through fiscal performance cycle were also well below target levels ranging from to of target for more information about our performance share unit program which is based on sales and roi metrics see pages proxy statement back to contents ceo payouts under our incentive plans fiscal incentive payments have been consistently aligned with our companys performance as demonstrated in the following graph showing the combined value of the annual cash incentive and long term performance share unit payouts to our ceos over the past three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal solid operating income performance in fiscal resulted in an annual cash incentive payment to our ceo of approximately million slightly above his target payout we also had solid sales and roi performance in fiscal but our ceos long term performance share unit payout for the three year period ending january was million below target due to weaker sales and roi performance during fiscal and fiscal our tsr was for fiscal and for the three year period ending january a challenging global retail environment during fiscal resulted in operating income that was below expectations leading to our ceo receiving an annual cash incentive payment of approximately million more than million less than his target payout we also fell short of sales and roi targets resulting in a long term performance share unit payout for the three year period ending january that was million below target our tsr was for fiscal and for the three year period ending january while our financial performance improved throughout fiscal we fell short of the challenging operating income sales and roi targets established at the beginning of fiscal as a result our ceos annual cash incentive payout was approximately million once again significantly below his target payout our ceos performance share unit payout for the three year period ending january was million below target our tsr was for fiscal and for the three year period ending january proxy statement back to contents shareholder engagement and consideration of last years say on pay vote following our annual shareholders meeting the cngc considered the results of the non binding advisory vote on our executive compensation

investment community senior representatives of the company held meetings with a number of significant shareholders as well as with leading proxy advisory firms to discuss executive compensation matters governance matters and other issues of interest to our shareholders we value the feedback provided by our shareholders and look forward to continuing this dialogue in these meetings shareholders generally expressed a positive view of our executive compensation program and its link to performance but requested enhanced disclosure regarding certain topics while our investors expressed a wide range of viewpoints during these conversations key themes regarding our executive compensation program included the following investor questions our responses why dont we use tsr or other relative performance metrics in our executive compensation program while the cngc closely monitors walmarts performance relative to peers when making compensation decisions the cngc determined that there are key differences in walmarts business compared to other u s based retailers that make it unworkable to base our executives pay on relative performance compared to a peer group these differences include our size our significant international operations our product mix and our variety of formats additionally the price of walmart stock has historically been less volatile than the common stock of most of our retail peers which makes relative tsr an imprecise measure of our performance compared to other retailers as explained more fully on pages the cngc believes that the best approach for walmart is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are aligned with our strategy that can be directly impacted by our executives and that are designed to promote shareholder value over the long term has the cngc made performance goals easier to achieve in recent years no as explained more fully on page our performance goals are in line with our operating plans which are established with input and review by the board these operating plans are developed in the context of our long term strategic plans which are developed at a series of board meetings each year like our operating plans our performance goals vary from year to year and reflect economic conditions planned capital expenditures and other strategic decisions for example our operating income and roi goals reflect our significant ongoing investments in our e commerce operations and our global compliance program the cngcs independent compensation consultant regularly analyzes our performance goals and has consistently found them to be challenging a conclusion that is supported by our recent history of below target incentive payouts shown on page above why does the cngc make adjustments to our reported results of operations for incentive plan purposes as discussed more fully on pages the cngc makes a limited number of positive and negative adjustments as required by the terms of our incentive plans or contemplated at the time performance goals are set these adjustments are not outcome driven and are intended to ensure that pay is aligned with performance and that we are incentivizing the right behavior for example our incentive plans require that reported results be adjusted to remove the effect of store closings restructurings acquisitions and dispositions the cngc believes that decisions regarding these matters should not be influenced by considerations of how these actions may impact incentive payouts similarly executives should neither be rewarded nor punished due to events outside their control such as currency exchange rate fluctuations why does the cngc sometimes grant special or retention awards the cngc believes that targeted special awards used selectively have proven effective in retaining and motivating key executives through periods of leadership transition we believe that the selective use of special awards has been instrumental in our ability to successfully manage two ceo transitions since we revised the cda to provide more information regarding the specific rationale for each special award granted in fiscal see page why do we set performance goals annually under our long term performance share unit program as a global retailer our operating results are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control these macroeconomic factors along with the rapidly evolving retail landscape make it difficult to forecast accurately over a multi year period similar to the long term incentive plans used by many retailers performance goals for our three year performance share unit grants are set annually and payouts are determined based on average performance over each of the three years within each performance cycle see page for more information regarding the rationale for this approach why do we grant feather in performance share unit awards for newly hired or promoted executives under our long term incentive plan in appropriate circumstances we may make feather in grants of performance share units when executives are hired or promoted to significantly larger roles these feather in awards result in these executives having an opportunity to realize a performance share unit payout following their first full year in role we believe that this approach has helped to incentivize both short and long term performance and also provides recruiting and retention value it is important to note that when executives retire or otherwise leave the company all unvested performance share units for performance cycles that are still in progress are forfeited and we do not accelerate the vesting of any performance share units see page for more information proxy statement back to contents our executive compensation practices we are committed to executive compensation practices that drive performance and mitigate risk and that align the interests of our leadership team with the interests of our shareholders below is a summary of best practices that we have implemented and practices we avoid because we believe they are not in the best interests of our company or our shareholders what we do what we do not do pay for performance a significant majority of our executives target compensation is performance based and tied to pre established performance goals aligned with our short and long term objectives no employment contracts all of our neos are employed on an at will basis mitigation of risk by using a variety of performance measures in our incentive programs we mitigate the risk that our executives will be motivated to pursue results with respect to one performance measure to the detriment of our company as a whole no unapproved trading plans board members and executive officers are prohibited from entering into securities trading plans pursuant to sec rule b without the pre approval of our corporate secretary modest perquisites we provide only a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives no hedging board members and associates are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions that could eliminate or limit the risks and rewards of walmart share ownership responsible use of equity compensation our burn rate from the issuance of equity compensation is low relative to our retail peers any dilution from the issuance of equity compensation has historically been more than offset by our share repurchase program no speculative trading board members and associates are prohibited from short selling walmart stock buying or selling puts and calls of walmart stock or engaging in any other speculative transaction involving walmart stock compensation recoupment policies both our annual cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan contain robust recoupment provisions no liberal share recycling we do not add back to our plan reserves any shares tendered as payment for an option exercise or shares withheld for taxes our stock incentive plan removes provisions that would allow for shares to be recycled in this manner stock ownership guidelines our board has established robust stock ownership guidelines applicable to our board members and executive officers no use of walmart stock as collateral for margin loans board members and executive officers are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan independent compensation consultant the cngc benefits from its use of an independent compensation consulting firm which provides no other services to the company no unapproved pledging of walmart stock board members and executive officers may not pledge walmart stock without the pre approval of our corporate secretary any pledged shares will not count towards a board members or executive officers stock ownership requirements thorough compensation benchmarking the cngc reviews publicly available information for three different peer groups to evaluate how our neos compensation compares to that of executives in comparable positions at other companies no dividends on unearned performance share units we do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned and unvested performance share units annual pay for performance review with the help of its independent compensation consultant the cngc annually analyzes the difficulty of our performance goals and the alignment of realizable pay and performance to ensure that our incentive programs are working as intended no pension plans or special retirement programs for executive officers we do not have a pension plan in the united states and except as described otherwise on page executive officers do not participate in any retirement programs not generally available to all officers annual shareholder say on pay our shareholders have the opportunity each year to provide input on our executive compensation programs through an annual say on pay vote no change in control provisions other than non competition agreements providing for limited severance payments we do not have any plans or agreements under which our executive officers would receive payments or accelerated stock vestings in the event of a change in control of our company proxy statement back to contents components of neo compensation and pay mix what are the primary components of our neo compensation packages there are three components of our executives total direct compensation or tdc base salary annual cash incentive and long term equity consisting of a mix of performance share units and restricted stock restricted stock units annual long term equity base salary annual cash incentive restricted stock restricted stock units performance share units objective provide fixed base of cash compensation commensurate with position and experience achieve annual performance align neos interests with shareholders retention tool achieve long term performance and align neos interests with shareholders performance rewarded established in light of individual neos particular skills experience responsibilities and individual performance operating income and sales increase in share price sales and roi increase in share price a portion of mr ashes annual cash incentive payment is also based on the gross merchandise value of the global ecommerce operations of our operating segments on a combined basis defined on page below base salary we pay base salaries commensurate with each neos position and experience in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates a relatively small percentage of tdc to base salary annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment based on a percentage of base salary this cash incentive payment can range from of target payout opportunity if threshold performance goals are met to a maximum of of target payout opportunity long term equity the largest portion of our neos tdc consists of two types of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity helps to align the interests of our neos with the long term interests of our shareholders and also serves as a retention tool performance share units consistent with our pay for performance philosophy of each neos annual long term equity award value consists of performance share units generally performance share units granted to our executives have a three year performance period with the performance measures and goals set annually by the cngc the number of shares that an neo receives at the end of the performance period is based on the average performance with respect to these performance goals during each of these three years our neos can earn from if threshold performance goals are met up to a maximum of of the target number of shares restricted stock or restricted stock units the remaining of each neos annual long term equity award value consists of restricted stock restricted stock units which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the neo remains employed by our company through the vesting date proxy statement back to contents how much of our neos tdc was performance based in fiscal as shown in the chart below a substantial majority of our neos fiscal target tdc was performance based base salary represented less than of our ceos target tdc for fiscal while more than of our ceos target tdc was tied to performance goals for each of our other neos at least of target tdc was performance based the percentages may not total due to rounding target tdc mr mcmillon mr holley mr foran mr cheesewright ms brewer mr ashe what performance measures were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal and why did the cngc select these measures as in the prior year our neos performance based pay was based on achieving objective goals related to the financial metrics of operating income sales and roi for some of our neos these goals were based partly on the performance of one of our operating segments or the performance of the neos area of responsibility in addition a portion of mr ashes performance based pay was based on global ecommerce gross merchandise value of our operating segments on a combined basis proxy statement back to contents the following charts show the portion of each of our neos incentive pay opportunity that was subject to each of these measures during fiscal the percentages may not total due to rounding during fiscal and fiscal at the direction of the cngc the company undertook a comprehensive review of the performance metrics used in our executive compensation program and concluded that the metrics described above are appropriate and effective in driving results tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the cngc considered the following factors these performance measures are aligned with our strategy and can be impacted by our executives unlike measures tied to stock price or shareholder return our executives can have a direct impact on our sales operating income roi and gmv performance these performance measures are important metrics for judging retail performance sales operating income and roi measures have historically been and continue to be important indicators of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these areas is important to our shareholders similarly gmv is a key indicator of e commerce performance the cngc believes that success with respect to these performance measures will support shareholder value over the long term at the request of the cngc the cngcs independent compensation consultant reviewed the historical correlation between various performance metrics and tsr within the retail industry the cngcs independent compensation consultant found that the metrics used in walmarts short and long term incentive plans are generally aligned with tsr in the retail industry we believe that good performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value over the long term it is unworkable to effectively apply relative performance metrics to walmarts executive compensation program there are several key differences in our business compared to other publicly traded retailers in the u s including our size our significant international operations our product mix and our variety of formats additionally the price of walmart common stock has historically been significantly less volatile than the common stock of most of our retail peers the cngc concluded that these factors make it unworkable to base our executives incentive pay on relative tsr performance or other relative performance metrics the combination of these performance measures mitigates risk using a combination of performance measures mitigates the risk that our executives could be motivated to pursue results with respect to one measure to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact operating income or roi resulting proxy statement back to contents increases in incentive pay based on sales should be offset by decreases in incentive pay based on the other metrics the specific weighting between these metrics reflects a balancing of the overall strategic goals of our company in addition to the financial metrics described above our neos annual cash incentive pay is also based on performance with respect to diversity goals and compliance goals described below on page our incentive compensation programs during fiscal what were the financial goals under our annual cash incentive plan for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to those goals as noted above while our performance improved throughout the course of fiscal our operating income

incentive plan for fiscal diversity goals since fiscal a portion of most officers cash incentive payment has also been subject to satisfying diversity objectives and each neos cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to if he or she does not satisfy these objectives the cngc established these diversity goals because it believes that diversity and inclusion contribute to an engaged and effective workforce for fiscal these objectives consisted of one or both of two components good faith efforts and placement objectives each of our neos is subject to good faith efforts requirements in order to satisfy the good faith efforts component of this program each neo must actively sponsor at least two associates and must also participate in at least two diversity related events each of our neos with responsibility for walmart u s and or sams club field operations is also subject to placement objectives for fiscal mr mcmillon mr foran and ms brewer were subject to placement objectives the determination as to whether an neo satisfied his or her placement objectives during the prior fiscal year is based on several factors including the relative number of diverse candidates placed in specified positions within the neos organization the neos engagement and participation in diversity and inclusion strategies the neos leadership efforts in implementing these strategies and the neos efforts in recruiting and developing diverse associates applying these factors at the end of each fiscal year our chief diversity officer reviews each neos performance under our diversity program and

or decrease in bps compared to prior fiscal year walmart asia sales increase over prior fiscal year proxy statement back to contents why doesnt the cngc set three year goals for the long term performance share unit program the cngc has found that the current approach of setting goals annually with payouts determined by averaging performance over a three year period is the most effective approach for our long term performance share unit program for the following reasons as a global retailer walmarts operating results are significantly impacted by macroeconomic and regional economic factors outside of managements control these economic factors as well as the rapidly evolving retail landscape make it difficult to forecast accurately over a three year period for example in fiscal our officers were granted performance share units with three year sales and roi performance goals subsequently the global financial downturn in had the effect of making these three year goals virtually unachievable only a few months into the three year performance period the cngc reasoned that performance goals cease to be an effective tool in motivating performance if the goals either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve while some companies attempt to address the impact of macroeconomic factors by using relative goals in their long term incentive plans the cngc has determined that relative goals are not the right approach for walmart for the reasons described on page above the cngc regularly reviews walmarts performance relative to peers and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive programs are operating as intended another advantage of our current approach is more easily understandable and better aligned performance goals which the cngc believes are more effective in motivating performance as described above our incentive goals are aligned with our business plan and expectations regarding financial performance these necessarily change from year to year based on macroeconomic conditions strategic investments and other factors setting three year sales goals for example would result in a situation in which our leaders have three differing sales goals at any one time one for each outstanding tranche of performance share units the cngc believes that the current performance share unitsstructure effectively balances long term focus with clear and understandable performance goals adjustments why do we adjust reported results of operations for purposes of our incentive plans both our annual incentive plan and our stock incentive plan require that certain adjustments be made to our reported results of operations for purposes of calculating incentive awards the purpose of these adjustments is to cause incentive awards to be calculated on a comparable basis from year to year and to ensure that participants in these plans are incentivized and rewarded appropriately many of these adjustments including a substantial majority of the aggregate adjustments made during fiscal are adjustments that the cngc expected to make at the time incentive goals are established by the cngc for example our incentive plans require that reported results be adjusted to remove the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations given our significant international operations which contribute approximately of our total revenues fluctuations in currency exchange rates which are generally out of our managements control often have a significant impact on our financial results the cngc typically sets sales goals that exclude the impact of fuel sales because fuel prices and therefore our fuel sales are subject to significant fluctuation and are outside of managements ability to control in light of our significant ongoing investments in global ecommerce when the cngc established fiscal operating income goals for our operating segments it limited the operating losses attributable to the ecommerce operations of those operating segments for incentive plan purposes like many other companies our incentive plans dictate that we make other adjustments to our results of operations for incentive plan purposes for items that may not be known at the beginning of the fiscal year when goals are set for example our plans require that we make adjustments for the impact of store closings restructurings acquisitions and dispositions we do not believe that a decision regarding these types of events should be influenced by a consideration of how these actions might impact the incentive pay of our management the cngc believes that our compensation plans should not serve as a disincentive that could discourage management from making decisions that are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders the cngc undertakes a rigorous oversight and certification process to determine the adjustments required by our incentive plans this process is not outcome driven and includes both positive and negative adjustments while the adjustments made for fiscal had a net positive impact on incentive payouts this is not always the case for example in fiscal and fiscal the adjustment process resulted in a reduction in incentive payouts proxy statement back to contents what adjustments were made to fiscal reported results for incentive plan purposes operating incomeannual cash incentive plan for fiscal the substantial majority of adjustments to operating income pursuant to the terms of our annual cash incentive plan consisted of the following items the first three of which are required by the terms of our incentive plans and the fourth of which was established by the cngc at the time goals were set in early fiscal an adjustment to remove the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations which adjustment had a net positive impact on operating income for annual incentive plan purposes adjustments to remove the impact of expenses related to store closings and restructurings in the u s canada and japan which adjustments positively impacted operating income for incentive plan purposes adjustments to remove the impact for losses and accruals for litigation related to events that occurred in prior periods generally under prior management teams which adjustments had a positive impact on operating income for purposes of our annual cash incentive plan adjustments to remove the impact of losses attributable to walmart com and samsclub com in excess of a pre set limit established by the cngc when goals were set at the beginning of fiscal from walmart u s and sams club operating income which had the effect of increasing operating income for purposes of our annual cash incentive plan other adjustments to fiscal operating income for incentive plan purposes included adjustments to remove the impact of the following items each of which are required by the terms of our incentive plans costs related to e commerce acquisitions which adjustments positively impacted operating income gains on the sale of real estate and other assets which adjustments negatively impacted operating income losses related to uninsured damage to stores resulting from a hurricane which had the effect of increasing operating income for annual incentive plan purposes these adjustments taken together had the effect of increasing the fiscal operating income of our total company and of each operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our neos as calculated for purposes of our annual cash incentive program as a result of these adjustments the percentage increases in fiscal operating income compared to prior year operating income for purposes of our cash incentive plan as shown in the actual performance as adjusted column in the table on page were somewhat greater than the increases in our publicly reported operating income for fiscal the table on page above shows the net impact of these adjustments on the operating income of our total company and the operating income attributable to the operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our neos as calculated for purposes of our cash incentive plan salesannual cash incentive plan and long term performance share unit program for fiscal there were two primary adjustments to sales for purposes of our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program both of these adjustments were contemplated at the time goals were set in early fiscal an adjustment to exclude fuel sales which adjustment was mandated at the time the cngc established goals we generally exclude fuel sales from our incentive plan results due to the high volatility of fuel prices an adjustment for the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations which was also mandated at the time goals were established this adjustment positively impacted sales for purposes of our incentive plans these adjustments taken together had the effect of increasing the sales of our total company and the sales attributable to each operating segment and or area of responsibility of each of our neos as calculated for purposes of our annual cash incentive plan and performance share unit program as a result of these adjustments the percentage increases in fiscal sales over fiscal sales for purposes of our incentive plans as shown in the actual as adjusted column in the tables on pages and were greater than the increases in sales reflected in our publicly reported operating results for fiscal as calculated in accordance with gaap the tables on pages and above show the net impact of these adjustments on the sales of our total company and on the sales attributable to the operating segment or area of responsibility for each of our neos as calculated for purposes of our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program roilong term performance share unit program for fiscal the primary difference between our reported roi and roi for purposes of our performance share unit program is that roi for performance share unit program purposes excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations excluding currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of decreasing our roi for fiscal for purposes of our performance share unit program as compared to our reported roi in addition when calculating roi for purposes of our performance share unit program we use the adjusted operating income results used for calculating our annual cash incentive payouts described above since these adjustments had the effect of increasing fiscal operating income for annual cash incentive plan purposes these adjustments also positively impacted roi for performance share unit program purposes and partially offset the negative impact of the currency exchange rate adjustment the table on page above shows the net impact of this adjustment on our roi as calculated for purposes of our performance share unit program proxy statement back to contents other compensation what other types of compensation did our neos receive during fiscal special restricted stock awards our neos may from time to time receive special awards the cngc believes that the targeted use of these awards have proven effective in retaining and motivating key executives through periods of leadership transition have been instrumental in our ability to successfully manage our last two ceo transitions and have allowed us to maintain leadership continuity in a highly competitive market during fiscal three of our neos received special restricted stock awards prior to assuming his current role mr foran received a special restricted stock unit award in may vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date this award was made in connection with his promotion from president and ceo walmart china to become president and ceo walmart asia and was also intended to compensate for the fact that mr foran would no longer be eligible to participate in a walmart china long term incentive plan ms brewer received a million special restricted stock award in september vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date and mr holley received a million special restricted stock award in november vesting at the end of fiscal the cngc approved these awards for retention purposes in the context of our leadership transition during fiscal with mr mcmillon being promoted to president and ceo of our company at the beginning of fiscal and mr foran being promoted to president and ceo of our walmart u s segment in august the cngc believes that retaining our current leadership team is critical at this time for future succession planning and execution of our enterprise strategy special performance based awards on occasion the cngc also grants special cash based performance awards to our executives the purpose of these awards is typically to drive performance with respect to a specific performance metric or strategic initiative in september the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for ms brewer in the amount of million in order for ms brewer to earn this award sams club gross membership income must exceed our business plan for sams club gross membership income by a specified amount during the one year period ending july the cngc approved this special award opportunity for ms brewer to drive performance in light of sams clubs initiatives to increase membership and membership income which are key components of our sams club strategy feather in performance share unit awards under our long term performance share unit program we customarily make additional grants of performance share units to newly hired executives or when executives are promoted to significantly larger roles these feather in awards allow executives to realize performance share unit payouts commensurate with their positions for three year cycles that are already in progress we believe that this approach has helped to appropriately incentivize and reward short and long term performance and also provides retention value unlike some companies when executives retire or otherwise leave the company all unvested performance share units are forfeited and we do not accelerate the vesting or otherwise pay out any outstanding performance share units in january in connection with his recent promotion to president and ceo of our walmart u s segment mr foran received two additional feather in performance share unit grants vesting at the conclusion of the performance cycles ending january and january these additional performance share unit awards were intended to increase mr forans target performance share units opportunity for each of those cycles to which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share units award granted in january for the performance cycle ending january additional mip award under the terms of the management incentive plan the cngc may award an additional cash incentive amount based on individual performance for his performance during fiscal the cngc awarded mr cheesewright an additional cash incentive amount equal to of his target annual cash incentive award for fiscal approximately the cngc awarded this amount to mr cheesewright based on the solid constant currency sales and operating income performance of walmart international in a difficult global environment as well as mr cheesewrights contributions to strategic initiatives including e commerce initiatives in international markets and management of our international portfolio through targeted closings of underperforming stores what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations for our neos and provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a limited

process and governance who establishes the tdc at walmart the cngc is the board committee that is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the officers subject to section including the ceo and other neos all members of the cngc are independent see page for more information on the cngc the cngc met eight times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including matters such as the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance measures and performance goals for our short and long term incentive plans and the review of performance against those goals including compliance and diversity goals how does the cngc establish tdc the cngc considers a variety of factors in setting tdc for our neos including the overall financial and operating performance of our company and its operating segments and or areas of responsibility as applicable each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience our overall succession planning and the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future and peer group data and analyses see pages for more details how does the cngc set performance goals performance goals are established in the context of and consistent with the companys enterprise strategy and financial operating plans each fiscal year the process begins with the boards review of the companys overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and culminating at an annual board strategic retreat each september following the strategic retreat the annual operating plans of the company and each of its operating segments are established with spfc and board input the cngc then establishes performance goals under our short and long term incentive programs that are consistent with these operating plans incentive plans informed by strategic and financial planning process long range planning april september annual operating plan september january incentive plans january march assess competitive landscape and macro trends refine enterprise strategy and segment specific initiatives develop annual operating plan in light of long range planning and strategic initiatives october investor conferencereview strategy and planned capital expenditures review choice of incentive metrics to ensure that they support enterprise strategy establish performance goals aligned with annual operating plan walmarts operating plans are intended to be challenging and fiscal was no exception generally incentive goals are established so that performance in line with our operating plans should result in target payouts in order to achieve the maximum goals our performance would have to exceed our operating plans to a significant degree threshold performance goals are set at a level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify a payout the cngc generally attempts to set the performance goals so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the cngcs independent compensation consultant annually evaluates the difficulty of the performance goals and has consistently found these goals to be challenging proxy statement back to contents what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations of these neos provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our global people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews the annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc when establishing and approving the compensation of our ceo our chairman with support from our global people division and the chair of the cngc reviews our ceos performance evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation since early the cngc has engaged an independent consultant on executive compensation matters since early pay governance llc pay governance has been engaged by the cngc as its independent executive compensation consultant under the terms of its engagement pay governance reports directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc has sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any other services to walmart without the approval of the cngc other than its engagement by the cngc pay governance does not perform and has never performed any other services for walmart the cngcs independent consultant attends and participates in cngc meetings at which executive compensation matters are considered and performs analyses for the cngc at the cngcs request including benchmarking realizable pay analyses analyses of the correlation between performance measures and shareholder return and assessments of the difficulty of attaining performance goals the cngc annually reviews the independence of pay governance in light of sec rules and nyse listed company rules regarding compensation consultant independence and has affirmatively concluded that pay governance is independent from walmart and has no conflicts of interest relating to its engagement by the cngc how is peer group data used by the cngc walmart is the worlds largest retailer by a substantial margin and there are significant differences in our business compared to most other publicly traded retailers in the u s in addition to our size and scope these differences include our product mix the fact that we have significantly more extensive international operations than most u s based retailers and our variety of formats as described above on page these differences make it unworkable to base our incentive pay on our performance relative to retail peers these differences also mean that executive positions at walmart are generally significantly larger in size scope and complexity than similar positions at many of our retail peers to account for these differences the cngc reviews publicly available compensation information for three separate peer groups when establishing tdc for our executives retail industry survey this peer group allows the cngc to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary u s based competitors in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly traded retail companies with significant u s operations with annual revenues exceeding approximately billion by almost any measure walmart is the largest company in the retail industry survey and compared to the median of this peer group walmart is approximately times larger in terms of revenue and approximately times larger in terms of market capitalization select fortune the cngc also benchmarks our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by our global people division with input from the cngcs independent consultant the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we exclude retailers from this group because those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also exclude companies with business models that are broadly divergent from ours such as financial institutions and energy companies top while the select fortune includes some larger companies than the retail industry survey walmart is still the largest company within the select fortune in terms of revenues and is the third largest in terms of market capitalization to account for this size discrepancy and the corresponding complexity of our neos job responsibilities the cngc also benchmarks our neos pay against the largest public companies including selected non u s based companies excluding walmart in terms of market capitalization at the time of the review even among the top walmart is the largest company in terms of revenue and in the top quartile in terms of market capitalization the cngc uses benchmarking data as a general guide to ensure that the tdcs of our executives are set at an appropriately competitive level as well as ensuring that our neos mix of compensation is consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation the cngc does not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them while the cngc reviews benchmarking data for comparable positions within each of these peer groups the cngc also benchmarks the compensation of mr foran mr cheesewright ms brewer and mr ashe against ceo positions within the retail industry survey these executives have significant responsibilities and lead organizations that are considered separately from the rest of our company larger than many of the other retailers in the retail peer group and we believe that these positions are comparable in many respects to ceo positions at many of our peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint we believe that it is more likely that these leaders would be recruited for a ceo position in the retail industry or elsewhere rather than for a lateral move proxy statement back to contents as a general guideline the cngc seeks to place our neos target tdc near the th percentile of comparable positions within our peer groups taken as a whole the cngc believes that it is generally appropriate to position our neos target tdc at this level because as described above our companys size extensive international presence and complex operations result in our neos jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at many of our peer group companies the target tdc opportunity for a particular neo may be higher or lower than the th percentile of the peer groups and may differ from the tdc of our other neos depending on a number of factors including the factors described under how does the cngc establish tdc on page above what companies were included in our peer groups for fiscal and how did our neos compensation compare to those peers when the cngc reviewed and approved fiscal executive compensation in january our three peer groups described above included the following companies retail industry survey amazon com inc the home depot inc rite aid

factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized and realizable compensation the cngc reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years the cngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized and realizable compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys global people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation realizable by each neo for the upcoming fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation as noted above on page our shareholders have expressed support for our executive compensation program at each of our last three annual shareholders meetings the cngc considered that support as well as other feedback from our shareholders when deciding to maintain the overall structure of our executive compensation program for fiscal and when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal the cngc will continue to consider the outcome of these annual shareholder advisory votes and other feedback from our shareholders when making future compensation decisions regarding our neos what are our practices for equity awards including stock options timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our executive officers including our neos that are part of the compensation packages for those executive officers for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance share units and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent option exercise prices we have not granted stock options to our executive officers for several years and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances if and when we grant stock options the exercise price is and will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible by our company unless it is performance based the cngc considers the deductibility of the compensation paid to our neos when designing and approving executive compensation a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos is intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under section m however there is no guarantee that any element will actually qualify for deductibility in addition to maintain flexibility to compensate our executive officers in a manner designed to promote our long term goals and objectives the cngc has not adopted a policy that all compensation must be deductible or have the most favorable tax or accounting treatment available to our company rather in certain circumstances the cngc may determine that it is in the best interests of our company to award a particular form of compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all or a portion of that compensation under federal tax laws proxy statement back to contents do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos our neos and other executive officers are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo with the exception of mr cheesewright each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his or her violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under our agreement with mr cheesewright we would pay him an amount equal to one year base salary plus the value of health and dental care for one year under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period or a one year period in the case of mr cheesewright following his or her termination of employment he or she will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment for purposes of these agreements a competing business generally means any retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by walmart with annual revenues in excess of certain thresholds these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company we do not have any contracts or other arrangements with our neos that provide for payments or other benefits upon a change in control of our company see potential payments upon termination or change in control beginning on page for more information what types of retirement and other benefits are our neos eligible to receive our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation matching plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our k plan with the exception of mr cheesewright who has an interest in pension plans related to his prior employment with our u k subsidiary our neos do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan mr cheesewright is not eligible for further contributions to these u k pension plans does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or non payment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our mip and our stock incentive plan both provide that we will recoup awards to the extent required by walmart policies furthermore our mip provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our global statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the participant must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance share units in addition both the mip and the stock incentive plan provide that all awards under these plans whether or not previously paid or deferred will be subject to the companys policies and applicable law regarding clawbacks in effect from time to time proxy statement back to contents are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of our stock yes our senior executives have been subject to stock ownership guidelines since in june our board strengthened the stock ownership guidelines applicable to our ceo and senior officers as follows our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to seven times his current annual base salary and our other neos and certain other senior officers must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to five times his or her current annual base salary the ceo and other senior officers must satisfy these stock ownership guidelines no later than the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to a position covered by the stock ownership guidelines if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than of any shares that vest pursuant to any equity award until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines further as noted below any shares that have been pledged will not be counted when determining whether the officer is in compliance with the guidelines currently each of our neos is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines as illustrated by the following graph assumes a stock price of share which was the closing price of a share on april includes shares that have vested and been deferred does not include shares that have not yet vested or shares underlying options due to their recent promotions mr cheesewright and mr foran have not yet reached their required compliance dates under our stock ownership guidelines we expect that mr cheesewright and mr foran will satisfy their stock ownership requirements by their required compliance dates are there any restrictions on the ability of our neos to engage in transactions involving walmart stock yes our insider trading policy contains the following restrictions our directors and executive officers may trade in our stock only during open window periods and then only after they have pre cleared transactions with our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not enter into trading plans pursuant to sec rule b without having such plans pre approved by our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in hedging transactions such as swaps puts and calls collars and similar financial instruments that would eliminate or limit the risks and rewards of walmart stock ownership our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell options puts or calls whether exchange traded or otherwise or engage in any other transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan before using walmart stock as collateral for any other borrowing our directors and executive officers must satisfy the following requirements the pledging arrangement must be pre approved by walmarts corporate secretary and any walmart shares pledged will not be counted when determining whether the director or executive officer is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines currently none of our independent directors or executive officers has any pledging arrangements in place involving walmart stock one outside director has pledged shares representing less than of his sole and shared beneficial ownership of shares as security for a line of credit as disclosed on page under holdings of officers and directors proxy statement back to contents risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally including any risks that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share units portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share unit program we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our performance based incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures namely operating income based measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure e g sales growth to the detriment of performance under another measure e g return on investment for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our operating income resulting increases in performance share unit payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts the cngc regularly reviews the mix and weightings of the performance measures used in our incentive compensation programs and has concluded that they provide appropriate incentives to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation and return on investment maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share unit program are capped at and of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe motivate our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold our executive officers annual cash incentive payments are subject to reduction or elimination if certain compliance objectives are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our global statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company compensation committee

mitigate any risk that an executive officer would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single performance measure company segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as a whole in the cda we discuss why we believe the compensation of our neos for fiscal properly reflected our companys performance in fiscal the cda also describes feedback we received

incentive plan of we are seeking shareholder approval of the wal mart stores inc stock incentive plan of the stock incentive plan in accordance with the nyse listed company rules which generally requires shareholder approval of all material revisions to equity compensation plans and also for purposes of section m of the internal revenue code in order for certain compensation to be considered performance based and therefore deductible under section m of the internal revenue code material terms of the potential performance goals measures applicable to that compensation must be approved by shareholders at least every five years for purposes of section m of the internal revenue code the material terms of the performance goals that we are asking you to approve consist of i the individuals eligible to receive compensation ii a description of the business criteria performance measures on which the performance goals are based and iii the maximum amount of compensation that could be paid to any individual approval of this proposal will constitute approval of the material terms of the performance criteria as summarized below our shareholders last approved our equity compensation plan and the material terms of its potential performance measures in equity awards are an important component of our overall compensation programs because equity awards help us attract and retain talented associates and non management directors and they help align the interests of award recipients with the interests of our shareholders on february upon the recommendation of the cngc the board approved the adoption of the stock incentive plan subject to shareholder approval at the annual shareholders meeting the proposed stock incentive plan would amend restate and rename the stock incentive plan and would include additional criteria by which performance based awards of cash or stock may be measured and would otherwise amend the stock incentive plan as described below your proxy holder will vote your shares for approval of the stock incentive plan unless you instruct otherwise if approved the stock incentive plan will be the primary vehicle used by our board or the appropriate committees of the board to grant equity awards to participating associates and non management directors if the stock incentive plan is not approved by our shareholders the stock incentive plan would remain in effect and available for additional grants however walmart might not be entitled to take the full tax deduction for awards issued under the plan furthermore if the stock incentive plan is not approved the board or the appropriate committees of the board would not be permitted to take advantage of the additional performance criteria upon which performance based awards could be granted in addition to the points discussed above and the material changes described below we urge you to consider the following information when evaluating this proposal no additional shares we are not asking shareholders to approve any additional shares for issuance under the stock incentive plan we have not sought shareholder approval for additional shares under any equity incentive plans since low burn rates our three year average burn rate is approximately significantly lower than many of our peers share repurchase offsets dilution historically our company has generally purchased more shares through its share repurchase program than it has issued under its equity incentive plans equity awards broadly distributed we grant equity awards to a broad range of associates at all levels of management during

closings shares are not recycled walmart does not recycle shares that are used to pay tax withholding or exercise prices or otherwise reacquired by the company after issuance except in the case of award forfeitures during a vesting period the stock incentive plan comports to this longstanding practice and removes provisions that would allow shares to be recycled in certain circumstances lower cap for awards to non management directors the stock incentive plan includes a cap on the value of shares that can be granted to a non management director in a single year awards to non management directors under the stock incentive plan are subject to the same cap as awards to executive officers and other associates we are not making any changes to our non management director compensation program at this time hedging prohibited while walmarts insider trading policy already prohibits hedging transactions involving shares options and other derivative securities the stock incentive plan also prohibits the hedging of most awards clawback recoupment the stock incentive plan expands the scope of the recoupment provisions to apply to any associate who engages in acts detrimental to walmart with a month look back that now applies to all associates the stock incentive plan amends and restates the stock incentive plan in a number of other ways that we do not believe are material

possible state local or foreign tax consequences the grant of a stock option or a stock appreciation right is not intended to have immediate tax consequences for the grantee or walmart upon exercising a non qualified stock option the recipient will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock acquired and the stock option exercise price and walmart will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount in general if applicable holding period requirements are satisfied the recipient will have no taxable income upon the exercise of an incentive stock option except that the alternative minimum tax may apply and walmart will have no deduction if applicable requirements are satisfied the grantee of an incentive stock option will recognize capital gain or loss on sale or similar disposition of the shares after exercise with respect to an incentive stock option walmart will have a deduction if the shares are

recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or fair market value of shares or a combination of cash and shares received and walmart will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount with respect to

award vests or becomes transferable and walmart will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount the stock incentive plan and its administration are intended to avoid adverse tax consequences under section a of the internal revenue code awards may but need not be structured to be exempt from the limit on deductibility under section m of the internal revenue code the foregoing provides only a general description of the application of u s federal income tax laws to certain types of awards under the stock incentive plan because of the variety of awards that may be made under the stock incentive plan and the complexities of the tax laws grantees of awards under the stock incentive plan should consult a tax advisor about their individual circumstances the board recommends that the shareholders vote for the approval of the stock incentive plan proxy statement back to contents shareholder proposals our company has received notice of the intention of shareholders to present five separate proposals for voting at the annual shareholders meeting the text of the shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received by our company some shareholder proposals and supporting statements may contain assertions about walmart that we believe are incorrect and we have not tried to refute all such inaccuracies in the companys responses all statements contained in a shareholder proposal and its supporting statements are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to wal mart stores inc c o gordon y allison vice president and general counsel corporate division southwest th street bentonville arkansas the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals for the reasons set forth in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors board to adopt a policy policy that walmart will disclose annually whether walmart in the previous fiscal year recouped any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or caused a senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as a result of a determination that the senior executive breached a company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the interests of or detrimental to walmart for purposes of this proposal senior executive includes a former senior executive the policy should provide that the general circumstances of the recoupment or forfeiture will be described the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind described above occurred in the previous fiscal year a statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture required by law or regulation supporting statement as long term shareholders we believe that compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation we believe disclosure of the application of recoupment forfeiture provisions would encourage ethical conduct and appropriate risk management at walmart by educating senior executives about behavioral expectations while discouraging future costly compliance violations by communicating concrete consequences for misconduct walmart has mechanisms in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon a finding of misconduct walmarts management incentive plan mip provides that the compensation nominating and governance committee committee may recoup all incentive compensation whether or not previously paid or deferred awarded in the previous months if the committee determines that the recipient engaged in any act deemed inimical to the best interests of walmart or failed to comply with walmarts policies mip sections b and c similarly the stock incentive plan sip provides for forfeiture of outstanding awards and repayment of amounts received in respect of certain plan awards in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to walmarts best interests sip section separation agreements with several recently retired senior executives state that walmart may suspend and recoup payments made under any agreement with the executive if a failure on the executives part to abide by walmarts statement of ethics is discovered walmart never has disclosed whether these recoupment forfeiture provisions have been applied making it difficult for shareholders to hold members of the committee accountable for administering the provisions as of q walmart has incurred million in costs associated with investigations into alleged foreign corrupt practices act violations in mexico china india and brazil k and q q it was recently reported that questionable accounting and unauthorized sales practices camouflaged poor results at walmarts retail business in china for several years http www bloomberg com news wal mart report found profit boosted by china maneuvers html recoupment disclosure would allow shareholders to determine whether walmart recouped compensation from any current or former senior executive for similar misconduct proxy statement back to contents walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal because of walmarts existing comprehensive recoupment policies and practices as well as existing sec disclosure rules which already require sufficient disclosures when the company enforces its recoupment policies against neos the board and our management believe compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation plans offer letters and other agreements numerous terms and conditions that give us broad rights to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to associates or former associates who have engaged in misconduct we believe these recoupment rights are broader than those provided to the boards and management of many companies and reflect walmarts strong commitment to ethics and integrity walmarts broad existing recoupment rights include the following each of which is noted in the proposal our management incentive plan states that a participant must have complied with walmarts policies including our statement of ethics at all times in order to be eligible to receive a cash incentive payment moreover a participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the cngc determines within twelve months of its payment that prior to the awards payment the participant violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts inimical to the best interests of the company our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of the company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance share units the stock incentive plan additionally provides that a participant must reimburse the company if the cngc determines that the participant at any time up to one year after the receipt of an equity award violated any of our policies breached any restrictive covenants or confidentiality obligations or otherwise committed acts inimical to the best interests of the company when an executive officer leaves walmart we generally enter into a separation agreement that states t he associate acknowledges that the associate has complied with the applicable statement of ethics during the associates employment the discovery of a failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle walmart to suspend and recoup any payments paid or due under this agreement or any other agreements between the parties our statement of ethics among other directives forbids all associates from being dishonest acting illegally and having conflicts between the associates work and personal affairs walmart and the board are committed to pursuing recoupment actions when appropriate against current and former associates believed to have acted unethically we already are required by sec disclosure requirements to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation has been recouped and the amount recouped from our neos moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation policies and compensation decisions regarding the neos we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the reasons for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be recovered further decisions to disclose information taking into account applicable legal requirements the desire of investors to receive information confidentiality and commercial considerations and other matters are more properly made on a case by case basis mandating a report would deprive the board of the ability to exercise judgment and discretion with respect to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information as noted above the secs existing disclosure rules already require walmart to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive officers who served during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such individuals meet the secs definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure requirements to all current and former senior executives is warranted in addition recoupment of compensation is not the only sanction that walmart may impose on associates who violate company policies or otherwise act contrary to the best interests of the company for example an associates misconduct may result in his or her immediate termination from the company thus producing the report requested by the proponent which would focus solely on recoupment or forfeiture of incentive or stock compensation could present an incomplete and misleading picture of the full range of the companys alternatives and actions to penalize and deter associate misconduct in sum the board believes that this proposal is unnecessary because existing sec disclosure rules already require sufficient disclosures regarding walmarts comprehensive recoupment policies and practices and because the report requested by the proposal would not include the full range of sanctions used by walmart to address associate misconduct for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no proxy access for shareholders resolution shareholders ask the wal mart stores inc wmt board to the fullest extent permitted by law to amend our governing documents to allow shareholders to make board nominations as follows the company proxy statement form of proxy and voting instruction forms shall include listed with the boards nominees alphabetically by last name nominees of any party of one or more shareholders that have collectively held continuously for three years at least three percent of the companys securities eligible to vote for the election of directors board members and officers of the company may not be members of any such nominating party of shareholders parties nominating under these provisions may collectively make nominations numbering up to of the companys board of directors preference will be shown to groups holding the greatest number of the companys shares for at least three years nominees may include in the proxy statement a word supporting statement each proxy statement or special meeting notice to elect board members shall include instructions for nominating under these provisions fully explaining all legal requirements for nominators and nominees under federal law state law and the companys governing documents supporting statement the right of shareholders to nominate board candidates is fundamental to good corporate governance and board accountability long term owners of the company should have a meaningful voice in nominating and electing directors this proposal adopts popular and year eligibility thresholds limiting shareholder nominated candidates to means control remains with board nominees our companys share price has substantially underperformed the sp during the latest one two five and ten year time periods rather than independent directors we need directors who are dependent on and accountable to the shareholders who elect them cfa institutes proxy access in the united states revisiting the proposed sec rule download at http www cfapubs org doi pdf ccb v n found proxy access has the potential to enhance board performance and raise overall us market capitalization by between billion and billion none of the event studies indicate that proxy access reform will hinder board performance proxy access would serve as a useful tool for shareowners in the united states and would ultimately benefit both the markets and corporate boardrooms the council of institutional investors whose members have trillion invested maintains the following policy access to the proxy companies should provide access to management proxy materials for a long term investor or group of long term investors owning in aggregate at least three percent of a companys voting stock to nominate less than a majority of the directors eligible investors must have owned the stock for at least two years company proxy materials and related mailings should provide equal space and equal treatment of nominations by qualifying investors vote to enhance shareholder value proxy access for shareholders proposal proxy statement back to contents walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart remains committed to quality shareholder engagement because it allows the board to understand and consider the viewpoints of our shareholders during fiscal in addition to our regular conversations with the investment community we held meetings with a number of significant shareholders and leading proxy advisory firms to discuss issues of interest to our shareholders including governance matters management informs the cngc about these ongoing discussions and the issues of interest raised by our shareholders we recognize that proxy access is a topic of growing interest to members of the investment community who share a sincere interest in ensuring the appropriate composition of company boards however we do not believe the adoption of this proposal is the right approach for walmart the cngc is comprised entirely of independent non management directors and it regularly reviews the composition of the board and board committees as well as the skills and qualifications of our current board members throughout each year the cngc engages in ongoing and extensive board succession planning the cngc often also seeks advice and input from a prominent director search consultant firm this ongoing process is designed to identify and nominate director candidates who possess a diverse and complementary mix of skills and professional experience necessary to oversee our complex global business and who can contribute to the overall effectiveness of our board it also permits the cngc and the board to evaluate the thoughtful and timely periodic refreshment of the composition of the board proxy access can interrupt and undermine the role of the cngc to guide this critical governance process while our shareholders ultimately might reject a director candidate in a politicized board election process which can be initiated at virtually no cost to a nominating shareholder the resulting cost to the company and disruption for the cngc the board and management would be meaningful and therefore would not be in our shareholders short or long term interests shareholders already have the ability to recommend director candidates by means of the processes identified in our governance documents and described in this proxy statement each director candidate recommended by a shareholder pursuant to this process is submitted to the cngc and the cngc evaluates all shareholder recommended candidates on the same basis as all other director candidates over the years our board has embraced a variety of progressive governance practices which provide an appropriate balance between ensuring the boards accountability to shareholders and enabling the board to provide effective oversight and strategic direction for the long term benefit of all shareholders for example each member of the board is elected annually and serves for a one year term currently of the members of our board are independent and of the board members are non management directors board members have full access to the companys officers associates and outside advisors the independent directors annually appoint the lead independent director whose role and responsibilities have been expanded recently shareholders holding or more of walmarts outstanding shares may request special shareholders meetings and there are no supermajority voting requirements for matters presented for a shareholder vote therefore the board believes our corporate governance policies and the measures employed by the cngc for the nomination and election of directors have led to a board that is responsive to shareholder input and promotes a strategy of long term value creation for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no report on greenhouse gas emissions from international marineshipping resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors to set quantitative goals based on current technologies for reducing total greenhouse gas ghg emissions produced by the international marine shipping of products sold in walmarts stores and clubs and report to shareholders by december at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information regarding the goals and the steps walmart plans to take to achieve them supporting statement scientific consensus exists that the climate is warming and that human activity primarily the emission of ghgs is causing it marine shipping is one such activity and its emissions include climate warming co and black carbon and disease causing sulfur oxides total fossil fuel related co emissions attributable to transportation rose by between and http www internationaltransportforum org pub pdf ghgtrends pdf the international maritime organization estimates that marine

ghg emissions from aviation and marine shipping http www c es org docuploads aviation and marine report pdf the pew report estimates that ghg emissions from marine vessels can be reduced more than id at however reduction of emissions from international transportation may be hard to achieve through regulation because it is difficult to attribute emissions to particular countries walmart has set an overall ghg emissions reduction goal for its supply chain but it has not set a goal for reducing marine shipping emissions walmart is the largest importer of ocean containers with teus in and that number has more than doubled over the past years given that a material portion of walmarts cost of goods is spent on imports transported via ship fuel price increases or regulations on ocean emissions could impact financial performance walmart does not disclose ghg emissions from its international marine shipping activities it does estimate emissions from all upstream transportation and distribution which includes marine shipping trucking air freight and rail freightin its carbon disclosure project report it produces this estimate for emissions from all upstream transportation and distribution primarily using data collected from its third party logistics coordinators and epa emission factors only of emissions are from primary data we believe methodologies used by some other retailers are more robustfor example marks and spencer uses primary data for its upstream transportation and distribution emissions estimate kering formerly ppr discloses marine shipping emissions using a methodology verified by independent auditors walmart can improve the quality of its environmental impact analysis and better manage risks associated with climate change by setting a specific goal for reducing emissions associated with shipping its products internationally we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal proxy statement back to contents walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart is known for being highly efficient with resources and that holds true when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions as a recognized corporate leader in the area of global ghg emission reductions see https www cdp net cdpresults cdp sp leaders report pdf walmart understands the objective of the proposal for seven consecutive years walmart has reduced our scope and carbon intensity and we believe we are on track to hold our absolute emissions flat over this decade despite our companys continued growth we also believe our current programs initiatives and partnerships have been evaluated and selected carefully by management to maximize the impact our company can have in contributing to the worldwide reduction of ghg emissions therefore we do not believe the adoption of this proposal is appropriate for walmart at this time the companys achievements in global climate stewardship are a testament to the collective actions that our associates and external partners take to operate more efficiently and more sustainably our current programs initiatives and partnerships which are described in more detail in our most recent global responsibility report have been guided by research to identify the greatest sources of ghg emissions in our business and supply chain which allows us to focus our efforts on those areas where our initiatives can have the greatest impact in evaluating these initiatives we consider the scale of potential impact we can have on ghg emissions as well as our ability to influence that impact in a meaningful way for example according to the world shipping council maritime shipping is the worlds most carbon efficient form of transporting goods with a ghg footprint that is less than half of rail and less than one fifth of trucking see http www worldshipping org industry issues environment air emissions carbon emissions in the world shipping council reported a total of million twenty foot equivalent units teus were moved in the global market see http www worldshipping org about the industry global trade trade statistics by comparison the teus cited in this proposal represents approximately of the total number of containers moved in the market therefore in the area of transportation related ghg emissions our efforts have focused primarily on trucking because of its larger impact and our greater ability to influence that area our efforts are showing results we recently announced we are of the way to our goal of doubling efficiency and we remain committed to these efforts walmart includes efficiency and sustainability related criteria along with other business relevant measures e g on time shipping costs etc in our evaluation of maritime and other carriers however our ability to directly influence ghg emissions produced by international marine shipment of products is limited by the number of cargo carriers who can accurately track and report their ghg emissions therefore walmart participates in the clean cargo working group along with other companies who collectively are engaged on this topic and who already are focused on more sustainable shipping the clean cargo working group is a global business to business initiative made up of leading cargo carriers and their customers and it is dedicated to environmental performance improvement in marine container transport walmart was one of the initial proponents of supply chain ghg emissions reporting furthermore over the last three years we have increased the number of our suppliers who are requested to participate in the carbon disclosure projects reporting process the response rate has increased every year and most recently included over suppliers given the framework and priorities outlined above the board believes management and specifically our subject matter experts who are more familiar with the worldwide logistics supply chain is best situated to make prudent decisions affecting our business and to evaluate how best to leverage our companys ability to influence the reduction of ghg emissions globally we believe walmart can best address the effect of ghg emissions on climate change by continuing to monitor and report on our current comprehensive sustainability initiatives and regularly communicating our progress as we have done for the prior seven years for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no request for annual report regarding incentive compensationplans resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors the board to adopt a policy that the compensation nominating and governance committee the committee will annually analyze and report to shareholders at reasonable expense and omitting proprietary information on whether walmarts incentive compensation plans and programs considered together provide appropriate incentives to discourage senior executives from making investments that result in declining rates of return on investment roi taking into account the following over the previous three years the relationship between growth in invested capital and growth in operating income oi trends in roi the relationship between same store sales growth also known as comparable store sales and total sales growth adjustments made to walmarts reported results in connection with the measurement of performance for incentive plans and the extent to which sales at stores open for more than one year declined because of sales at newly opened stores cannibalization rate supporting statement as walmart employees and long term shareholders we believe that incentive compensation programs for senior executives should encourage sustainable value creation we are concerned that recent decisions by the committee may overemphasize sales growth even when that growth results in declining rates of roi and in some cases does not produce returns that cover the cost of capital specifically the replacement of same store sales growtha metric walmart has repeatedly touted as critically importantwith total sales growth as the sales metric under walmarts performance share program risks encouraging senior executives to invest in new stores even if doing so leads to cannibalization of existing stores sales and lower roi during the last five fiscal years revenue at the walmart us division grew by about but comparable store sales declined during that period invested capital grew at more than twice the rate of oi growth reinforcing our concerns we estimate that during this period the rate of cannibalizationthe percentage of new store sales which cannibalized existing wmt us and sams club salesaveraged above walmart has asserted that the use of oi growth for the annual incentive plan balances the sales and roi metrics used in the long term plan yet the fy addition of sales growth to the annual plan weakens this claim walmart adjusts the oi measure to ensure that our incentive plans reward underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives proxy statement at these adjustments have in all but one of the past five years resulted in increases in the oi metric used to award performance in fy executives benefited from an upward adjustment for the lost sales attributed to cuts in the federal food stamp program even after executives had publicly downplayed any potential impact presumably adjusting the business to minimize the impact of these cuts would have been well within the control of walmart executives we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no we understand shareholder interest in the structure of our annual cash incentive plan and the long term performance share component of our stock incentive plan in response to this increasing shareholder interest we provided additional information in the cda this year regarding the goal setting process and adjustments made for purposes of our incentive plans in keeping with our pay for performance philosophy and as discussed in more detail in the cda included in this proxy statement our approach is designed to focus our leadership and balance short term performance and long term strategic priorities moreover payouts under our compensation plans have been closely aligned with our operating results return on investment roi is a key performance measure used in determining the amount of compensation our neos receive through our incentive plans roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with short term impacts generally our objective for a fiscal year is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at a faster rate than net sales on occasion the company may make strategic investments that may at times cause our operating expenses to grow at a faster rate than net sales and that may result in our operating income growing at a slower rate than net sales as described in our public filings changes in our roi often are attributedto foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and continued proxy statement back to contents investments in ecommerce store growth acquisitions andproperty and equipment strategic investments are not always limited to stores and clubs but also the associates who are responsible for delivering superior customer experiences in our stores and clubs for example in february we announced investments of over billion during fiscal for comprehensive changes to our compensation and training programs the importance of roi performance to our neos total compensation is described in the narrative in the cda in this proxy statement and is clearly depicted in charts included in the cda approximately of our neos total direct compensation for fiscal was based on achieving specified performance targets related to roi sales operating income gross merchandise value or a combination of these metrics this approach also is reflected in the performance based total direct compensation reported for our neos over the prior five fiscal years even a slight fluctuation in roi performance can lead to a meaningful reduction in our neos performance share based incentive compensation as explained in the cda we fell short of our target roi goal for fiscal under our long term incentive plan this resulted in each of our neos falling short of target performance under the performance share program in fiscal further because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only does this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but it will also impact our neos performance share payouts for fiscal years and as well the cngc is responsible for establishing and verifying the attainment of performance goals under our performance based incentive compensation plans the members of the cngc discharge this responsibility with a high degree of care and professionalism reviewing executive compensation and incentive compensation matters at multiple meetings throughout the year through its regular review and approval of the performance measures applicable to performance based compensation the cngc already analyzes whether our incentive compensation programs appropriately incentivize our senior executives to achieve our strategic priorities including the strategic priority of returns this year the cngc again concluded that the design of our performance based incentive compensation programs strikes an appropriate balance between rewarding both annual and long term performance and mitigates the risk that our senior executives will make decisions that overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of the company as a whole moreover the cngcs independent compensation consultant conducted an analysis of the correlation betweenthe performance metrics used in our executive compensation program and total shareholder return and concluded that these metrics support value creation for our shareholders furthermore our shareholders have an adequate opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of the companys incentive compensation plans and programs by means of the annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our neos the cngc via the cdas included in the companys annual proxy statements also already reports to shareholders on an annual basis regarding the relationship between our incentive compensation programs and the companys roi performance and how the companys roi performance may have a meaningful impact on the amount of compensation our neos receive commensurate with its responsibilities the cngc continues to analyze whether the performance measures used in our incentive compensation programs properly incentivize our senior executives to achieve the companys strategic priorities in light of our evolving business strategy and consistent with the rules and regulations of the sec the cngcs analyses of our incentive compensation programs will continue to be reported to shareholders in our annual proxy statements because the cngc already regularly analyzes whether our incentive compensation programs provide proper incentives to our neos to achieve our companys strategic priorities including roi and because our shareholders already receive annual reports on those matters in the cdas in our annual proxy statements we believe the adoption of the policy requested by the proposal is unnecessary duplicative of practices already followed by the cngc and our company and would result in an expenditure of walmarts resources and our managements and directors time that ultimately would not be in our shareholders best interests for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no independent chairman policy resolved the stockholders of wal mart stores inc the company ask the board of directors to adopt a policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be a director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these purposes a director shall not be considered independent if during the last three years he or she was affiliated with a company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or a significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had a personal service contract s with the company or its senior management was affiliated with a company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or of its gross annual revenues from the company had a business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under the securities and exchange commission regulations has been employed by a public company at which an executive officer of the company serves as a director had a relationship of the sort described above with any affiliate of the company and was a spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person described above the policy should be implemented without violating any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if a current chairman ceases to be independent between annual shareholder meetings compliance with the policy may be excused if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement the board of directors led by its chairman is responsible for protecting shareholders long term interests by providing independent oversight of management including the chief executive officer in directing the corporations affairs this oversight can be diminished when the chairman is not independent an independent chairman who sets agendas priorities and procedures for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and ensure the objective functioning of an effective board we view the alternative of a lead outside director even one with a robust set of duties as adequate only in exceptional circumstances fully disclosed by the board recent developments including ongoing investigations into bribery and corruption at the companys subsidiaries in mexico china brazil and india new revelations of accounting fraud at the companys china operations a recent ruling by a national labor relations board administrative law judge against the company for its illegal discipline of employees and the nlrb decision to authorize a nationwide complaint against the company for violations of the national labor relations act highlight the need for enhanced oversight of wal marts corporate culture and behavior a board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change several respected institutions recommend chair independence calpers corporate core principles and guidelines state that the independence of a majority of the board is not enough the leadership of the board must embrace independence and it must ultimately change the way in which directors interact with management we urge you to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart has always strived to maintain high corporate governance standards in keeping with this goal and unlike many other companies in the fortune the board has separated the roles of chairman and ceo since we believe this separation of roles allows our ceo to focus on managing walmarts complex daily operations we also believe that having a separate chairman focused on oversight and governance matters allows the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have a number of other key corporate governance measures in place to see that our board acts independently of management including the following lead independent director since our board has appointed an independent director to serve as a lead independent director as can be seen in our corporate governance guidelines the lead independent director is appointed annually by the independent members of the board and the responsibilities of the lead independent director include approving board meeting agendas schedules and board meeting related information presiding at meetings of our non management directors and independent directors which are held regularly serving as a liaison between the chairman of the board and the independent directors proxy statement back to contents having the authority to call meetings of directors including separate meetings of the non management directors and independent directors and being available for consultation with major shareholders generally defined as those holding two percent or more of the companys outstanding common stock when appropriate majority independent board currently of the members of our board are independent and of the board members are non management directors board members have full access to the companys officers associates and outside advisors fully independent key board committees all members of the audit committee and the compensation nominating and governance committee are independent the chairs of these committees are heavily engaged in establishing the agenda for each committee meeting walmart has no plans to rely on any of the governance exemptions available to controlled companies under the nyse listed company rules if and when such exemptions may become available to the company annual board and board committee self assessments as required by our corporate governance guidelines the board and each of the board committees evaluate their organization leadership structure and processes each year to see that the board and board committees are functioning effectively our chairman has more than years of experience with walmart and is well positioned to provide our ceo with guidance advice and counsel regarding walmarts business operations and strategy moreover our chairmans significant ownership stake in our company provides unparalleled alignment with the interests of his fellow shareholders we believe the corporate governance measures noted above demonstrate that our board has embraced independence and our shareholders have recognized the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re electing our chairman the lead independent director and other board members each year for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal other matters our company is not aware of any matters that will be considered at the annual shareholders meeting other than the matters described in this proxy statement if any other matters are properly brought before the annual shareholders meeting the proxy holders will vote the shares as to which they hold proxies in their discretion proxy statement back to contents questions and

outstanding and entitled to vote as of the record date for the meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy for business to be transacted at the meeting what vote is required to elect a director at the annual shareholders meeting to be elected in an uncontested election of directors which under our bylaws is an election in which the number of nominees for director is not greater than the number of directors to be elected a director nominee must receive affirmative votes representing a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy at

for director is greater than the number of directors to be elected a director nominee must receive a plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors we expect the election of directors at the annual shareholders meeting to be an uncontested election what happens if a director nominee fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election at the annual shareholders meeting any incumbent director who is a director nominee and who does not receive a majority vote must promptly tender his or her offer of resignation as a director for consideration by the board each director standing for reelection at the annual shareholders meeting has agreed to resign effective upon acceptance of such resignation by the board if he or she does not receive a majority vote the board must accept or reject such resignation within days following certification of the shareholder vote in accordance

his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until the directors earlier death resignation or removal any director nominee who is not an incumbent director and who fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election will not be elected as a director and a vacancy will be left on the board the board in its sole discretion may either fill a vacancy resulting from a director nominee

abstain vote or a broker non vote on the proposals to be voted on at the annual shareholders meeting abstentions a share voted abstain with respect to any proposal is considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal but is not considered a vote cast with respect to that proposal therefore an abstention will not have any effect on the election of directors because

effect of a vote against each of the other proposals broker non votes a broker non vote occurs if your shares are not registered in your name that is you hold your shares in street name and you do not
