regarding non gaap financial measures walmart inc reconciliations of and other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three months endedapril three months ended april

prior year comparable period free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billionand billionfor the three months endedapril and respectively we generated free cash flow of billionfor the three months endedapril which was relatively flat compared to billionfor the three months endedapril free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities three months endedapril dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow adjusted epsadjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three months ended april is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for such period management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance unrealized gains and losses beginning in fiscal year due to a change in u s accounting principles walmart is now required to include unrealized gains and or losses of certain equity investments within net income the company s unrealized gains losses primarily relate to walmart s equity investment in jd com while the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com accordingly management excludes the unrealized jd com investment gains losses when reporting adjusted eps tax reform the sec allows companies to record provisional amounts during a one year measurement period from the u s tax reform enactment date while the company recorded provisional amounts as of january the company adjusts such provisional amounts during fiscal as the company adjusted eps in fiscal for the impact of tax reform for consistency management also excludes any fiscal adjustments to the provisional amounts we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended april by adjusting eps for the following unrealized gains and losses on jd com and adjustment to the provisional amount recorded in q fiscal related to tax reform the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps for the three months ended april three months ended april percent change diluted earnings per share reported eps adjustments pre tax

operating segments for the week period ended april and april in each case calculated by excluding fuel sales for such periods collectively the non gaap comparable sales measures are non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec s rules we believe the most directly comparable financial measures computed in accordance with gaap are the comparable sales calculated by including fuel for the corresponding periods we believe that the presentation of the non gaap comparable sales measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the impact of fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on walmart u s and sam s club s comparable sales for

gaap measures roi we include return on assets roa which is calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap as well as return on investment roi as measures to assess returns on assets management believes roi is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended april and respectively roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended april and respectively the decline in roa was primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating income we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa is as follows walmart inc return on assets and return on investment trailing twelve months trailing twelve months ended ended april april dollars in millions dollars in millions calculation of return on assets calculation of return on investment numerator numerator

certain balance sheet data average total assets average accumulated depreciation total assets and amortization accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable accounts payable average accrued liabilities accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to

performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities three months ended april dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow non gaap measures constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three months ended april three months ended april walmart international consolidated percent

non gaap measures comparable sales measures the comparable sales of the company s walmart u s and sam s club operating segments for the week periods ended april and april in each case calculated by excluding fuel sales for such periods collectively the non gaap comparable sales measures are non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec s rules we believe the most directly comparable financial measures computed in accordance with gaap are the comparable sales calculated by including fuel for the corresponding periods we believe that the presentation of the non gaap comparable sales measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the impact of fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on walmart u s and sam s club s comparable sales for the periods presented non gaap measures comparable sales measures cont the table

ended april and april with fuel without fuel fuel impact weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended walmart u s sam s club non gaap measures adjusted eps adjusted eps adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three months ended april is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for such period management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance unrealized gains and losses beginning in fiscal year due to a change in u s accounting principles walmart is now required to include unrealized gains and or losses of certain equity investments within net income the company s unrealized gains losses primarily relate to walmart s equity investment in jd com while the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com accordingly management excludes the unrealized jd com investment gains losses when reporting adjusted eps tax reform the sec allows companies to record provisional amounts during a one year measurement period from the u s tax reform enactment date while the company recorded provisional amounts as of january the company adjusts such provisional amounts during fiscal as the company adjusted eps in fiscal for the impact of tax reform for consistency management also excludes any fiscal adjustments to the provisional amounts non gaap measures adjusted eps we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended april by adjusting eps for the following unrealized gains and losses on jd com and adjustment to the provisional amount recorded in q fiscal related to tax reform the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps for the three months
