financial measures wal mart stores inc reconciliations of and other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billionand billionfor the six months endedjuly and respectively the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital management including significant inventory improvement and timing of payments free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities six months endedjuly dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions if any until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions the table below reflects the

comparable sam s club sales measuresthe comparable club sales of the company s sam s club operating segment sam s club for the week and week periods ended july and july and for the week period ending oct in each case calculated by excluding sam s club s fuel sales for such periods the sam s club comparable sales measures are non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec s rules we believe the sam s club comparable club sales for the historical periods for which the corresponding sam s club comparable sales measures are presented calculated by including fuel sales are the financial measures computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to the respective sam s club comparable sales measures we believe that the presentation of the sam s club comparable sales measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of the fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on sam s club s comparable club sales for the periods presented adjusted epsthe adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three month period ended july is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because the adjusted eps excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for the three month period ended july management believes that the adjusted eps for the three month period ended july is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance for the three month period ended july and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated the adjusted eps for the three month period ended july by adjusting the eps for the amount of the impact of the gain of net of tax from the sale of yihaodian in china adjusted eps for the three months ended july is a non gaap financial

net income per share adjusted eps adjustment gain from the sale of yihaodian in china net of tax eps forecasted adjusted eps forecasted adjusted eps is also considered a non gaap financial measure management believes that forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for fiscal performance to the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmart s core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal by adjusting forecasted eps for the amount of the impact of the gain of net of tax from the sale of yihaodian in china forecasted adjusted eps fiscal fiscal diluted net income

related expenses to range between and million these are included in our corporate and support expenses non gaap measures roi management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was percent and percent for the trailing months ended july and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to our decrease in operating income we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assets trailing twelve months ended trailing twelve months ended july july dollars in millions dollars in millions calculation of return on investment calculation of return on assets numerator numerator operating income consolidated net income interest income denominator depreciation and amortization average total assets rent return on assets roa adjusted operating income as of july denominator certain balance sheet data average total assets total assets average accumulated depreciation and amortization accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable accounts payable average accrued liabilities accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by non gaap measures free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billion and billion for the six months ended july and respectively the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital management including significant inventory improvement and timing of payments free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities six months ended july dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations related to acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods non gaap measures constant currency the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates we refer to the results of the calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we report constant currency operating results we are reporting operating results without the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions if any until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmarts underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total

comparable club sales for the week and week periods ended july and sams clubs projected comparable club sales for the week period ending october in each case calculated by excluding sams clubs fuel sales for such periods are non gaap financial measures we believe the sams club net sales and operating income for the quarter ended july the percentage changes in those financial measures from the prior year period sams clubs comparable club sales for the week and week periods ended july and sams clubs projected comparable club sales for the week period ending october in each case calculated by including sams clubs fuel sales for such period are respectively the financial measures computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to the non gaap financial measures described above we believe that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures with respect to sams club described above provides useful information to investors regarding walmarts financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of the fuel sales of sams club which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on sams clubs net sales and

share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three month period ended july is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules because the adjusted eps excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for the three month period ended july management believes that the adjusted eps for the three month period ended july is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management considers walmarts core earnings performance for the three month period ended july and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have

addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmarts core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed
