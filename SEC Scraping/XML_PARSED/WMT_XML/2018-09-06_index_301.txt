corporations cfcs must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs u s shareholder due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules the company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the long term effects of this provision therefore the company has not yet recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to gilti in the condensed consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti or use the period cost method the company has however included an estimate of the current gilti impact in the annual effective tax

instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies subsequent to entering into derivative transactions the company regularly monitors the

depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings the company s net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been and is not expected to be significant instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge

formats including supercenters supermarkets hypermarkets warehouse clubs including sam s clubs and cash carry overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u s primarily because of its merchandise mix walmart international is our second largest segment and has grown in recent years by adding retail wholesale and other units and expanding ecommerce sam s club

provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the company s segments using each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment s operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in fiscal the company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations to the operating segments and accordingly revised prior period amounts for comparability comparable store and club sales or comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubsby measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmart s definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as ecommerce sales we measure the ecommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications including omni channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store s retail square feet of more than five percent additionally sales related to ecommerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for months comparable sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing our operating results we use the term currency exchange rates to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future table of contentsthe retail industrywe operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as ecommerce businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates cybersecurity attacks and unemployment company performance metricswe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate we define our financial framework as strong efficient growth operating discipline andstrategic capital allocation as we execute on this financial framework we believe our returns on capital will improve over time strong efficient growthour objective of prioritizing strong efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable store and club sales and accelerating ecommerce sales growth while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the long term growth of the company comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including ecommerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases calendar comparable sales as well as the impact of fuel for the three and six months ended july were as follows three months ended july six months ended july with fuelfuel impactwith fuelfuel impactwalmart u s sam s club total u s comparable sales in the u s including fuel increased and for the three and six months ended july respectively when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year total u s comparable sales were driven by strong comparable sales growth at both the walmart u s and sam s club segments the walmart u s segment had growth of and for the three and six months ended july respectively driven by ticket and traffic growth and aided by warmer weather in the second quarter for the three and six months ended july the walmart u s segment s ecommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales by approximately and respectively comparable sales at the sam s club segment were and for the three and six months ended july respectively driven by strong traffic which is partially due to transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs the increase in comparable sales at the sam s club segment was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales the sam s club segment s ecommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales by approximately for both the three and six months ended july table of contentsoperating disciplinewe operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating expenses three months ended july six months ended july amounts in millions except unit counts net sales percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expenses percentage change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three and six months ended july we leveraged operating expenses which decreased and basis points as a percentage of net sales when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage was walmart u s strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements that more than offset investments in ecommerce and technology strategic capital allocationwe are allocating more capital to store remodels ecommerce technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings when compared to prior years this allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping the following table provides additional detail amounts in millions six months ended july allocation of capital expenditures remodels ecommerce technology supply chain and other new stores and clubs including expansions and relocations total u s walmart international total capital expenditures although capital expenditures remained relatively flat in total how we expended capital varied consistent with our shift in capital allocation strategy returnsas we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics in addition we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resourcessection return on assets and return on investment we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets while roi is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roa was and for the trailing twelve months ended july and respectively the decline in roa was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months which was the result of the billion net loss related to the sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil losses on extinguishment of debt in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal losses on our jd com investment and restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal roi was and for the trailing twelve months ended july and respectively the decline in roi was due to the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve months which was primarily driven by the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally an increase in average total assets also contributed to the decline of roi primarily driven by our higher cash balance at july as a result of our recent billion net proceeds from issuance of long term debt and changes in the value of our jd com investment table of contentswe define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows for the trailing twelve months ending july amounts in millions calculation of return on assetsnumeratorconsolidated net income denominatoraverage total assets return on assets roa calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominatoraverage total assets average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi as of

current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by table of contentsfree cash flowfree cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resourcesfor discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in the same period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billionand billionfor the six months endedjuly and respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments partially offset by a decrease in tax payments primarily as a result of the tax reform and jobs act of tax reform we generated free cash flow of billion for the six months ended july which was relatively flat compared to billion for the six months ended july walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities six months ended july amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing
