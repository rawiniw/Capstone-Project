exchange commission a press release the press release that we will issue on may the press release discloses information regarding our results of operations for the three months ended april and our financial condition as of april the press release provides information regarding certain financial measures that may be considered non gaap financial measures each a non gaap measure under the rules of the securities and exchange commission certain of those non gaap measures include financial measures that are presented on a constant currency basis constant currency measures constant currency measures are calculated by translating the results of our international operating segment international for a fiscal period in the local currencies in which international operates into u s dollars using the currency exchange rates for the prior comparable period our total u s comparable store sales and sams clubs comparable club sales for the thirteen week periods ended april and may that are calculated excluding the fuel sales of our sams club operating segment for such periods the press release provides information that reconciles each of these non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures our management believes that presentation of the non gaap measures discussed above provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations as to the periods for which they are presented for the following reasons we are required to translate internationals operating results as stated in local currencies into u s dollars to report our results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles period over period comparisons of our operating results can be affected by the differences between currency exchange rates in the prior fiscal period to which the comparison is made and the currency exchange rates in the current fiscal period as reflected in our operating results reported in u s dollars making an investors assessment of the underlying performance of international and its effect on total company underlying performance for the current fiscal period more difficult the presentation of the constant currency measures permits investors to understand important aspects of internationals underlying performance in the current fiscal period without the effect of any period to period fluctuations in applicable currency exchange rates and how that performance would have affected our results of operations in the current fiscal period and in period over period comparisons had currency exchange rates remained constant since the comparable prior year period our total u s comparable store sales and comparable club sales excluding the fuel sales of our sams club operating

per share data the following information provides reconciliations of non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most nearly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with general accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we ended the quarter with negative free cash flow of billion and positive free cash flow of million for the three months ended april and respectively the first quarters decrease in free cash flow is primarily the result of increased investment in inventory free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the three months ended april and as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by used in financing activities in those periods forthethreemonths endedapril amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities calculation of return on investment and return on assets management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percent and percent for the trailing month periods ended april and respectively the period over period increase in roi is principally due to the improvement in adjusted operating income the timing of our chilean acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in january we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by walmarts management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows forthetwelvemonths endedapril dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of april certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of discontinued operations total assets as of april and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of
