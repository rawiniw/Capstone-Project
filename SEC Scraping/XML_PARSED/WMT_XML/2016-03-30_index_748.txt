overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business change the mix of products we sell to one with a

higher levels of unemployment inflation deflation decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns changes in tax and other laws higher fuel and other energy costs weakness in the local housing market fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other

healthcare laws the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the u s and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results the economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences whether involving physical retail digital retail or the integration of physical and digital retail which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings a critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience and the speed and cost of shipping these factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences including the key factors described above and spending patterns whether for our physical retail offerings digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or through the integration of both areas which could materially adversely affect our financial performance the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store and club sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers and wholesale club operators as well as other national and international internet based retailers and retail intermediaries our walmart u s segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores and hypermarkets as well as e commerce and catalog businesses our sam s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations as well as e commerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs home improvement stores specialty electronics stores apparel stores wholesale clubs cash carry operations convenience stores and e commerce and catalog businesses we compete with such retailers wholesale club operators and e commerce retailers in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise the merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours in store amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications cost and speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online through mobile commerce applications and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance see item business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications if we fail to maintain or grow our overall market position through the integration of our physical retail presence and digital retail our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of retail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for cross store or cross club sales of merchandise that such in store and in club traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments overall operations operational risksnatural disasters changes in climate and geo political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geo political events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur such as superstorm sandy in the u s in or numerous winter storm systems in the u s in and and could adversely affect our financial performance in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily self insured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the u s political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the u s currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the u s s foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our financial performance our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and non food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and non food items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary back up systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical information systems our information systems including our back up systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denial of service attacks security breaches through cyberattacks from cyber attackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our information systems and our back up systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both our information systems and back up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our information systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives if the technology based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our e commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected many of our customers shop with us over our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications including walmart com and samsclub com in the u s and our retail websites in other countries which are a part of our multi channel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multi channel sales strategy we offer walmart pickup and club pickup and in a growing number of locations online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local walmart store or sam s club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs multi channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the u s and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive user friendly e commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of e commerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors that we hold whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers members associates vendors and others could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors we also utilize third party service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers back office support and other functions in addition our online operations at www walmart com www samsclub com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments each year cyber attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we maintain substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to such information and have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our third party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us however we or our third party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which cyber attackers may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers and breach our or our third party service providers information systems during fiscal we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for walmart canada suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of that company s site including some walmart canada customers which we believe has not had a material impact on walmart canada or the company walmart canada discontinued use of this third party service provider sam s club in the united states also used the same third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by walmart canada after the breach in canada sam s club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider once the security review was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider along with a determination that the information of sam s club members was not compromised by the security breach sam s club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the same third party service provider cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers in the future like the incident referenced above and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third party service providers have access and we or our third party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs moreover associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third party service providers security measures and breach our or our third party service providers information systems whether digital or otherwise any breach of our security measures or those of our third party service providers and loss of our confidential information which could be undetected for a period of time or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers and members whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications by accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard pci dss issued by the payment card industry security standards council pci dss contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage processing and transmission of individual cardholder data the payment card industry set october as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept europay mastercard visa emv chip card credit and debit transactions while we already accept many emv cards if we are unable to fully implement emv as planned we may incur increased costs associated with the liability shift by accepting debit cards for payment we are also subject to compliance with the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any disruption results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in addition the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected the wage increases for over associates in our operations in the u s and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the u s that we announced in february and related wage increases for million associates aggregating billion in the year ending january fiscal will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly if we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit achieving decreases in our operating selling general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending january and thereafter our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected we may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the u s which may materially adversely affect our financial performance our expansion strategy in the u s depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the u s and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other store formats and sam s clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local real estate land use zoning and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states including in market areas in which we have no existing operations increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters moreover our expansion in our existing local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level of cannibalization of the sales of existing stores or clubs if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets other small formats or sam s clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be materially adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing walmart international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sam s clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the u s our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our walmart international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve economic business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets which closures impede the growth of our international operations finally some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries making our entry into those markets which may present attractive growth opportunities more difficult if not impossible if we cannot effectively continue to expand our walmart international segment our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our walmart international segment and our future financial performance financial risksfluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations our operations in countries other than the u s are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u s dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the u s from local currencies into u s dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period to period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period over period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period over period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates e commerce growth rates gross margin earnings and earnings per share or new store and club openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies regulatory compliance reputational and other risksour operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance we are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly owned subsidiaries operating in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom our majority owned subsidiaries operating in africa central america and mexico and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in china in addition to our u s operations during fiscal our walmart international operations generated approximately of our consolidated net sales our divisions also source goods and services from other countries the future expansion of our operations in countries outside the u s could result in our international operations accounting for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws anti money laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future in particular brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the company s subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non income tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could materially adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the u s and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the u s additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the u s the various risks inherent in doing business in the u s generally also exist when doing business outside of the u s and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by u s laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u s laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation we are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the u s and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws in addition asda stores ltd asda a wholly owned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in over equal value claims that are pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asda s retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asda s warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking i back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations and ii an increase in the store rate prospectively to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities on january the employment tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation at this time it is undetermined i how many of these claims may ultimately be filed or ii whether the employment tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of test cases determinations made in such test cases if any might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues moreover a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform or who have performed like work in that position on march asda asked the employment tribunal to stay all proceedings contending that the high court which is the superior first instance civil court in the uk that is headquartered in the royal courts of justice in the city of london is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims on march asda also asked the employment tribunal to strike out substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with employment tribunal rules following argument and appellate proceedings the claims have remained in the employment tribunal the issue of stay strike out and the scope of employment tribunal rules are the subject of further appellate proceedings we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption item legal proceedings and in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on going fcpa matter the audit committee of our board of directors which is composed solely of independent directors is conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including wal mart de mxico s a b de c v or walmex and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and or misconduct we are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for fcpa compliance and strengthening our global anti corruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti corruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the u s department of justice the doj and the sec and we have been informed by the doj and the sec that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the fcpa a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmex s current and former officers we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on going government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions and or penalties the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations the shareholder lawsuits or our own internal investigations and review moreover we expect to continue to incur costs incremental to the million of costs incurred in fiscal and the costs incurred in prior years in conducting our on going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers these matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues while we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters given the on going nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future item b

limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment changes may include such activities as implementing new more

construction of leased assets specifically we did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the sale leaseback accounting guidance primarily leases in which we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets which should have resulted in the company being deemed the owner of the

three primary store formats as well as digital retail of our three reportable segments walmart u s has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit rate in addition it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the company s net sales and operating income walmart international consists of our operations outside of the u s and includes retail wholesale and other businesses these businesses consist of numerous formats including supercenters supermarkets hypermarkets warehouse clubs including sam s clubs cash carry home improvement specialty electronics apparel stores drug stores and convenience stores as well as digital retail the overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u s because of its merchandise mix walmart international is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions as well as by adding retail wholesale and other units and expanding digital retail sam s club consists of membership only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail as a membership only warehouse club membership income is a significant component of the segment s operating income sam s club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments each of our segments contributes to the company s operating results differently but each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the company s net sales and operating income in recent years our fiscal year ends on january for our u s and canadian operations we consolidate all other operations generally using a one month lag and on a calendar year basis our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns historically our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january this discussion which presents our results for periods occurring in the fiscal years ended january fiscal january fiscal and january fiscal should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the company s performance additionally the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the company s segments using each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmart s definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as e commerce sales we measure the e commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and our mobile commerce applications and fulfilled through our e commerce distribution facilities as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications but fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from table of contentscomparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store s retail square feet of more than five percent comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing our operating results we use the term currency exchange rates to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future we made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year these reclassifications did not impact the company s operating income or consolidated net income the retail industrywe operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as e commerce and catalog businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees whom we call associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found under item a risk factors in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january and in the discussion under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and information in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january table of contentscompany performance metricswe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the countries in which we operate for several years our performance metrics emphasized three financial priorities growth leverage and returns we are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integration of digital and physical retail these investments support long term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everyday low cost during this time of increased investments we have shifted our financial priorities to focus primarily on growth balanced by the long term health of the company including returns we will continue to grow through new stores and clubs and through increasing comparable store and club sales which include our e commerce sales while leverage remains important to everyday low cost during this time of increased investments operating expenses may grow at a rate that is greater than or equal to the rate of our net sales growth and operating income may grow at a rate that is equal to or less than the rate of our net sales growth our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing working capital to deliver strong free cash flow we will also continue to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends growthwe measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period over period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales we also review the progress of our digital retail investments by measuring the impact e commerce sales have on our comparable store and club sales at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the long term growth of the company these strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales in the near term net salesfiscal years ended january amounts in millions net salespercentof totalpercentchangenet salespercentof totalpercentchangenet salespercentof totalwalmart u s walmart international sam s club net sales our consolidated net sales decreased billionor for fiscal and increased billion or for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year net sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by billionor as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a billiondecrease in fuel sales primarily due to the lower selling prices of fuel at our sam s club segment the negative effect of such factors was offset by year over year growth in retail square feet positive comparable sales in the walmart u s segment and higher e commerce sales across the company the increase in net sales for fiscal was primarily due to year over year growth in retail square feet positive comparable sales in the u s and higher e commerce sales across the company the increase was partially offset by billionof negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal calendar comparable store and club salescomparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar our fiscal calendar comparable store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases calendar comparable store and club sales as well as the impact of fuel for fiscal and were as follows fiscal years ended january with fuelfuel impactwalmart u s sam s club total u s comparable store and club sales in the u s including fuel increased and in fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the fiscal total u s comparable store and club sales were positively impacted table of contentsby continued traffic improvement and higher e commerce sales at the walmart u s segment offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the sam s club segment e commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately and for walmart u s and sam s club respectively for fiscal the fiscal total u s comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by higher traffic during the end of the fiscal year e commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately and for walmart u s and sam s club respectively for fiscal as we continue to add new stores and clubs in the u s we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs to those of nearby non impacted stores and clubs in each case as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened strategic growth investmentsduring fiscal we made capital investments globally of billion these capital investments primarily consisted of payments to add new stores and clubs remodel existing stores and clubs construct distribution centers and invest in technology in addition we made an incremental operational investment of million in e commerce in fiscal as compared to fiscal we also made operational investments of approximately billion in fiscal in connection with the new associate wage structure and comprehensive associate training and educational programs announced in first quarter of fiscal these operational investments will continue into the year ending january fiscal table of contentsreturnswhile we are focused primarily on growth we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced we generate returns by efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital we monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics which we discuss below in addition we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section return on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was and for the fiscal years ended january and respectively the decline in roi was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi table of contentsthe calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows fiscal years ended january

account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of continuing operations were adjusted to reflect the adoption of asu interest imputation of interest subtopic simplifying the presentation of debt issuance cost for all periods table of contentsfree cash flowfree cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated free cash flow of billion billionand billionfor fiscal and respectively the decrease in free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities fiscal years ended january amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in

on our consolidated net sales was partially offset by the year over year growth in retail square feet positive comparable sales in the walmart u s segment and higher e commerce sales across the

improved margins in food general merchandise and consumables in the walmart u s segment positively impacted our gross profit rate changes in the merchandise mix in the walmart international segment and a reduction in low margin fuel sales in the sam s club segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate while continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure at the walmart u s segment negatively impacted our gross profit rate our gross profit rate was relatively flat in fiscal when compared to fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased and basis points for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the walmart u s segment due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve the overall customer experience the approximately billion charge for the store closures announced in january and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to our continued investments in digital retail and higher health care expenses in the u s from increased enrollment in our associate health care plans and medical cost inflation the million impact of wage and hour litigation in the u s as

membership and other income increased and for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades and plus member renewals for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades plus member renewals and an increase in members from the opening of new clubs operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased basis points for fiscal and decreased basis points for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure our continued investments in new clubs digital retail and information technology and the approximately million charge for club closures announced in january for fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to better expense management in a number of areas including the optimization of the new in club staffing structure announced in fiscal which resulted in decreases in wage expense and payroll taxes as a result of the factors discussed above segment operating income was billion billionand billion for fiscal and respectively table of contentsliquidity and capital resourcesliquiditythe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity our cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with our long term debt and short term borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long term growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations finance our global expansion activities pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future net cash provided by operating activitiesfiscal years ended january amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was billion billionand billionfor fiscal and respectively the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations partially offset by improved working capital management the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as the timing of income tax payments in fiscal the company will move forward with the second year of our new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and educational programs which was announced in fiscal we anticipate cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund these programs in fiscal and future years cash equivalents and working capitalcash and cash equivalents were billionand billionat january and respectively our working capital deficit was billionand billionat january and respectively the increase in our working capital deficit reflects the company s efficient leverage achieved through improved working capital management in addition to the timing of payments we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases we use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the u s and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly we intend with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we do not expect local laws other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the u s to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations as of january and january cash and cash equivalents of

short term borrowings to provide funding for our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal the increase in net cash flows provided by short term borrowings partially offset a larger billion decrease in long term debt due within one year for fiscal more cash provided from operating activities combined with less cash used for share

shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status the company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending january we regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases including among other things current cash needs capacity for leverage cost of borrowings our results of operations and the market price of our common stock we anticipate that a significant majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the company s free cash

ended january amounts in millions except per share data total number of shares repurchased average price paid per share total amount paid for share repurchases share repurchases increased billion for fiscal and decreased billion for fiscal respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase in share repurchases resulted from our intention to utilize the current share repurchase authorization over the next two years for fiscal the decrease was a result of cash needs reduced leverage and increased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below table of contentssignificant transactions with noncontrolling interestsas described in note to our consolidated financial statements in july we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in yihaodian our e commerce operations in china for approximately million using existing cash to complete this transaction and during fiscal we completed the purchase of substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in walmart chile for approximately billion using existing cash to complete this transaction capital resourceswe believe cash flows from continuing operations our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures dividend payments and share repurchases we have strong commercial paper and long term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to

as follows rating agencycommercialpaperlong termdebtstandard poor sa aamoody s investors servicep aa fitch ratingsf aacredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the general economic environment conditions in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and changes in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us in addition any downgrade of our current short term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing the credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of

commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included in the table above purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty the expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations in addition to

commitments for land and buildings for approximately future locations these lease commitments have lease terms ranging from to years and provide for certain minimum rentals if leases for all of those future locations had been executed as of february payments under operating leases would increase by millionfor fiscal based on current estimates in connection with certain long term debt issuances we

contentsforeign currency riskwe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the u s for fiscal movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the company s subsidiaries in canada the united kingdom japan mexico and chile were the primary cause of the billionnet loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive income loss we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign currency denominated long term debt as net investment hedges we hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non u s denominated debt the aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of millionat january and in a liability position of millionat january the change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the strengthening of the u s dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal a hypothetical increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at january would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of million a hypothetical change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at january would have resulted in a

which is captioned contingencies and appears elsewhere herein table of contentssummary of critical accounting estimatesmanagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the u s these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements inventorieswe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segment s inventories the inventory at the walmart international segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the first in first out fifo method the retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the inventory at the sam s club segment is valued based on the weighted average cost using the lifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns the retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo we provide for estimated inventory losses or shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales following annual inventory counts the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance such as operating income and cash flows the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level or in certain markets at the market group level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived assets is impaired resulting in a write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative market based approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted table of contentsas of january the fair value of certain indefinite lived intangible assets held in our international segment exceeded its carrying value of million by approximately management will continue to monitor the fair value of these assets in future periods income taxesincome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the u s statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies heavily on estimates table of contentscautionary statement regarding forward looking

continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the

the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company the expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the company s capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result regardless of the significance of the payments accounting standards table of contentscodification leases asc defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis pursuant to asc to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term long lived assetslong lived assets are stated at cost management reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not material goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following table reflects goodwill activity by reportable segment for fiscal and amounts in

the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates in

non financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction the fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the levels of the fair value hierarchy are level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable andlevel unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop its own assumptions recurring fair value measurementsthe company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis the fair values are the estimated amounts the company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates the fair values have been measured using the income approach and level inputs which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency

instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies subsequent to entering into derivative transactions the company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties in connection with various derivative agreements including master netting arrangements the company held cash collateral from counterparties of millionand millionat january and january respectively the company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset furthermore as part of the

activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly the company intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the company s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within the company s foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less

out fifo method the retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the

approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo property and equipmentproperty and equipment are stated at cost gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred costs of major improvements are capitalized while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred the following table summarizes the company s property and equipment balances and

equipment property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal and was billion billion and billion respectively interest costs capitalized on construction projects were million million and million in fiscal and respectively leasesthe company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company the expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the company s capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result regardless of the significance of the payments accounting standards codification leases asc defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis pursuant to asc to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term long lived assetslong lived assets are stated at cost management reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not material goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following table reflects goodwill activity by reportable segment for fiscal and amounts in millions walmartu s walmartinternationalsam sclubtotalbalances as of february changes in currency translation and other acquisitions balances as of january changes in currency translation and other acquisitions balances as of january goodwill recorded for fiscal and acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significant individually or in the aggregate to the company s consolidated financial statements indefinite lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the company s consolidated balance sheets these assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions there were no impairment charges related to indefinite lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal and self insurance reservesthe company self insures a number of risks including but not limited to workers compensation general liability auto liability product liability and certain employee related healthcare benefits standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis the recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments on a regular basis claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third party actuaries to ensure liability estimates are appropriate to limit exposure to some risks the company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions including stop loss insurance coverage for workers compensation general liability and auto liability income taxesincome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases temporary differences deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates in determining the provision for income taxes an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income permanent differences

as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies subsequent to entering into derivative transactions the company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties in connection with various derivative agreements including master netting arrangements the company held cash collateral from counterparties of million and million at january and january respectively the company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the company s net derivative liability position exceeds million with such counterparties the company had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at january and did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at january the company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and accordingly the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings the company s net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges

variable rate interest rate swaps that the company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the company s exposure due to credit loss the company s interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay variable interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed rate debt being hedged the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges changes in the

in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings the hedged items are recognized foreign currency denominated liabilities that are re measured at spot exchange rates each period and the assessment of effectiveness and measurement of any ineffectiveness is based on total changes in the related derivative s cash flows as a result the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re measurement

consolidation investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements are accounted for primarily using the equity method these investments are immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements the company s consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending on january for the united states u s and canadian operations the company consolidates all other operations generally using a one month lag and based on a calendar year there were no significant intervening events during january that materially affected the consolidated financial statements use of estimates policy use of estimatesthe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities management s estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents policy cash and cash equivalentsthe company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents all credit card debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents the amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled billion and billion at january and respectively in addition cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of million and million at

in various locations around the world of the company s billion and billion of cash and cash equivalents at january and respectively billion and billion respectively were held outside of the u s and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the company s non u s operations the company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the u s and anticipates the company s domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by operating activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly the company intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the company s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within the company s foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits the company does not expect local laws other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the u s to have a material effect on the company s overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations as of january and cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the u s due to local laws or other restrictions receivables policy receivablesreceivables are stated at their

walmart u s segment s inventories the inventory at the walmart international segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the first in first out fifo method the retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of

are stated at cost gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred costs of major improvements are capitalized while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred the following table summarizes the company s property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight line basis fiscal years ended january amounts in millions estimated useful lives landn a buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment years transportation equipment years construction in progressn a property and equipment accumulated depreciation property and equipment net leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term lease policy leasesthe company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company the expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the company s capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result regardless of the significance of the payments accounting standards codification leases asc defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis pursuant to asc to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term impairment or disposal of long lived assets policy long lived assetslong lived assets are stated at cost management reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique goodwill and intangible assets policy goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following

consolidated balance sheets these assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions self insurance reserve policy text block self insurance reservesthe company self insures a number of risks including but not limited to workers compensation general liability auto liability product liability and certain employee related healthcare benefits standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis the recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments on a regular basis claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third party actuaries to ensure liability estimates are appropriate to limit exposure to some risks the company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions including stop loss insurance coverage for workers compensation general liability and auto liability income tax policy income taxesincome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases temporary differences deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely
