mcmillon president and ceo wal mart stores inc april walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year building on our progress in fiscal year fy walmart devoted significant resources to build the framework of our enhanced compliance program with the goal of operating a consistent unified program around the globe last years report highlighted several structural changes to the companys compliance function summarized the expansion of walmarts global compliance team and identified areas in which walmart instituted new or improved procedures and systems to promote compliance throughout our business walmarts fy report measured progress against a prioritized list of compliance related enhancements our senior management developed in close coordination with the audit committee of the companys board of directors the objectives reflected careful thinking about how to build a structure that would not only immediately enhance the companys compliance efforts but also enable a cycle of continuous self assessment and improvement in the years to come for fy which ended january senior management again worked with the audit committee to analyze data about the companys risks and develop a list of prioritized objectives to guide the global compliance organizations continuing efforts the work from fy enabled and improved that priority setting process for example in fy the company recruited a number of experts in various disciplines to work in our u s international and ecommerce businesses with these experts in place the process for identifying analyzing and prioritizing compliance risks for fy was even more thorough and informed through this process senior management and the audit committee agreed on compliance objectives to be accomplished during fy as in fy the boards compensation nominating and governance committee cngc conditioned a portion of the compensation for the companys most senior executives on the company making adequate progress in achieving these objectives under the oversight of the audit committee and cngc the company assigned each objective to one or more senior executives to oversee based on which executives areas of authority related to each objective as in fy our senior management reported regularly to the audit committee and cngc on the status of these objectives throughout the year by the conclusion of fy the company completed of the objectives and partially accomplished the remaining two senior management recommended that work on the goals of the remaining two objectives be carried into the current fiscal year in light of these results the audit committee and cngc concluded the company made adequate progress in achieving the objectives and did not elect to exercise the option to reduce our executives compensation for additional discussion of this topic please see pages of our proxy statement just as these annual objectives built on the work we accomplished the year before this report picks up where last years left off it provides an overview of the companys work to develop our compliance program over the last fiscal year through examples of the projects we undertook as we identified selected and worked on the objectives we grouped them into three top level categories people policies and processes and systems and analytics this report follows the same structure walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year people over the last few years our senior executives and compliance professionals have examined the core areas of risk in our business and used that information to focus our compliance program efforts in each of our markets our compliance program addresses at least key subject matters anti corruption antitrust consumer protection the environment financial services compliance food safety health and safety health and wellness international trade labor and employment licenses and permits privacy product safety responsible sourcing each market may add topics to the program based on risks specific to that market once we identified these compliance topics the company in fy hired or named a global subject matter leader in each of these areas to provide top level expertise and to help maintain consistently high standards across our business units the next step accomplished in fy was to hire and realign additional compliance staff to round out our market level compliance teams this process included recruiting additional staff and clearly allocating responsibilities among our compliance teams to address the subject matters in our walmart u s and international businesses it also included developing training programs to ensure our compliance associates apply the latest developments and innovations in their field while these efforts to hire and train within the compliance program improved our capabilities we realize the work of the more than associates in our formal compliance program is only a portion of whats needed in our overall compliance efforts if we are to succeed it also is important to give our associates the training tools and support they need to serve our customers in the right way so in fy we updated and extended our compliance training programs these enhancements are discussed in greater detail below additionally recognizing the key role our company leaders play in shaping our culture and in teaching behaviors we revised our evaluation processes for a number of key leadership positions to more clearly include compliance matters walmart has a long standing program to define and promote ethical behavior walmart global ethics is responsible for promoting walmarts culture of integrity global ethics is the custodian of walmarts statement of ethics https walmartethics com and handles questions about ethical issues as well as concerns or reports of wrongdoing among other responsibilities like our compliance program our ethics function has significantly grown and developed over the last few years in fy we announced a plan to merge walmarts ethics and compliance programs walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year which will align walmart with industry norms and make our programs more effective as these teams leverage one anothers capabilities we expect to complete the transition globally in fy anti corruption is a particular area of emphasis for our compliance program during fy we continued to develop our internal anti corruption resources for example we supplemented our anti corruption leadership team by recruiting anti corruption directors in the ecommerce businesses at walmart com br brazil and yihaodian com china working with walmarts global anti corruption team these new directors conduct due diligence develop and provide anti corruption training and oversee the implementation of anti corruption policies and procedures also in fy walmart began to appoint teams of compliance monitors in each of our international retail markets these monitors known as continuous improvement teams regularly visit our stores assess the effectiveness of our compliance controls at store level train our managers and associates on proper compliance procedures and assist the operators in correcting any issues identified during fy the continuous improvement team completed over assessments at our retail locations identified any deviations from our policies and processes and collaborated with our store operators to correct over of those issues by year end in fy we expanded this concept by beginning to carry out a multi year plan to establish teams of compliance monitors focused on anti corruption policies and our related financial controls as with the existing continuous improvement teams these monitors are designed to constantly assess and improve our performance we began the process of appointing these internal anti corruption monitors in fy and the monitors conducted their first assessments in fy in light of the progress in building our internal anti corruption capabilities in fy we transitioned to our internal staff a number of activities that external consultants had been handling this increases the capabilities of our internal anti corruption team which is critical to the effectiveness and long term sustainability of our anti corruption program policies and processes last years report noted that in fy our global compliance subject matter leaders reviewed and revised the companys global policies on each of the key compliance subject matters building on that experience in fy the company undertook a project to review and as necessary revise the corresponding jurisdiction specific procedures in each of our retail markets as a result over the last two years we have taken both a global and market specific view of our procedures and have incorporated the most recent developments in applicable regulations this process of reassessing and adjusting will recur periodically to ensure the companys policies processes and other compliance efforts remain relevant to our business conditions to inform the process we conduct periodic formal compliance risk assessments the company conducted such assessments in fy and fy with each assessment we are able to refine our knowledge of the issues that may affect our business and to measure the effectiveness of our controls and other compliance measures the information obtained during the fy walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year assessments also provided critical data for senior management and our board to use in establishing the priorities and the formal compliance objectives for fy in addition to refining our written policies and procedures we continue to devote substantial attention to training our associates through various formal and informal means for example in fy the company designed an enhanced global anti corruption training and communication program to further define target audiences for anti corruption messaging and to more effectively teach anti corruption principles this program came to life over the past year in several ways including developing simplified anti corruption messaging for use in our stores in five key markets providing anti corruption training to our associates around the world in seven languages delivering communications from business leaders in each international market regarding integrity and anti corruption enhancing the ways in which we track our anti corruption training efforts and expanding our anti corruption training beyond our associates to include key third parties who do business with walmart in fy we provided anti corruption training to third party partners in international markets of course anti corruption is only one focus of our training efforts in fy we also improved our training efforts by developing onboarding compliance training materials for new associates in each of our markets and expanding our compliance training to provide additional information for our newly promoted or hired global officers upon assuming their new positions in fy we also reviewed and enhanced a number of our key compliance processes to make them more efficient and effective these enhancements related to processes for preventing money laundering complying with foreign asset control regulations and securing our licenses and permits around the globe among others fy was a notable year of progress for our global food safety program for example for the past years the non governmental global food safety initiative has provided guidance for industry driven food safety standards to achieve a safer global supply chain to assess compliance with the initiatives standards third party auditors compare companies practices to one or more of the initiatives recognized schemesindustry standards the initiative has determined meet internationally recognized food safety requirements walmart has long been a leader in this process in we became the first nationwide u s grocer to adopt the initiatives standards and in fy our international division more than doubled the percentage of company owned food production factories certified under the initiative these certifications walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year provide our customers with assurance that the food produced at these facilities meets the highest safety standards finally several of our fy objectives addressed compliance and social responsibility in our supply chain we value the women and men who make the products we sell at walmart over the past year we introduced several key improvements to our responsible sourcing program to help factories suppliers and our own associates understand their roles in creating safe positive working environments this includes obtaining increased disclosures from suppliers who make our private brand products we are using those disclosures along with other data to move to a risk based approach to auditing factories in the last year we also revised and published enhanced fire safety standards and comprehensive training materials to help factories improve compliance with our standards for suppliers finally we have developed partnerships with external groups focused on worker well being and safety such as the alliance for bangladesh worker safety the coalition of immokalee workers and stronger together by strengthening our internal programs and establishing partnerships to drive progress on key industry wide issues we are able to make an even bigger difference for workers in our supply chain systems analytics with many retail locations and associates throughout the world we have a wealth of data available to help us anticipate and identify compliance risks efficiently collecting and utilizing those data can be a challenge in fy the company launched an ambitious effort to develop and deploy a number of global systems to assist with this task in fy the company spent more than million usd carrying out this effort and made significant progress in installing and utilizing these technologies this included technology to track the work of walmarts continuous improvement teams around the globe these teams visit our locations to monitor conditions and to provide training when necessary when the teams visit a location this closed loop system helps them document observations and follow up on prior findings conduct due diligence research on third parties that may interact with governmental entities on our behalf the technology for instance collectsinformation from the third parties about their businesses and key personnel it then searches various databases to identify adverse news stories litigation government sanctions and politically exposed persons relating to the third parties and their key personnel deliver training in a more efficient and engaging way this enhanced training technology has been installed in several of our retail markets home offices and will be expanded in fy centralize the oversight of our license and permit applications and renewals in fy we extended a global license management system into of our international retail markets the expanded management system organizes the licensing and permitting requirements in each market simplifies the process for applying for licenses and provides a single repository for documentation associated with our licensing obligations walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year our associates now have critical licensing information at their fingertips along with analytics to predict and prepare for our licensing needs streamline the process of ensuring that the food we sell is top quality and safe for years we have used a sustainable paperless auditing and record keeping spark system in our u s stores spark utilizes state of the art devices to measure food temperatures and electronically track the information in fy we began a multi year plan to expand the spark system to our international retail markets looking down the road these examples are a subset of the companys progress in addressing ethics and compliance issues in fy find additional examples in walmarts global responsibility report all of these efforts are part of walmarts continuing commitment to doing business the right way to support that commitment the company and our board have elected to use again in fy the same process for setting top level compliance objectives for this third year of setting such objectives and following discussions of both our progress and our data on current risks and performance senior management proposed focusing on compliance objectives to be accomplished in fy the audit committee and cngc approved these objectives and once again linked them to a portion of our senior executives compensation we look forward to seeing these improvements and innovations help our business flourish and our customers live better walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal
