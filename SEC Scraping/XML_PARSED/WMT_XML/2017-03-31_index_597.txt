and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the u s and globally strategic risksgeneral or macro economic factors both domestically and internationally may materially adversely affect our financial performance general economic conditions and other economic factors globally or in one or more of the markets we serve may adversely affect our financial performance higher interest rates lower or higher prices of petroleum products including crude oil natural gas gasoline and diesel fuel higher costs for electricity and other energy weakness in the housing market inflation deflation increased costs of essential services such as medical care and utilities higher levels of unemployment decreases in consumer disposable income unavailability of consumer credit higher consumer debt levels changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns fluctuations in currency exchange rates higher tax rates imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws changes in healthcare laws other regulatory changes the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the u s or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the u s or such other markets change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results in addition the economic factors listed above any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation labor insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices and other economic factors in the u s and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating selling general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results the economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or in more extreme cases in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers demand for the products and services we sell our market share and the growth of our business it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns the success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings price transparency assortment of products customer experience convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products as a result of these factors we plan to increase investments in e commerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on comparable store sales and e commerce for growth any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for the products we sell our market share and the growth of our business we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators whether through physical retail digital retail or the integration of both which could materially adversely affect our financial performance the retail business is highly competitive each of our segments competes for customers employees store and club sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and global retailers and wholesale club operators as well as other national and international internet based retailers and retail intermediaries our walmart u s segment competes with retailers operating discount department retail and wholesale grocers drug dollar variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores and hypermarkets as well as e commerce and catalog businesses our sam s club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers general merchandise wholesalers and distributors gasoline stations and e commerce retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug dollar stores variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores hypermarkets wholesale clubs home improvement stores specialty electronics stores apparel stores wholesale clubs cash carry operations convenience stores and e commerce and catalog businesses we compete in a variety of ways including the prices at which we sell our merchandise merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours in store amenities the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer the attractiveness and ease of use of our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online through mobile commerce applications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale a failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance see item business above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance failure to grow our e commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise and the cost of our increasing e commerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position net sales and financial performance the retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications as a result the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate we plan to increase our investments in e commerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e commerce sales which are included in our calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for months for growth the success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this item a our investments in e commerce technology store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e commerce business increase comparable store sales maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings if we fail to successfully implement our strategy our market position net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected in addition a greater concentration of e commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs which would in turn reduce the opportunities for cross store or cross club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations in addition the cost of certain e commerce and technology investments including any operating losses incurred by acquired e commerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term operational risksnatural disasters changes in climate and geo political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms floods earthquakes tsunamis weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms droughts and tornadoes whether as a result of climate change or otherwise severe changes in climate and geo political events such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to or the complete loss of one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution facilities the lack of an adequate work force in a market the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores clubs and distribution facilities are located the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur such as superstorm sandy in the u s in or the numerous storm systems in the u s in recent years and could adversely affect our financial performance in light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons tropical storms earthquakes floods and tsunamis as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses we have chosen to be primarily self insured with respect to such losses although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses from such causes we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to or the destruction of any stores clubs and distribution facilities loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage as well as in the event of a catastrophe to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance we expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws including labor safety and environmental laws and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the u s political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet certain of our supplier standards including our responsible sourcing standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise safety and quality issues disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores clubs and other facilities including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the u s currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the u s s foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance if the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations we could lose customers incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand reputation and financial performance our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and non food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food or non food items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our brand reputation and financial performance we rely extensively on information systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary back up systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical information systems our information systems including our back up systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denial of service attacks security breaches through cyber attacks from cyber attackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates our information systems are essential to our business operations including the processing of transactions management of our associates facilities logistics inventories physical stores and clubs and our online operations if our information systems and our back up systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim any interruption in both our information systems and back up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our information systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives if the technology based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our e commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected many of our customers shop with us over our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications which are a part of our multi channel sales strategy increasingly customers are using computers tablets and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience as a part of our multi channel sales strategy in addition to home delivery we offer walmart pickup pickup today and club pickup and in a growing number of locations online grocery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local walmart store or sam s club which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs multi channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the u s and in a number of markets in which our walmart international segment operates we must anticipate and meet our customers changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment any failure on our part to provide attractive user friendly secure e commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of e commerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope and the computer systems and operating systems on which they run including those applications and systems in our acquired e commerce businesses may be subject to cyber attacks those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers or members payment information and related risks discussed below such attacks if successful can also create denials of service or otherwise disable degrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers and members shopping experience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications if we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile commerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters we could suffer loss of sales reductions in traffic reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company customers members associates and vendors whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise could damage our reputation result in litigation or other legal actions against us cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results as do most retailers we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e commerce websites and mobile commerce applications we also utilize third party service providers for a variety of reasons including without limitation for encryption and authentication technology content delivery to customers and members back office support and other functions such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers members associates or vendors in addition our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and cyber attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single hackers or small groups of hackers each year cyber attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems we have in place substantial security measures to protect and to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems and the information stored on such systems we also have security processes protocols and standards that are applicable to our third party service providers including cloud service providers to protect information from our systems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us we constantly monitor developments in cyber threats evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new and additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the information stored on our systems we require our third party service providers to do the same nevertheless as cyber threats evolve change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber attacks might defeat our or a third party service provider s security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers members associates and vendors associate error or malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third party service providers security measures and a breach of our or their information systems moreover hardware software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security we or our third party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs any breach of our security measures or any breach error or malfeasance of those of our third party service providers and loss of our confidential information or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers members associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations in addition such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers members associates vendors and shareholders as well as our operations net sales results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies moreover a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our digital retail operations we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit and debit cards our private label credit cards and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and the payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyber attacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyber attacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyber attack or incursion in our or one of our third party service provider s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations cash flows and liquidity the retail pharmacy operations in our walmart u s and sam s club segments generate substantial net sales a large majority of which are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with third party payers and payment administrators such as private insurers governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks including reductions in the third party reimbursement rates for drugs changes in our payer mix i e shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms changes in third party payer drug formularies i e the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment growth in and our participation in or exclusion from exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by pbms and or any insurance plan or program increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell increases in the administrative burden associated with seeking third party reimbursement changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition changes in drug mix i e the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics changes in the health insurance market generally changes in the scope of or the elimination of medicare part d or medicaid drug programs increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations further consolidation among third party payers pbms or purchasers of drugs overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act and other changes in laws rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business if the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies one or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations and the net sales and gross margin of those operations result in the loss of cross store or club selling opportunities and in turn adversely affect our overall net sales other results of operations cash flows and liquidity our failure to attract and retain qualified associates increases in wage and benefit costs changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected the wage increases for over associates in our operations in the u s and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the u s that we announced in february and related wage increases for million associates occurring in february have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly if we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit achieving decreases in our operating selling general and administrative expense or a combination of both our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal in addition if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs our financial performance could be materially adversely affected impediments to the expansion of our walmart international operations and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that segment could materially adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy for our walmart international segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have existing operations our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods economic business and legal environments in foreign markets may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in such markets which may adversely impact our financial results if we cannot effectively continue to expand our walmart international segment through opening new units growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected our walmart international segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations physical retail operations or both for example in fiscal we entered into a strategic alliance with jd com inc providing for walmart china to be a preferred retailer on its online to offline platform and our sam s club business in china to be a flagship store on its marketplace any strategic alliance may not generate the level of e commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance in addition any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance such as our investment in jd com inc could materially adversely affect our financial performance financial risksfluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations our operations in countries other than the u s are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u s dollars and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets liabilities net sales other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the u s from local currencies into u s dollars using exchange rates for the current period in recent years fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations as a result of such translations fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period to period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period over period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period over period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our walmart international operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold when we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit consequently fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations including our comparable store and club sales growth rates e commerce growth rates gross margin or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies legal tax regulatory compliance reputational and other risksour operations subject us to legislative judicial accounting legal regulatory tax political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance in addition to our u s operations we operate our retail business principally through wholly owned subsidiaries in argentina brazil canada chile china india japan and the united kingdom and our majority owned subsidiaries in africa central america and mexico in fiscal our walmart u s and sam s club operating segments generated approximately of our consolidated net sales the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the u s and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the u s and the imposition of a border tax or a border adjustment tax on imports into the u s a significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our u s stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise whether imported directly or indirectly and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our u s operations and our business during fiscal our walmart international operations generated approximately of our consolidated net sales our operating segments also source goods and services from other countries our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability local and global economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints local product safety and environmental laws tax regulations local labor laws anti money laundering laws and regulations trade policies currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future the potential imposition by the u s of a border tax or border adjustment tax new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such country from the u s or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of u s based companies including us with customers and others in that country this could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries our business and results of operations in the uk may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates increases in food costs changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws resulting from the uk s anticipated exit from the european union brazilian federal state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations although the company believes it complies with those laws the company s subsidiaries in brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non income tax assessments which have arisen during the normal course of business in brazil these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the company could materially adversely affect our financial performance the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies of the u s and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the u s additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the u s the various risks inherent in doing business in the u s generally also exist when doing business outside of the u s and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our associates contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by u s laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or the laws and regulations of other countries such as the uk bribery act we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u s laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation we are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the u s and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated the u s congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for federal tax reform plans under consideration may result in significant changes to the u s tax code some of the changes contemplated by the u s congress like the border tax or border adjustment tax could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes and our overall tax liability and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in worldwide tax laws regulations or accounting principles we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation in particular we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws as well as a number of cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws in addition asda stores ltd asda a wholly owned subsidiary of the company has been named as a defendant in nearly equal value claims pending in the manchester employment tribunal the employment tribunal in the united kingdom the claimants who are current and former asda store employees allege that the work performed by female employees in asda s retail stores is of equal value in terms of among other things the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in asda s warehouses and distribution facilities and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified the claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis at present we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings we discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption item legal proceedings and in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and are included as an exhibitto this annual report on form k we could be subject to liability penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on going fcpa matter the audit committee of our board of directors has been conducting an internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the fcpa and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries including wal mart de mxico s a b de c v walmex and whether prior allegations of such violations and or misconduct were appropriately handled by the company we have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our policies practices and internal controls for anti corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti corruption compliance programs since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti corruption compliance programs the audit committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the fcpa inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential fcpa violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate including but not limited to brazil china and india in november we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the u s department of justice the doj and the sec we have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters as discussions regarding resolution are preliminary we cannot currently predict the timing the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters a number of federal and local government agencies in mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters furthermore lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of walmex s current and former officers we could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters one or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on going government investigations and such actions if brought may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions cease and desist orders debarment or other relief criminal convictions and or penalties the shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings we also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences moreover we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations while we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters given the on going nature and complexity of the review inquiries and investigations we cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business given the inherent uncertainties in such situations we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future item b unresolved staff commentsnone item propertiesthe number of supercenters discount stores

greatest amount to the company s net sales and operating income walmart international consists of our operations outside of the u s and includes retail wholesale and other businesses these businesses consist of numerous formats including supercenters supermarkets hypermarkets warehouse clubs including sam s clubs cash carry home improvement specialty electronics apparel stores drug stores and convenience stores as well as digital retail the overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u s primarily because of its merchandise mix walmart international is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions as well as by adding retail wholesale and other units and expanding digital retail sam s club consists of membership only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail as a membership only warehouse club membership income is a significant component of the segment s operating income sam s club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments the following examples illustrate the pursuit of our strategy to create a customer centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping in september we completed the acquisition of jet com inc jet com a u s based e commerce company the total purchase price for the acquisition was billion net of cash acquired the preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes billionin goodwill and billionin intangible assets as part of the transaction consideration we will pay additional amounts accounted for as compensation of approximately billionover a five year period including approximately billion in cash and approximately billion in equity the impact on fiscal net sales and operating income as a result of the acquisition was not significant the acquisition of jet com is in line with the company s strategic framework of accelerating e commerce growth in june we announced our strategic alliance with jd com inc jd and the sale to jd of certain assets relating to yihaodian our e commerce operations in china including the yihaodian brand website and application in exchange for approximately percent of jd s outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis the sale resulted in the recognition of a million noncash gain in our international segment which gain is included in membership and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income subsequently during fiscal the company purchased billion of additional jd shares classified as available for sale securities representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of jd s outstanding ordinary shares each of our segments contributes to the company s operating results differently each however has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the company s net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the walmart international segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates our fiscal year ends on january for our u s and canadian operations we consolidate all other operations generally using a one month lag and on a calendar year basis our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays as well as weather patterns historically our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending january table of contentsthis discussion which presents our results for the fiscal years ended january fiscal january fiscal and january fiscal should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the company s performance additionally the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income comparable store and club sales and other measures management measures the results of the company s segments using each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations as well as other measures from time to time we revise the measurement of each segment s operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmart s definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations expansions and conversions as well as e commerce sales we measure the e commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through websites and mobile commerce applications and fulfilled through our e commerce distribution facilities as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications but fulfilled through our stores and clubs sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store s retail square feet of more than five percent additionally sales related to e commerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for months comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing our operating results we use the term currency exchange rates to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results including net sales and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future the retail industrywe operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets as well as e commerce and catalog businesses many of these competitors are national regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees whom we call associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to catastrophic events weather competitive pressures consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability cost of goods currency exchange rate fluctuations customer preferences deflation inflation fuel and energy prices general economic conditions insurance costs interest rates labor costs tax rates cybersecurity attacks and unemployment further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our company and an investment in its securities can be found under item a risk factors in our annual report on form kfor the fiscal year ended january and in the discussion under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and information in our annual report on form kfor the fiscal year ended january table of contentscompany performance metricswe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices supported by everyday low costs at times we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate for several years our performance metrics emphasized three financial priorities growth expense leverage and returns we are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integration of digital and physical retail these investments support long term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everyday low cost during this time of increased investments we are focused primarily on growth balanced by the long term health of the company including expense leverage and returns although we will continue to grow through new stores and clubs our growth going forward will rely more on increasing comparable store and club sales and accelerating e commerce sales growth our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing working capital to deliver strong free cash flow we plan to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends growthwe measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period over period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales which include the impact of e commerce sales at times we make strategic investments which are focused on the long term growth of the company these strategic investments may not benefit net sales and

calendar comparable store and club salescomparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs including e commerce sales for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally reports comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar also known as the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable store and club sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases however when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below we are referring to our calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar as our fiscal calendar differs from the

club sales in the u s including fuel increased and in fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the fiscal total u s comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e commerce sales at the walmart u s segment partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the sam s club segment e commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately and for walmart u s and sam s club respectively for fiscal the fiscal total u s comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e commerce sales at the walmart u s segment offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the sam s club segment e commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately and for walmart u s and sam s club respectively for fiscal as we continue to add new stores and clubs in the u s we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately and in fiscal and respectively our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs to those of nearby non impacted stores and clubs in each case as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened table of contentsreturnswhile we are focused primarily on growth we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced we generate returns by efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital we monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics which we discuss below in addition we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section we include return on assets roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap and return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets return on assets and return on investment management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was and for the fiscal years ended january and respectively roi was and for the fiscal years ended january and respectively the declines in roa and roi were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these periods we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of eight when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi table of contentsthe calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows fiscal years ended january amounts in millions calculation of

cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resourcesfor discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billion billionand billionfor fiscal and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion billionand billionfor fiscal and respectively the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to improved working capital management additionally we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable

consolidated financial statements which is captioned contingencies and appears elsewhere herein table of contentssummary of critical accounting estimatesmanagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the u s these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates management continually reviews our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements inventorieswe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segment s inventories the inventory at the walmart international segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the first in first out fifo method the retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory the inventory at the sam s club segment is valued using the lifo method under the retail method of accounting inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns the retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage when management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year when necessary we record a lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo we provide for estimated inventory losses or shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales following annual inventory counts the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance such as operating income and cash flows the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level or in certain markets at the market group level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived assets is impaired resulting in a write down of the related long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative market based approach historically our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted table of contentsincome taxesincome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions accordingly the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies increases and decreases in valuation allowances changes in tax law outcomes of administrative audits the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the u s statutory rate and may fluctuate as a result our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectations of future taxable income carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies this evaluation relies heavily on estimates table of contentscautionary statement regarding forward looking statementsthis annual report to shareholders contains

will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the u s and anticipates the company s domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly the company intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the

line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result the payments regardless of the significance are automatic indicators of ownership and require the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing

recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not material goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following

to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the levels of the fair value hierarchy are level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable andlevel unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop its own assumptions recurring fair value measurementsthe company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis the fair values are the

contentsnote derivative financial instrumentsthe company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies subsequent to entering into derivative transactions the company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties in connection with various derivative agreements including master netting arrangements the company held cash collateral from counterparties of millionand millionat january and january respectively the company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties the company is also required to post

january and had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at january the company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and accordingly the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings the company s net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been and is not expected to be significant instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has

fixed rate pay variable rate interest rate swaps that the company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the company s exposure due to credit loss the company s interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay variable interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed rate debt being hedged the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items also recorded in earnings and accordingly do not impact the company s consolidated statements of income these fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from october to april net investment instrumentsthe company is a party to cross currency interest rate swaps that the company uses to hedge its net investments the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed rate payments in one currency for fixed rate payments in

subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings the hedged items are recognized foreign currency denominated liabilities that are re measured at spot exchange rates each period and the assessment of effectiveness and measurement of any ineffectiveness is based on total changes in the related derivative s cash flows as a result the

consolidated financial statements include the accounts of walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended january fiscal january fiscal and january fiscal all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation we consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of those entities operations investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements are accounted for primarily using the equity method these investments are immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements the company s consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending on january for the united states u s and canadian operations the company consolidates all other operations generally using a one month lag and based on a calendar year there were no significant intervening events during january that materially affected the consolidated financial statements use of estimatesthe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities management s estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalentsthe company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents all credit card debit card and electronic benefits transfer transactions that

operations the company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the u s and anticipates the company s domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly the company intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the company s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within the company s foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits although there can be no assurance of the impact on the company of potential federal tax reform in the u s the company does not expect current local laws other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the u s to have a material effect on the company s overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations as of january and cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the u s due to local laws or other restrictions

billion respectively interest costs capitalized on construction projects were million million and million in fiscal and respectively leasesthe company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company the expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the company s capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result the payments regardless of the significance are automatic indicators of ownership and require the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term at the end of the lease term

recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not material goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net

basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following

eliminated in consolidation we consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of those entities operations investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements are accounted for primarily using the equity method these investments are immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements the company s consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending on january for the united states u s and canadian operations the company consolidates all other operations generally using a one month lag and based on a calendar year there were no significant intervening events during january that materially affected the consolidated financial statements use of estimates policy use of estimatesthe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities management s estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets

liquidity needs in the company s non u s operations the company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the u s and anticipates the company s domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings accordingly the company intends with only certain exceptions to continue to indefinitely reinvest the company s earnings held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate the company realizes an effective tax rate benefit if the company s intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change most of the amounts held within the company s foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriation under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits although there can be no assurance of the impact on the company of potential federal tax reform in the u s the company does not expect current local laws other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the u s to have a material effect on the company s overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations as of january and cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion and billion respectively may not be freely transferable to the u s due to

equipment property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal and was billion billion and billion respectively interest costs capitalized on construction projects were million million and million in fiscal and respectively lease policy leasesthe company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the company the expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight line rent expense additionally the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset whichever is shorter if significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset whichever is shorter rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the company s capital lease tests and in determining straight line rent expense for operating leases the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result the payments regardless of the significance are automatic indicators of ownership and require the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term at the end of the lease term including exercise of any renewal options the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non cash gain on sale of the property impairment or disposal of long lived assets policy long lived assetslong lived assets are stated at cost management reviews long lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is at the individual store or club level or in certain circumstances a market group of stores undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets useful lives based on updated projections if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique impairment charges of long lived assets for fiscal and were not material goodwill and intangible assets policy goodwill and other acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized rather they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired definite lived intangible assets are considered long lived assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the company s reporting units generally a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary if management determines after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required the quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market based approaches the company s reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and accordingly the company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill the following table reflects goodwill activity by reportable segment for fiscal and amounts in millions walmartu s walmartinternationalsam sclubtotalbalances as

redemption becomes remote or waiting for the gift card to expire additionally management continues to assess the guidance and the related interpretation to determine if that guidance will impact the
