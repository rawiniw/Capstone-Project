press release the press release will disclose information regarding the companys results of operations for the three months ended april and the companys financial condition as of april the press release provides information regarding certain financial measures that may be considered non gaap financial measures each a non gaap measure under the rules of the sec those non gaap measures are the companys free cash flow calculated as set forth in the press release for the three month periods ended april and free cash flow the companys return on investment roi calculated as set forth in the press release for the trailing twelve month periods ended april and financial measures stated to be presented on a constant currency basis each an adjusted constant currency measure the adjusted constant currency measures are calculated by translating the results of the companys walmart international operating segment walmart international for a current fiscal period in the local currencies in which walmart international operates into u s dollars using the currency exchange rates used to translate the similar results of walmart international for the prior year comparable period into u s dollars to report those prior year comparable period results in the companys consolidated financial statements for that prior year comparable period and excluding the effect of acquisitions on such current fiscal period results until the effect of such acquisitions are included in both the current fiscal period results and the prior year comparable period results the adjusted constant currency measures included in the press release exclude the effect of the results attributable to the netto stores in the united kingdom and of the companys majority owned subsidiary massmart holdings limited the acquisitions of which the company completed during the three months ended july the acquisitions the companys total u s comparable store sales for the thirteen week periods ended april and april the total u s comparable store sales the comparable club sales of the companys sams club operating segment sams club for the thirteen week periods ended april april and july and the projected comparable club sales of sams club for the thirteen week period ending july in each case calculated by excluding the fuel sales of sams club for such periods the net sales of sams club for the three

of sams club for that three month period over the net sales of sams club for the three months ended april excluding the fuel sales of sams club for that three month period the increase in the companys

and the sams club comparable club sales for the thirteen week periods ended april and april to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap exhibit to this current report on form k the information in which is incorporated into this item by reference sets forth reconciliations of each other non gaap measure that appears in the press release and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to the extent such reconciliations are reasonably practicable the companys management believes that the presentation of the non gaap measures discussed above other than free cash flow and roi which are discussed in the press release provides useful information to investors regarding the companys financial condition and results of operations as to the periods for which they are presented for the following reasons the company is required to translate walmart internationals operating results as stated in local currencies into u s dollars to report the companys consolidated results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states period over period comparisons of the companys consolidated results of operations can be affected by the differences between currency exchange rates in the prior fiscal period to which the comparison is made and the currency exchange rates in the current fiscal period as reflected in the companys consolidated results of operations reported in u s dollars making an investors assessment of the underlying performance of walmart international and its effect on total company underlying performance for the current fiscal period more difficult moreover the inclusion of the results of acquisitions in the companys consolidated results of operations and the results of operations of walmart international for current periods when such acquisitions had not been consummated during the prior year comparable periods makes it more difficult for investors to assess the comparative period over period underlying performance of walmart international and total company underlying performance without the effect on such underlying performance of such acquisitions on the current periods results the presentation of the adjusted constant currency measures permits investors to understand the combined effects of currency exchange rate translations and acquisitions on the companys consolidated net sales and consolidated operating income and walmart internationals net sales and operating income and on the period over period increases in the companys consolidated net sales and consolidated operating income and walmart internationals net sales in each case for the periods as to which the adjusted financial measures are presented and what the companys financial performance as reflected by those measures would have been for the periods for which the adjusted financial measures are presented without the combined effects of currency exchange rate translations and such acquisitions the presentation of the companys total u s comparable store sales sams clubs comparable club sales the net sales of sams club and the period over period percentage increase in the net sales of sams club calculated in each case excluding the fuel sales of sams club permits investors to understand the effect of such fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on the companys total u s comparable store sales on sams clubs comparable club sales and on sams clubs net sales for the periods presented the presentation of the period over period increase in the companys consolidated membership and other income calculated excluding the gain from the sale of an investment recorded in the three months ended april permits investors to assess the companys period over period underlying performance with respect to the consolidated membership and other income of the company without the effect of a gain of a type that is not frequently included in the companys consolidated membership and other income the presentation of the increase in the companys consolidated operating income for the three months ended april over the companys consolidated operating income for the three months ended april excluding the effect of million of net pre tax items realized in the three months ended april permits investors to assess the companys period over period underlying performance with respect to the companys consolidated operating income without the effect of those items which were an aggregation of items of types that do not occur frequently in the companys operations item other information the audit committee of the

gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most nearly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billion and negative million for the quarters ended april and respectively free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities forthethreemonthsended april amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities calculation of return on investment and return on assets management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percent and percent for the trailing months ended april and respectively we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assets trailingtwelvemonthsended april dollar amounts in millions

income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of april certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of continuing operations as of april and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the companys
