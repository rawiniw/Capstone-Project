also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated adjusted eps guidance for fiscal by adjusting for the amount of the impact of the q loss on the early extinguishment of certain debt and the gain on the sale of suburbia in mexico fiscal diluted net income per share forecasted eps adjustments pre tax
