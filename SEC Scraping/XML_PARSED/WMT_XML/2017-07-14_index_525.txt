knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the levels of the fair value hierarchy are level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable andlevel unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the plan to develop its own assumptions
