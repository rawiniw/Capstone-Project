affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements notes and supplemental schedule actual results could differ from these estimates new accounting pronouncementsin july the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu plan accounting defined benefit pension plans topic defined contribution pension plans topic and health and welfare benefit plans topic part i fully benefit responsive investment contracts part ii plan investment disclosures and part iii measurement date practical expedient part i requires fully benefit responsive investment contracts to be measured presented and disclosed only at contract value part ii requires that investments that are measured using fair value both participant directed and nonparticipant directed investments be grouped only by general type eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments by nature characteristics and risks part ii also eliminates the disclosure of individual investments that represent percent or more of net assets available for benefits and the disclosure of net appreciation or depreciation for investments by general type requiring only presentation of net appreciation or depreciation in investments in the aggregate additionally if an investment is measured using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient and that investment is a fund that files a u s department of labor form as a direct filing entity disclosure of that investment s strategy is no longer required part iii is not applicable to the plan the plan has elected to early adopt asu accordingly the plan retrospectively modified its investment disclosures as described above the adoption had no effect on the plan s statement of net assets available for benefits for the years ended january and or statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended january in may fasb issued asu disclosure for investments in certain entities that calculate net assets value per share or its equivalent the standard eliminates the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient in addition the update limits disclosures to investments for which the entity elected to measure the fair value using the practical expedient rather than all eligible investments the standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december the plan has elected to early adopt this asu retrospectively as of january the adoption had no effect on the plan s change in net assets available for benefits or net assets available for benefits previously reported table of contents investmentsthe trustee holds the plan s investments and executes all investment transactions the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market volatility and credit risks the plan attempts to limit these risks by authorizing and offering participants a broad range of investment options that are invested in high quality securities or are offered and administered by reputable and known investment and insurance companies due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits the plan s exposure to a concentration of risk is limited by the diversification of investments acrossmultipleinvestment fund options additionally the investments within each investment fund option are further diversified into varied financial instruments at january and participants may allocate their investments among and investment funds respectively consisting of a variety of underlying equity securities mutual funds bonds and common collective trusts and may change their investment elections daily for future contributions table of contents fair value measurementsthe plan records and discloses certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities at their fair value the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the levels of the fair value hierarchy are level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable andlevel unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the plan to develop its own
