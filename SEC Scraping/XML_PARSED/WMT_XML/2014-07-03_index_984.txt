conservatively applied the full impact of the pre fiscal year errors to the fiscal year ended january in addition to the quantitative assessment of materiality we also made a qualitative assessment of the materiality of the corrections our qualitative assessment included the considerations outlined in staff accounting bulletin no based on our quantitative and qualitative assessments we concluded that the financial statement impact related to the error corrections both individually and in the aggregate was not material to any period presented in our fiscal consolidated financial statements annually or quarterly as a result based on the guidance of asc no restatement or revision of prior period financial statements was required we identified potential lease accounting inconsistencies with our global accounting policies as part of an internal control optimization review in our mexico subsidiary that we performed during the second quarter of fiscal conducted as part of our planning and scoping process for our annual evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting subsequently while we began an effort to determine if the lease accounting practices in mexico were incorrect and if necessary determine the adjustment to be recorded we also began a process to inquire of our other subsidiaries as to whether similar lease accounting inconsistencies existed in october we identified additional potential inconsistencies with the accounting practices for certain leases in our china subsidiary in the fourth quarter of fiscal we completed our review of leases in mexico and china and the related lease accounting upon letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page concluding that the accounting for some leases in these subsidiaries was incorrect we quantified and recorded the correction of these immaterial accounting errors upon concluding in the fourth quarter that errors in lease accounting existed we evaluated the related internal controls and determined that certain controls were deficient primarily related to the proper determination of the lease term as part of our evaluation of the severity of these deficiencies we considered the magnitude of the misstatement and whether there was a reasonable possibility our controls would fail to prevent or detect and correct a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure additional considerations in assessing the severity of these deficiencies included the following the deficiencies were not indications of fraud on the part of senior management the deficiencies did not result in a restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a material misstatement due to error or fraud the deficiencies were not identified by the auditor under circumstances that indicate the misstatement would not otherwise have been detected by the entity s internal control and the deficiencies were not the result of ineffective oversight of the company s financial reporting and internal control by those charged with governance based on these considerations we determined that the internal control deficiencies did not result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis as such we concluded the internal control deficiencies individually or in the aggregate did not represent a material weakness requiring disclosure in our form k in december we enhanced our controls in mexico and china to clarify the determination of a lease term including that only one lease term can be determined for a single lease and that lease term must be applied consistently to all related accounting for that lease as of january we concluded that these revised controls were designed effectively however as the revised controls had not been operating for a sufficient amount of time we concluded that a deficiency still existed as of the evaluation date in accordance with items and of regulation s k we disclosed the conclusions of our principal executive and principal financial officers regarding the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures additionally our form k included our annual report on internal control over financial reporting we did not believe that the enhancement of internal controls materially affected or was reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that disclosure of this enhancement was not necessary therefore in our report we disclosed we had concluded that as of january our internal controls over financial reporting were effective notes to consolidated financial statements page note accumulated other
