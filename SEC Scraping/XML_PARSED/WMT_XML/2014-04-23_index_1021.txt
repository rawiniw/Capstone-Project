relationship based on the materiality guidelines discussed above the facts and circumstances of the relationship the amounts involved in the relationship the directors interest in such relationship if any and such other factors as the board in its judgment deemed appropriate in each case the board found the relationship with our independent directors to be immaterial to the directors independence the types of relationships considered by the board are noted below the walmart director was an officer of a walmart vendor ms mayer immediate family members of the walmart director were employees or officers of walmart vendors or service providers ms alvarez ms craig mr corbett mr reinemund and ms wolf the walmart director was also a director or trustee of a walmart vendor or service provider dr

payments from walmart during the entitys last fiscal year that account for more than of the entitys consolidated gross revenues for that entitys last fiscal year the board determined these relationships were immaterial to each directors independence because in each case the immediate family member i is not an executive officer of the entity ii is not involved in the negotiation of

the performance of our sams club segment and how sams club performance fits into our incentive plans fiscal financial performance during fiscal we operated in a challenging global environment for

back to contents results of advisory vote to approve executive compensation at each of our last three annual shareholders meetings our shareholders had an opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve our neos compensation at each of these meetings more than percent of the votes cast on this matter were voted to approve our neos compensation the cngc considered that level of support when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal as a result the cngc made no material changes in the structure of our executive compensation program for fiscal or the performance measures used in our executive compensation program for fiscal at the annual shareholders meeting we will again hold an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the cngc will consider the results from this years and future years advisory votes on executive compensation when making decisions about our executive compensation program our pay practices what we do what we do not do pay for performance we strongly link our executive compensation program to the companys operating performance and our strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns we ensure that a significant majority of our executives target compensation is performance based with the amount of the payout to our executives contingent on the degree to which the company achieves pre established performance goals that the cngc determines are aligned with the companys short and long term operating and financial objectives no employment contracts with the exception of mr duke whose retirement agreement provides that he will continue to be employed through fiscal all of our neos are employed on an at will basis however each neo has entered into an agreement pursuant to which each neo has agreed that in exchange for limited severance benefits for two years following termination of employment he or she will not participate in any business that competes with us and that has revenues exceeding certain thresholds and will not solicit our associates for employment mitigation of risk we use a combination of performance measures intended to motivate our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders by using a variety of performance measures in our annual cash incentive program and our long term performance share program we mitigate the risk that our executives will be motivated to pursue results with respect to one performance measure to the detriment of our company as a whole no unapproved trading plans board members

are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan stock ownership guidelines to further align the long term interests of our executives and our shareholders our board has

other senior officers no unapproved pledging of walmart stock board members and our executive officers are prohibited from pledging walmart stock without the pre approval of our corporate secretary further any walmart shares pledged will not be counted in determining a board members or executive officers compliance with our stock ownership guidelines independent compensation consultant the cngc benefits from its use of an independent compensation consulting firm which provides no other services to the company no dividends on unvested performance shares we do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned and unvested performance shares thorough compensation benchmarking the cngc reviews publicly available information for three different peer groups to evaluate how our neos compensation compares to that of executives in comparable positions at other companies and considers that information when establishing tdc no pension plans or special retirement programs for executive officers we do not have a pension plan and our executive officers do not participate in any retirement programs not generally available to our officers no golden parachutes or other change in control agreements other than post termination and non competition agreements providing for severance payments equal to two years of base salary in the event that walmart terminates their employment other than for a violation of walmart policy we do not have any agreements under which our executive officers would receive payments or accelerated stock vestings in the event of a change in control of our company components of neo compensation and pay mix what are the primary components of our neo compensation packages our neos each receive a base salary annual cash incentive opportunity long term performance shares and service based restricted stock these elements comprise each neos total direct compensation or tdc base salary we pay base salaries commensurate with an neos position and experience in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates a relatively small percentage of tdc to base salary annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment each neos annual target cash incentive award is based on a percentage of base salary the cash incentive payout can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our ceos target opportunity is percent of his base salary and his actual payout can range from percent of his base salary at threshold up to a proxy statement back to contents maximum of percent of his base salary no payout will be made unless the threshold performance goal is met for a particular performance measure the cngc sets the performance goals under our management incentive plan during the first quarter of each fiscal year long term equity the balance of tdc and generally the largest portion of tdc is allocated between two forms of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity awards help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders and also serve as a retention tool for our companys executives consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance percent of our annual long term equity awards is in the form of performance shares with the remaining percent granted in the form of restricted stock performance shares a performance share award gives the recipient the right to receive a number of shares if we meet certain pre defined performance goals during a specified performance period generally performance shares granted to our executives have a three year performance period with the performance measures and goals set annually by the cngc the number of shares that an neo receives at the end of the performance period is based on the average performance as compared to these performance goals during each of these three years our neos can earn from percent at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target number of shares linked to each performance metric at the time of payout for purposes of establishing the number of performance shares granted to our neos performance shares are valued by multiplying the number of shares by the share price on the date of grant which differs from the grant date fair value reported on the summary compensation table on page due to the fact that performance shares do not receive dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting restricted stock the remaining percent of the long term equity value is in the form of restricted stock which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the neo remains employed by our company through the vesting date what was the tdc for our neos during fiscal as shown in the table below fiscal target tdc represents the amounts our neos would have received if target performance goals were achieved maximum tdc represents the amounts our neos would have received if maximum performance goals were achieved and therefore is intended to reflect the amounts our neos would receive only in the event of superior performance all dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand annual cash incentive performance shares tdc base target max restricted target max target max named executive officer salary of salary of salary stock michael t duke c douglas mcmillon charles m holley jr william s simon neil m ashe rosalind g brewer for a variety of reasons the amounts in the summary compensation table may differ significantly from the tdc amounts shown above for example we generally grant equity awards to section officers including our neos for the upcoming fiscal year in january of each year before the end of the prior fiscal year the value of the awards made in january is reflected in the fiscal summary compensation table on page below we consider these grants as part of our neos fiscal tdc and therefore they are not reflected in the fiscal tdc shown above which instead include annual grants to our neos made in january proxy statement back to contents how much of our neos target tdc was performance based in fiscal as shown in the chart below a substantial majority of our neos fiscal target tdc was performance based base salary represented less than percent of our ceos target tdc for fiscal while more than percent of his target tdc was tied to performance goals for each of our other neos the percentage of target tdc that was performance based ranged from approximately percent to approximately percent the percentages may not total percent due to rounding were there any significant changes to our neos compensation for fiscal there were no significant changes to the basic tdc structure for neos in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal our neos received base salary increases ranging from approximately percent to approximately percent based on benchmarking described below and annual performance evaluations the annual cash incentive opportunity for each of our neos expressed as a percentage of base salary was unchanged for fiscal as part of their fiscal compensation packages approved in january four of our neos received increases in the target value of their annual equity awards comprised of performance shares and restricted stock as follows mr duke increase in target equity value from million to million mr simon increase in target equity value from million to million mr holley increase in target equity value from million to million and ms brewer increase in target equity value from million to million these increases were intended to reflect these neos continued experience in their leadership roles and to align their tdc more closely with comparable positions at companies within our external peer groups mr ashe was an neo during fiscal after not being an neo for fiscal a portion of mr ashes annual cash incentive is based on the gross merchandise value of our global ecommerce operations reflective of our growth priorities in the area of ecommerce in addition to the financial performance measures described above for the first time in fiscal our executive compensation program also included a compliance component as disclosed in our proxy statement our neos fiscal cash incentive payments were subject to achieving adequate progress in implementing key enhancements to the companys compliance policies processes and controls see pages for more information regarding our neos fiscal compliance objectives proxy statement back to contents are there any significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal our executive incentive compensation programs continue to be based on the financial performance measures of sales operating income and roi which are aligned with our strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns mr ashes annual cash incentive will be based in part on the gross merchandise value of the global ecommerce operations of our operating segments on a combined basis which is aligned with our strategic priority of growth for fiscal the cngc added a sales related performance measure to a portion of the cash incentive plan for our neos and as a result a portion ranging from percent to percent of the fiscal cash incentive opportunities for our current neos will be based on the sales performance of our total company or one of its operating segments or areas of responsibility the cngc approved this change to emphasize the importance of sales growth as a priority for our company and to align our neos with the officers and associates within their organizations many of whom already have a sales related performance measure as part of their cash incentive opportunity see footnote to the fiscal grants of plan based awards table on pages for more information regarding our neos performance metrics under our cash incentive plan for fiscal in addition to these financial performance measures for fiscal our executive compensation program will continue to include a compliance component as in fiscal our companys senior leadership prepared a timetable for further enhancements to our global compliance policies processes and controls to be achieved during fiscal the fiscal compliance objectives these enhancements will include improvements to the companys compliance related systems the hiring or designation of additional compliance specialists in various business units the installation and testing of anti corruption controls and the implementation of a substantial compliance related training program senior management will continue to provide quarterly reports to the audit committee on the progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives if in the judgment of the audit committee the company has not achieved adequate progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives then the cngc may reduce or eliminate fiscal annual cash incentive compensation for the relevant executive officers including our neos effective february mr mcmillon succeeded mr duke as the ceo of our company because the cngc granted equity awards that are part of fiscal compensation in january the summary compensation table on page reflects mr mcmillons equity awards granted in connection with his new position pursuant to the terms of his retirement agreement mr duke did not receive any equity awards for fiscal as reflected on the summary compensation table proxy statement back to contents fiscal performance measures and performance goals what performance measures were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal each of our neos performance measures was based on the performance of our total company or a combination of the performance of our total company and the neos respective operating segment or area of responsibility this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating officers based on performance within their control or influence while continuing to align a significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company thereby continuing to drive the companys overall business strategies and performance the performance measures

how we define return on investment or roi for purposes of the performance share award measures which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in the secs rules the cngc chose these performance measures to align our executive compensation program with the companys strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns the cngc concluded that the combination of these performance measures was likely to motivate our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders in addition the cngc believes that the combination and weighting of these performance measures helps to mitigate the risk that our executives would be motivated to pursue results with respect to one measure to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our operating income resulting increases in performance share payouts should generally be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts proxy statement back to contents what was the weighting among each of these performance measures for fiscal the following charts show the portion of each of

incentive payment is also subject to satisfying diversity objectives and each neos cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not satisfy these objectives the cngc established these diversity goals because it believes that diversity and inclusion contributes to an engaged and effective workforce for fiscal these objectives consisted of one or both of two components good faith efforts and placement objectives each of our neos is subject to good faith efforts requirements in order to satisfy the good faith efforts component of this program each neo must actively sponsor at least two associates and must also participate in at least two diversity related events each of our neos with responsibility for our walmart u s and or sams club field operations is also subject to placement objectives for fiscal mr duke mr simon and ms brewer were subject to placement objectives the determination as to whether an neo satisfied his or her placement objectives during the prior fiscal year is based on several factors including the relative number of diverse candidates placed in specified positions within the neos organization the neos engagement and participation in a diversity and inclusion strategy the neos leadership efforts in implementing these strategies and the neos efforts in recruiting and developing diverse associates applying these factors at the end of each fiscal year our chief diversity officer reviews each neos performance under our diversity program and reports the results of this review to the cngc prior to the approval of annual cash incentive payouts to our neos based on the report of our chief diversity officer the cngc determined that each neo satisfied his or her diversity goals for fiscal compliance program enhancements beginning in fiscal our executive officers cash incentive payments were also subject to achieving adequate progress in implementing enhancements to the companys global compliance program our company is committed to having and maintaining a strong and effective global compliance program in every country in which we operate in furtherance of that commitment over the past few years our company has made significant improvements to our compliance programs around the world to further emphasize our commitment to compliance in early fiscal our companys senior leadership developed a timetable for implementing further enhancements to our global compliance program on a prioritized basis the fiscal compliance objectives the fiscal compliance objectives covered such subject matters as anti corruption anti money laundering health and wellness compliance environmental compliance health and safety compliance labor and employment compliance and licensing and permits the fiscal compliance objectives sought to enhance key elements of a corporate compliance program including but not limited to developing and implementing enhanced compliance protocols and procedures hiring and training of key compliance personnel monitoring and assessment of various elements of the program internal communications and access to information as disclosed in our proxy statement if in the judgment of the audit committee the company had not achieved adequate progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives then the cngc could have exercised negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the fiscal cash incentive payments proxy statement back to contents to our executive officers during fiscal management reported regularly to the audit committee regarding ongoing enhancements to our global compliance program and progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives at the end of fiscal the audit committee determined that in its qualitative judgment adequate progress had been achieved in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives and reported its determination to the cngc factors relied on by the audit committee in making this determination included the progress achieved on workstreams in a variety of compliance areas and the extent to which that progress reflected sustainable long term change in the companys people processes systems and culture based on the qualitative assessment of the audit committee the cngc determined not to exercise negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the cash incentive payments to any of our executive

the goals established by the cngc to determine the ultimate performance share payout for the performance shares with a three year performance cycle ended january shown on page above adjustments in determining actual performance for purposes of our performance based plans i e annual cash incentive and performance shares the cngc made certain positive and negative adjustments to our reported results of operations as provided for by the terms of the applicable plans adjustments are permitted by the terms of the plans and contemplated at the time goals are established and are intended to enable results to be computed on a comparable basis from performance period to performance period for fiscal the most significant adjustments to operating income under our cash incentive plan were to adjust for the impact of costs associated with the companys termination of its joint venture with bharti enterprises in india costs associated with store closures in brazil and china charges related to a change in historical lease accounting practices in china an increase in estimated contingent liabilities related to non income taxes in brazil charges for increased contingent liabilities and to account for settlements related to employment claims in brazil and a charge relating to the restructuring of the in club leadership and staff structure of our sams club segment the most significant adjustments to sales under our performance share program for fiscal were to adjust for the impact of the pending sale of our vips restaurant operations in mexico the results of which are now included in our financial statements as discontinued operations legislative changes resulting in reductions in snap benefits the sale of walmarts interest in contacts and the impact of decisions not to open previously planned stores and unexpected delays in store openings in certain international markets for fiscal these adjustments had the effect of increasing the payments under our performance based plans payable to our neos and the percentage changes in fiscal operating income over that of fiscal shown in the tables above are higher than the changes in operating income reflected in our publicly reported operating results for fiscal as calculated in accordance with gaap proxy statement back to contents other compensation what other types of compensation did our neos receive during fiscal our neos may from time to time receive special awards special awards are typically granted for retention purposes or in recognition of extraordinary performance because these awards are not part of an neos annual compensation the special awards are not included in the tdc amounts shownabove in january the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for mr simon in the amount of million half of this award was contingent on meeting performance goals for fiscal in order for mr simon to earn the portion of the award contingent on fiscal performance total sales of our walmart u s operating segment had to increase by at least percent subject to adjustments to enable results for fiscal to be computed on a comparable basis to results for fiscal the purpose of this award was for retention purposes and to continue to emphasize the importance of walmart u s sales growth to our companys overall strategy as disclosed above on an adjusted basis walmart u s sales performance during fiscal exceeded this goal and therefore mr simon earned million of this award for fiscal performance this million is included in mr simons fiscal compensation shown on the summary compensation table on page in january the cngc approved special restricted stock awards of to mr simon of to mr ashe and of to each of ms brewer and mr holley these awards were intended primarily for retention purposes the awards to mr simon and mr holley vest on january the award to mr ashe vests in equal parts approximately one and three years from the grant date and the award to ms brewer vests approximately one year from the grant date additionally as is customary with executive officer promotions in january in connection with his promotion to president and ceo mr mcmillon received two additional performance share grants vesting at the conclusion of the performance cycles ending january and january these additional performance share awards were intended to increase mr mcmillons target performance share opportunity for each of those cycles to which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share award granted in january for the performance cycle ending january finally in connection with increases in their annual award values in january ms brewer and mr ashe also received two additional performance share grants vesting at the conclusion of the performance cycles ending january and january these additional performance share awards were intended to increase ms brewers and mr ashes target performance share opportunity for each of those cycles to and respectively which is equal to the respective target values of their annual performance share awards granted in january for the performance cycle ending january also in january the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for mr simon in the amount of the vesting of this award is contingent on walmart u s neighborhood markets achieving certain sales objectives during fiscal the purpose of this award is for retention purposes and to emphasize our smaller format growth strategy in the u s what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations for our neos and provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a limited number of hours each year our neos also receive company paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance additionally our neos are entitled to benefits available to officers generally such as participation in the deferred compensation matching plan and benefits available to associates generally including a walmart discount card a limited percent match of purchases of shares through our stock purchase plan participation in our k plan medical benefits and foreign business travel insurance we provide these perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives and we believe their limited cost is outweighed by these benefits to our company proxy statement back to contents executive compensation process and governance who establishes the tdc at walmart the cngc is the board committee that is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the officers subject to section including the ceo and other neos all members of the cngc are independent see page for more information on the cngc the cngc met seven times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including matters such as the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance measures and performance goals applicable to the neos performance based compensation and the review of performance against those goals including compliance and diversity goals how does the cngc establish tdc the process of setting tdc is a dynamic one the cngc considers among other things the overall financial and operating performance of our company and its operating segments and or areas of responsibility as applicable each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future peer group data and analyses see pages for more details and the results of recent shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation as a general guideline our neos target tdc which would be earned if target performance goals are achieved should place the neos near the th percentile of comparable positions within our peer groups the cngc believes that it is generally appropriate to position our neos target tdc at this level because as the worlds largest retailer the companys size extensive international presence and complex operations result in our neos jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at many of our peer group companies the target tdc opportunity for a particular neo may be higher or lower than the th percentile of the peer groups and may differ from the tdcs of our other neos depending on a number of factors particularly time and experience in the neos current role or in a similar role expertise individual performance historical compensation levels peer benchmarking retention and succession considerations and individual performance in evaluating individual performance the cngc relied on annual performance evaluations for each neo and discussions with the neos supervisor the tdc levels set forth in the chart above on page represent the cngcs judgment as to the appropriate fiscal compensation opportunities for our neos in light of these factors how does the cngc set performance goals the goals for our performance based compensation plans are established in light of the operating plans for our company and each of its operating segments as well as operating plans for other areas of responsibility the companys operating plans for reaching our strategic goals are reviewed by the board in light of economic conditions in our industry and in the broader markets in which we operate the companys operating plans are generally intended to be challenging and fiscal was no exception and were made more so in fiscal by the impact of the overall economic environment on our customers as well as other factors that negatively impacted our financial results during fiscal such as increased payroll taxes and frequent and severe winter storms once operating plans are established by the board the cngc then sets performance goals that are intended to be aligned with our operating plans in order to achieve the target goals in our performance based plans our company and company segments and other areas of responsibility must perform in line with our sales operating income and return on investment expectations and operating plans at the time the goals were set in order to achieve the maximum goals the performance of our company and company segments and other areas of responsibility would have to exceed those expectations to a significant degree generally goals for our international operating segment require greater increases in operating income and sales relative to our other segments this reflects our strategic growth plans proxy statement back to contents for our international operations in light of market conditions and the level of capital investment required for growth in the international markets in which we operate the cngc generally attempts to set the threshold and maximum performance goals so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the cngc generally establishes the maximum performance goals at a level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance goals at a level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify a payout the cngcs independent compensation consultant evaluates the difficulty of the performance goals and advises the cngc in this regard what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations of these neos provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our global people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews his annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc when establishing and approving the compensation of our ceo our chairman with support from our global people division and the chair of the cngc reviews our ceos performance evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation since early the cngc has engaged an independent consultant on executive compensation matters since early pay governance llc pay governance has been engaged by the cngc as its independent executive compensation consultant under the terms of its engagement pay governance reports directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc has sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting services to walmart without the approval of the cngc other than its engagement by the cngc pay governance does not perform and has never performed any other services for walmart the cngcs independent consultant attends and participates in cngc meetings at which executive compensation matters are considered and performs analyses for the cngc at the cngcs request including benchmarking realizable pay analyses analyses of the correlation between performance measures and shareholder return and assessments of the difficulty of attaining these performance goals the cngc has reviewed the independence of pay governance in light of new sec rules and nyse listed company rules regarding compensation consultant independence and has affirmatively concluded that pay governance is independent from walmart and has no conflicts of interest relating to its engagement by the cngc how is peer group data used by the cngc our company is the worlds largest retailer by a substantial margin is one of the worlds largest employers and has significantly more extensive international operations than most publicly traded u s based retailers as a result the cngc believes that simply benchmarking neo compensation against a retail industry index would not provide the cngc with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our neos therefore the cngc reviews publicly available information for three peer groups to determine how our neos compensation compares to the compensation paid to executives in comparable positions at other companies because information regarding positions comparable to those of some of our neos is not available for many of the companies in our peer groups using three peer groups results in a larger number of comparable positions against which our neos compensation can be benchmarked the cngc uses benchmarking data when allocating each neos tdc among the various elements of compensation as a general guide to ensure that the amount of tdc allocated to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation the cngc did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them while the benchmarking data is generally used for comparable positions the cngc also reviews peer group data for retail ceo positions for our executives who lead our operating segments and global ecommerce these executives have significant responsibilities and lead organizations that are considered separately from the rest of our company larger than many of the other retailers in the retail peer group and we believe that these positions are often comparable to ceo positions at many of our peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint we believe that it is more likely that these leaders would be recruited for a ceo position in the retail industry or elsewhere rather than for a lateral move therefore the cngc also benchmarks these executives compensation against the compensation of ceos within our retail peer group proxy statement back to contents retail industry survey this survey allows the cngc to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary competitors

select fortune the cngc also benchmarks our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by our global people division with input from the cngcs independent consultant the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we excluded retailers from this group because those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also excluded companies

other information in the process of setting tdc although the cngc generally considers these factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized and realizable compensation the cngc reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years the cngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys global people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation realizable by each neo for the upcoming fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation as noted above on page our shareholders have expressed strong support for our executive compensation program at our last three annual shareholders meetings the cngc considered that support when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal the cngc will continue to consider the outcome of these annual shareholder advisory votes when making future compensation decisions for our neos proxy statement back to contents what are our practices for equity awards including stock options timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our executive officers including our neos that are part of the compensation packages for those executive officers for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance shares and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent option exercise prices we have not granted stock options to our executive officers for several years and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances if and when we grant stock options the exercise price is and will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible by our company unless it is performance based a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos is intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under section m moreover the terms of equity awards granted to our neos generally provide that upon vesting the receipt of such equity will be deferred if the payment of such equity would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes when designing neo compensation the cngc considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes however to maintain flexibility to compensate our executive officers in a manner designed to promote our long term goals and objectives the cngc has not adopted a policy that all compensation must be deductible or have the most favorable tax or accounting treatment available to our company rather the cngc retains the ability to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws do we have employment agreements with our neos except for an agreement with mr duke in connection with his retirement as president and ceo that provides that he will continue to serve as an associate of our company through fiscal described below in potential payments upon termination or change in control we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos our neos and other executive officers are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his or her violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period following his or her termination of employment he or she will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment for purposes of these agreements a competing business generally meansany retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by walmart with annual revenues in excess of certain thresholds these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company we do not have any contracts or other arrangements with our neos that provide for payments or other benefits upon a change in control of our company see potential payments upon termination or change in control beginning on page for more information proxy statement back to contents what types of retirement and other benefits are our neos eligible to receive our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation matching plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our k plan our neos do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or non payment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our mip and our stock incentive plan both provide that we will recoup awards to the extent required by walmart policies furthermore our mip provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the participant must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares in addition both the mip and the sip provide that all awards under these plans whether or not previously paid or deferred will be subject to the companys policies and applicable law regarding clawbacks in effect from time to time are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of ourstock to further align the long term interests of our executives and our shareholders the board has approved stock ownership guidelines applicable to our ceo and other senior officers in june our board strengthened the stock ownership guidelines applicable to our ceo and senior officers as follows our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to seven times his current annual base salary and our other neos and certain other senior officers must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to five times his or her current annual base salary the ceo and other senior officers must satisfy these stock ownership guidelines no later than the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to a position covered by the stock ownership guidelines if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any shares that vest pursuant to any equity award until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines further as noted below any shares that have been pledged will not be counted when determining whether the officer is in compliance with the guidelines the board or the cngc can modify these guidelines in the event of dramatic and unexpected changes in the market value of our shares or in other circumstances that the board or the cngc deem appropriate currently each of our neos is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines as illustrated by the following graph assumes a stock price of share which was the closing price of a share on april includes shares that have vested but have been deferred does not include restricted stock or performance shares that have not yet vested and does not include shares underlying stock options ms brewer and mr ashe have not yet reached their required compliance dates under the stock ownership guidelines proxy statement back to contents are there any restrictions on the ability of our neos to engage in transactions involving company stock yes our insider trading policy contains the following restrictions our directors and executive officers may trade in our stock only during open window periods and then only after they have pre cleared transactions with our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not enter into trading plans pursuant to sec rule b without having such plans pre approved by our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in hedging transactions such as swaps puts and calls collars and similar financial instruments that would eliminate or limit the risks and rewards of walmart stock ownership our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell options puts or calls whether exchange traded or otherwise or engage in any other transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan before using walmart stock as collateral for any other borrowing our directors and executive officers must satisfy the following requirements the pledging arrangement must be pre approved by walmarts corporate secretary and any walmart shares pledged will not be counted when determining whether the director or executive officer is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines currently none of our independent directors or executive officers has any pledging arrangements in place involving walmart stock one outside director has pledged shares representing less than one percent of his sole and shared beneficial ownership as security for a line of credit as disclosed on page under holdings of officers and directors risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally including any risks that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our performance based incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures namely operating income based measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that thismix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our operating income resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe motivate our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold our executive officers cash incentive payments are subject to reduction or elimination if certain compliance objectives are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company proxy statement back to contents

officers can impact and that are likely to have an impact on shareholder value our compensation programs are also designed to balance long term performance with shorter term performance and to mitigate any risk that an executive officer would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single performance measure or company segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of

at the annual shareholders meeting the text of the shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received by our company all statements contained in a shareholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to wal mart stores inc c o gordon y allison vice president and general counsel corporate division southwest th street bentonville arkansas the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals based on broader policy reasons as set forth in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal in our statements in opposition we have not attempted to refute all of the assertions made about walmart in the shareholder proposals proxy statement back to contents proposal no independent chairman resolved the stockholders of wal mart stores inc thecompany ask the board of directors to adopt a policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be a director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these purposes a director shall not be considered independent if during the last three years he or she was or was affiliated with a company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or a significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had a personal service contract s with the company or its senior management was affiliated with a company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or percent of its gross annual revenues from the company had a business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under sec regulations has been employed by a public company at which an executive officer of the company serves as a director had a relationship of the sort described above with an affiliate of the company or was a spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person described above the policy should be implemented without violating any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if a current chairman ceases to be independent between annual shareholder meetings compliance with the policy may be excused if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement we believe the board of directors ability to provide independent oversight of management is compromised when the chairman of the board is not independent we believe that an independent chairman who sets agendas priorities and procedures for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and help ensure the objective functioning of an effective board we view the alternative of having a lead outside director even one with a robust set of duties as adequate only in exceptional circumstances fully disclosed by the board investigations into bribery and corruption at wal marts subsidiaries in mexico china brazil and india along with a recent national labor relations board decision to authorize a nationwide complaint against the company for violations of federal labor law highlight the need for enhanced oversight of wal marts corporate culture and behavior a board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change the millstein center for corporate governance and performance yale school of management noted in its chairing the board report the independent chair curbs conflicts of interest promotes oversight of risk manages the relationship between the board and ceo serves as a conduit for regular communication with shareowners and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board we urge you to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart has always strived to maintain high corporate governance standards in keeping with this goal and unlike most other companies in the fortune the board has separated the roles of chairman and ceo since as stated in our corporate governance guidelines the board has a policy of separating the roles of chairman and ceo as described under the heading board leadership structure above we believe this separation of roles allows our ceo to focus on managing walmarts complex daily operations we also believe that having a separate chairman focused on oversight and governance matters allows the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have a number of other key corporate governance measures in place to see that our board acts independently of management including the following independent presiding director since our board has appointed an independent director to serve as presiding director the board recently expanded the responsibilities of the presiding director to include presiding at meetings of our non management directors and independent directors which are held regularly serving as a liaison between the chairman of the board and the independent directors having the authority to call meetings of directors including separate meetings of the non management directors and independent directors approving board meeting agendas schedules and board meeting related information and being available for consultation with major shareholders generally defined as those holding two percent or more of the companys outstanding common stock when appropriate proxy statement back to contents majority independent board currently of the incumbent members of our board are independent and of the board members are non management directors fully independent key board committees all members of the audit committee and compensation nominating and governance committee are independent the chairs of these committees are heavily engaged in establishing agendas for committee meetings walmart has no plans to rely on any of the governance exemptions available to controlled companies under the nyse listed company rules if and when such exemptions may become available to the company annual board and board committee self assessments as required by our corporate governance guidelines the board and each of the board committees evaluate their organization leadership structure and processes each year to see that the board and board committees are functioning effectively our chairman has more than years of experience with walmart and is well positioned to provide our ceo with guidance advice and counsel regarding walmarts business operations and strategy moreover our chairmans significant ownership stake in our company provides unparalleled alignment with the interests of his fellow shareholders our shareholders have recognized the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re electing our chairman and other board members by wide margins each year we note that the proponent in its supporting statement cites a report by the yale school of managements millstein center for corporate governance and performance chairing the board the case for independent leadership in corporate north america available at http web law columbia edu sites default files microsites millstein center chairing the board final pdf the millstein report far from supporting this proposal a significant portion of the millstein report focuses on the value of separating the roles of chair and ceo a structure that walmart has had in place for more than two decades moreover the millstein report recognizes that there is no one size fits all approach to board leadership the vast majority of advocates of the separation of the roles of chair and ceo recognizes that specific company conditions may warrant the combination under exceptional circumstances in these cases most would agree that companies should explain to shareowners why such an alternative model best serves the long term interests of the corporation and its investors for example a situation in which a company may choose to explain rather than comply with separating the roles may include a family controlled enterprise in which the ceo and chair is the majority shareowner millstein report at for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors board to adopt a policy policy that walmart will disclose annually whether walmart in the previous fiscal year recouped any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or caused a senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as a result of a determination that the senior executive breached a company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the interests of or detrimental to walmart for purposes of this proposal senior executive includes a former senior executive the policy should provide that the general circumstances of the recoupment or forfeiture will be described the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind described above occurred in the previous fiscal year a statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture required by law or regulation supporting statement as long term shareholders we believe that compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation we believe disclosure of the application of recoupment forfeiture provisions would encourage ethical conduct and appropriate risk management at walmart by educating senior executives about behavioral expectations while discouraging future costly compliance violations by communicating concrete consequences for misconduct walmart has mechanisms in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon a finding of misconduct walmarts management incentive plan mip provides that the compensation nominating and governance committee committee may recoup all incentive compensation whether or not previously paid or deferred awarded in the previous months if the committee determines that the recipient engaged in any act deemed inimical to the best interests of walmart or failed to comply with walmarts policies mip sections b and c similarly the stock incentive plan sip provides for forfeiture of outstanding awards and repayment of amounts received in respect of certain plan awards in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to walmarts best interests sip section separation agreements with several recently retired senior executives state that walmart may suspend and recoup payments made under any agreement with the executive if a failure on the executives part to abide by walmarts statement of ethics is discovered proxy statement back to contents walmart never has disclosed whether these recoupment forfeiture provisions have been applied making it difficult for shareholders to hold members of the committee accountable for administering the provisions as of q walmart has incurred million in costs associated with investigations into alleged foreign corrupt practices act violations in mexico china india and brazil k and q q walmart also recently pled guilty to federal and state criminal and civil charges of illegally dumping hazardous materials leading to over million in fines http yosemite epa gov opa admpress nsf d cf a efb fb d d b e cab b aa opendocument recoupment disclosure would allow shareholders to determine whether walmart recouped compensation from any current or former senior executive for similar misconduct walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal because existing sec disclosure rules already require sufficient disclosures regarding walmarts comprehensive recoupment policies and practices the board and our management believe that compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation plans offer letters and other agreements numerous terms and conditions that give us broad rights to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to associates or former associates who have engaged in misconduct we believe that these recoupment rights are broader than those provided to the boards and management of many companies and reflect walmarts strong commitment to ethics and integrity walmarts broad existing recoupment rights include the following our management incentive plan states that a participant must have complied with walmarts policies including our statement of ethics at all times in order to be eligible to receive a cash incentive payment moreover a participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the cngc determines within twelve months of its payment that prior to the awards payment the participant violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts inimical to the best interests of our company our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares the stock incentive plan additionally provides that a participant must reimburse the company if the cngc determines that the participant at any time up to one year after the receipt of an equity award violated any of our policies breached any restrictive covenants or confidentiality obligations or otherwise committed acts inimical to the best interests of our company when an executive officer leaves walmart we generally enter into a separation agreement that states t he associate acknowledges that the associate has complied with the applicable statement of ethics during the associates employment the discovery of a failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle walmart to suspend and recoup any payments paid or due under this agreement or any other agreements between the parties our statement of ethics among other directives forbids all associates from being dishonest acting illegally and having conflicts between the associates work and personal affairs walmart and the board are committed to pursuing recoupment actions against current and former associates believed to have acted unethically we already are required by sec disclosure requirements to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation has been recouped and the amount recouped from our neos moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation policies and compensation decisions regarding the neos we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the reasons for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be recovered further decisions to disclose information taking into account applicable legal requirements the desire of investors to receive information confidentiality and commercial considerations and other matters are properly made on a case by case basis mandating a report would deprive the board of the ability to exercise judgment and discretion with respect to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information as noted above the secs existing disclosure rules already require walmart to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive officers who served during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such individuals meet the secs definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure requirements to all current and former senior executives is warranted in addition recoupment of compensation is not the only sanction that walmart may impose on associates who violate company policies or otherwise act contrary to the best interests of our company for example an associates misconduct may result in his or her immediate termination from the company thus producing the report requested by the proponent which would focus solely on recoupment or forfeiture of incentive or stock compensation could present an incomplete and misleading picture of the full range of the companys alternatives and actions to penalize and deter associate misconduct in sum the board believes that this proposal is unnecessary because existing sec disclosure rules already require sufficient disclosures regarding walmarts comprehensive recoupment policies and practices and because the report requested by the proposal would not include the full range of sanctions used by walmart to address associate misconduct for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no request for annual report on lobbying whereas corporate lobbying exposes our company to risks that could adversely affect the companys stated goals objectives and ultimately shareholder value and whereas we rely on the information provided by our company and therefore have a strong interest in full disclosure of our companys lobbying to evaluate whether it is consistent with our companys expressed goals and in the best interests of shareholders and long term value resolved the shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart request the board authorize the preparation of a report updated annually disclosing company policy and procedures governing lobbying both direct and indirect and grassroots lobbying communications payments by walmart used for a direct or indirect lobbying or b grassroots lobbying communications in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient walmarts membership in and payments to any tax exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation description of managements and the boards decision making process and oversight for making payments described in section and above for purposes of this proposal a grassroots lobbying communication is a communication directed to the general public that a refers to specific legislation or regulation b reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and c encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation indirect lobbying is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which walmart is a member both direct and indirect lobbying and grassroots lobbying communications include efforts at the local state and federal levels the report shall be presented to the audit committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on walmarts website supporting statement as shareholders we encourage transparency and accountability in our companys use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation walmart is reportedly a member of the chamber of commerce which is characterized as by far the most muscular business lobby group in washington chamber of secrets economist april spending more than billion on lobbying since walmart has experienced negative press because of its involvement with the chamber that actively lobbies against the foreign corrupt practices act wal mart took part in lobbying campaign to amend anti bribery law washington post april walmart does not disclose its memberships in or payments to trade associations or the portions of such amounts used for lobbying transparent reporting would reveal whether company assets are being used for objectives contrary to walmarts long term interests walmart spent approximately million in and on direct federal lobbying activities opensecrets org the federal figure does not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states walmart lobbies at the state level with at least lobbyists in states in national institute on money in state politics and walmart does not disclose its membership in tax exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation we urge support for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal walmart already discloses information about its lobbying activities and procedures including the oversight role played by the board as required by existing law regulations and walmart policies the additional disclosures of proprietary and confidential information required by this proposal are unnecessary and would risk putting walmart at a competitive disadvantage our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels we engage with public policymakers at the federal state and local levels when we believe it will serve the best interests of walmart and our shareholders walmart is committed to participating in the political process as a good corporate citizen in this regard walmart has developed effective policies for the appropriate disclosure and oversight of its lobbying activities and is fully committed to complying with all laws concerning lobbying activities including laws requiring public disclosure walmarts lobbying activities and the decision making process relating to such activities are subject to review and oversight as referenced in our global responsibility report our statement regarding political and policy oriented engagement available at http corporate walmart com microsites global responsibility report pdf political and public policy global responsibility report pdf outlines the policies and procedures governing walmarts lobbying activities as reflected in that statement and in the charter of the cngc which is composed only of independent proxy statement back to contents directors the cngc has review and oversight responsibility for walmarts legislative affairs and public policy engagement strategy in addition our government relations policy available at http corporate walmart com government relations policy states that all lobbying activities and other communications with government officials or legislative bodies on behalf of walmart only be made by or as specifically directed by the companys government relations department this policy further directs that walmart corporate funds may not be given to political candidates entities or organizations without the express knowledge and consent of the government relations department walmart also complies with all federal and state reporting requirements governing its lobbying activities under the lobbying disclosure act of as amended walmart submits quarterly reports to congress which outline walmarts federal lobbying activities including lobbying expenditures for the quarter and the specific legislative items that were the topics of communications and identifying the individuals who lobbied on behalf of walmart these reports are available at http lobbyingdisclosure house gov and soprweb senate gov we also provide links to these publicly available reports on our corporate website at http corporate walmart com government relations policy walmart files similar periodic reports with state agencies reflecting state lobbying activities which are also publicly available like most major corporations walmart is a member of certain retail industry and other trade associations that we believe can assist walmart in achieving its long term strategic objectives walmart periodically reviews its memberships in these associations which may sometimes take positions on legislation or communicate with government officials on public policy issues although lobbying is not the primary purpose of these associations the membership dues paid by walmart and other members may be part of the funds they use to engage in lobbying activities walmart may not agree with every lobbying action taken by such associations accordingly the board believes that additional disclosures regarding the specific payments made to these trade associations would not necessarily present an accurate reflection of walmarts positions on certain public policy issues as a result of the boards already having a review and oversight role and walmarts existing disclosures regarding its lobbying activities and procedures the board believes this proposal is unnecessary in addition the board believes this proposal is not in the best interests of walmart and our shareholders we are involved in a number of legislative initiatives that could dramatically affect our business and operations because parties with adverse interests also lobby for their own business reasons any unilaterally expanded disclosure by walmart regarding its lobbying activities could benefit these parties to the detriment of walmart and its shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal other matters our company is not aware of any matters that will be considered at the annual shareholders meeting other than the matters described in this proxy statement if any other matters are properly brought before the annual shareholders meeting the proxy holders will vote the shares as to which they hold proxies in their discretion proxy statement back to contents questions and answers about the

plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors we expect the election of directors at the annual shareholders meeting to be an uncontested election what happens if a director nominee fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election at the annual shareholders meeting any incumbent director who is a director nominee and who does not receive a majority vote must promptly tender his or her offer of resignation as a director for consideration by the board each director standing for reelection at the annual shareholders meeting has agreed to resign effective upon acceptance of such resignation by the board if he or she does not receive a majority vote the board must

effect of an abstain vote or a broker non vote on the proposals to be voted on at the annual shareholders meeting abstentions a share voted abstain with respect to any proposal is considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal but is not considered a vote cast with respect to that proposal therefore an abstention will not have any effect on the election of directors because each of the other proposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote on each such proposal in order to pass an abstention will have the effect of a vote against each of the other proposals broker non votes a broker non vote occurs if your shares are not registered in your name that is you hold your shares in street name and you do not provide the record holder of your shares usually a bank broker or other nominee with voting instructions on any matter as to which under the nyse rules for member organizations such as brokers a broker may not vote without instructions from you but the broker nevertheless provides a proxy for your shares shares as to which a broker non vote occurs are considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists but are not considered votes cast or shares entitled to vote with respect to a voting matter therefore a broker non vote will not have any effect on the outcome of the proposals under the nyse rules for member organizations i the election of directors ii the non binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of the companys neos and iii each of the shareholder proposals described in this proxy statement are not matters on which a broker may vote without your instructions therefore if your shares are not registered in your name and you do not provide instructions to the record holder of your shares regarding these proposals a broker non vote as to your shares will result with respect to these proposals the ratification of the appointment
