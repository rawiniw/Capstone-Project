opened a store in rogers arkansas in he offered low prices so he could serve customers who wanted to save money and live better and he built his business on several core values respecting the individual serving customers well striving for excellence and acting with integrity on this last point he told our associates that integrity has to start with each of us he wanted his company to be a force for good in the community from that first store sam expanded the business across the united states often choosing locations in small rural towns that other companies overlooked walmart grew rapidly by sam had opened stores in the company went public walmart opened its first sams global ethics compliance program report club and first supercenter in the s and by walmart had stores in over half of the states in just after i moved into our home office after working in one of our stores in tulsa oklahoma we opened our first store outside the countryin mexico city where we built a sams club and then a supercenter we soon expanded to argentina brazil canada china and the united kingdom among other places just over twenty five years later walmart operates more than stores in countries around the world more than of those stores are abroad operating under banners such as game in africa best price in india and asda in the u k we are rapidly expanding our ecommerce businesses which currently operate in countries walmart has been one of the worlds largest private employers since and now has million associates roughly of whom work outside of the united states each week we serve over million customers worldwide because of this growth we can now make life more affordable for customers around the world and also improve the lives of people who grow or make the products we sell yet our success also creates a unique challenge for sam waltons values to permeate and animate a world wide business all of our associatesfrom management at the home office in bentonville to associates in stores in north america south america europe africa and asiamust know and follow our high ethical standards global ethics compliance program report to that end we have been reshaping walmarts ethics and compliance program over the last five years we established an integrated worldwide structure to enhance transparency and accountability we built processes aided by innovative technology systems to ensure that acting in the right way is part of the company culture and we are taking similar steps to promote integrity with our many business partners particularly those that interact with governments for us im proud that walmart has matured to the point where our company is recognized as a leader in ethics and compliance as we pass the five year milestone of this journey its a good time to look back review what weve learned and make plans for the future consolidating and enhancing walmarts ethics and compliance program our effort to unify and professionalize our ethics and compliance program is one of the most significant enhancements in walmarts corporate governance over the last few years we determined at the beginning of this reorganization process that our companys ethics and compliance function should be consolidated into one global group rather than establishing separate compliance teams that reported to each of our market or divisional business leaders we also decided that the program needed to support but operate independently of local business management we implemented this change by appointing chief ethics and compliance officers and anti corruption directors within each of our retail markets and organizing them and their staff into one global organization with this change our company gained a clearer view into our ethics and compliance issues and increased consistency in our standards and processes so that all walmart stores and associates are held to the companys high compliance expectations in restructuring our ethics and compliance program we understood that each of our businesses would need both subject matter experts and teams to put our policies into practice given local conditions and laws weve been engaged in a multi year effort to appoint and train ethics and compliance associates throughout our business the process of tailoring our compliance resources to meet the needs of our business global ethics compliance program report is never ending but our ethics and compliance team has reached a high level of maturity our dedicated ethics and compliance staff now numbers over associates including over in the united states and over in our international markets and offices in light of our business size we realized that technology would be essential to make our governance programs efficient and reliable accordingly weve spent significant time and resources developing and deploying electronic systems to implement our anti corruption policies obtain and monitor our licenses and permits enhance food safety track our donations to the community provide training to our associates and comply with our anti money laundering obligations among other functions since weve invested more than million in global ethics and compliance systems we are seeing strong results from these investments in people and systems our licensing and permitting processes provide just one example of how these improvements are helping us to effectively manage our business walmart is required to apply for more than licenses to operate our facilities outside the u s to meet this need we have created licensing teams in each international market numbering more than associates in total these dedicated teams have developed processes to monitor and track our licenses and permits in each market using a centralized licensing system that the company created and deployed over the last four years this system reduces the risk of error or wrongdoing by organizing our workflows and implementing safeguards such as requirements for approvals and documentation for paying required fees the system also provides a repository for licensing information thereby creating transparency and enabling the company to monitor compliance with both global policy and local procedures providing effective methods for raising ideas questions and concerns as weve enhanced our governance programs weve paid particular attention to whether were providing associates with avenues to submit ideas for improving our business ask questions and raise concerns walmart has long had an open door policy that invites associates to contact managers in the company with ideas questions or concerns global ethics compliance program report without fear of retaliation we also maintain several resources for associates confidentially and anonymously if they prefer to make these types of contacts with our ethics compliance team these include email an online portal a mailing address and a helpline available hours a day these contact mechanisms are equipped to handle most languages spoken in the places we do business over the last few years weve stepped up our efforts to educate associates about these resources these efforts have been successful between and the contacts weve received through our ethics program have increased over engaging business leaders and associates in a culture of integrity building our formal ethics and compliance function and instituting high standards and detailed procedures is not enough in addition to effective processes we must have a culture of integrity every associate who works at walmart has a part in doing business honestly and ethically for integrity to start with each one of us it cant just be the job of a single team our ethics compliance and risk committees have proven to be an effective tool to keep our leaders throughout the company involved in that work walmarts most senior executives are members of the companys global ethics compliance and risk committee we meet regularlymore than quarterly and over times since we discuss current issues related to ethics compliance and other enterprise level risks we structure the meetings to ensure follow up and accountability for our action items each of walmarts retail markets has its own similar committee these committees correspondingly consist of the markets senior management and its ethics and compliance leaders including both the market ceo and the market chief ethics and compliance officer the open and continuous dialog created by these committee discussions has kept our management teams active in managing our risks and developing our culture of course associates in every position and in every market need to appreciate and apply walmarts commitment to integrity in their daily global ethics compliance program report work not just our company leadership so we continually strive to train associates recognize and award contributions to our culture of integrity and address problems that arise we discuss our values and teach their practical application through a program of online and in person sessions for several years weve been building a global learning management system to promote engagement and comprehension the system allows us to deliver training tailored for specific business roles and to track results it also helps us train in multiple languages in addition to this system we use a variety of ways to engage our associates to maximize the comprehensiveness of our training program last year we engaged more than million associates in the u s alone on issues relating to ethics and integrity enhancing oversight the active oversight of our board of directors has been key to the progress weve made in corporate governance as ive noted in prior reports on our ethics and compliance improvements several committees of our board actively oversee elements of our ethics and compliance efforts the audit committee oversees the global ethics and compliance program meeting directly and regularly with the programs leaders and setting annual high level compliance objectives the committee assigns each of these objectives to one or more senior executives and then monitors the companys progress for the last four years the boards compensation committee has conditioned a portion of our most senior executives compensation on making adequate progress on these annual compliance goals last year the audit committee determined that the company had made adequate progress on the objectives that had been set since walmart began this practice in the company has achieved over of these board level objectives including over objectives that related specifically to our anti corruption program utilizing technology to deliver food safety and freshness customers are looking for freshness and quality in choosing where to buy their food this last year we accelerated our use of technology global ethics compliance program report and data to meet that need for several years we have been deploying an electronic system to monitor the temperatures of the foods in our stores its essential to maintain the right temperature for each type of fresh food over the last year we installed the system in additional stores the system is active throughout the u s and in many of our international markets we record over four million food temperatures each month in the u s alone these electronic data help us track trends identify issues and maintain our food at optimal temperatures delivering fresh food is a central part of our plan to serve our customers and differentiate ourselves from competitors so we will continue investing in this and other initiatives to lead in food quality and safety in the year ahead emphasizing anti corruption as a company we continue to emphasize anti corruption our global anti corruption policy prohibits anyone from offering giving or receiving anything of value to gain an improper benefit for the company we are constantly working to give that policy life in our daily business we invest significant resources into ensuring that our associates understand and follow the anti corruption policy and the related procedures that apply to their jobs in the past year alone we provided anti corruption training to more than associates focusing on those who are most likely to interact with governmental officials we also expanded our efforts to train and audit our third party intermediaries which are individuals or businesses that interact with governmental entities on our behalf we have a stringent program to identify and screen these companies to supplement that screening last year we expanded our pioneering auditing program for third party intermediaries these audits examined the records policies and practices of a sample of companies drawn from each of our retail markets worldwide through our anti corruption initiatives we strive not only to achieve the highest standards of integrity in our own business but also to normalize these high standards of conduct in the global business marketplace leading on anti corruption benefits not only walmart and our associates but also the communities in which we operate and live global ethics compliance program report our work is not done over the past five years we have invested to become a better company and a better neighbor we created a comprehensive and effective ethics and compliance program to continuously improve our business we restructured our personnel and processes to increase transparency and accountability and we sent the message to everyone working at or with walmart that integrity is not negotiable we are measuring our progress in these efforts and frequently seek external advice and feedback last summer new york stock exchange governance services recognized walmart for having the best governance risk and compliance program at a large cap company concluding that we are demonstrat ing how governance risk and compliance programs are ingrained in the culture of a large cap company from the top down this external validation helps us know that were on the right path but walmart is a large complex and vital company so we must continue identifying and meeting the risks of our business we must continue improving our ethics and compliance program through technological and other innovations maintaining it as a worldwide leader and we must continue to create a culture for our associates and affiliates that would make sam walton proud doug mcmillon president and ceo walmart april global ethics compliance program report
