gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non usd acquisitions until owned for months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for

comparable period free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billionfor the nine months endedoctober which decreased when compared to billionfor the nine months endedoctober primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and u s associate payroll as well as the inclusion of flipkart operations we generated free cash flow of billionfor the nine months endedoctober which decreased whencompared to billionfor the nine months ended october due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as billion in increased capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months ended october dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow adjusted epsadjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to walmart adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com and a non cash impairment charge related to the jabong com trade name we adjust for the unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com becausealthough the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com additionally management does not forecast changes in fair value of its equity investments accordingly management adjusts eps for the unrealized jd com investment gains and losses we also adjusted eps for an impairment charge related to the jabong com trade name as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the myntra com fashion platform three months ended october diluted earnings per share reported eps adjustments pre tax impacttax impact nci impact net

to the provisional amount recorded in the third quarter of fiscal related to tax reform and unrealized gains and losses on our jd com investment the provisional measurement period related to tax

investment roi as measures to assess returns on assets management believes roi is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively the increase in roa was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months primarily resulting from lapping the billion net loss in fiscal related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil the change in fair value of the investment in jd com and lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to flipkart roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively the increase in roi was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily as a result of lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal offset by the dilution to operating income related to flipkart the denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the flipkart acquisition was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of asu leases asu since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period upon adoption of asu rent for the trailing months multiplied by a factor of is no longer included in the calculation of roi on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized for fiscal lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date rather than averaged because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing months multiplied by a factor of a two point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard further beginning prospectively in fiscal rent expense in the numerator excludes short term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right of use asset balance non gaap measures roi cont prior to adoption of asu we defined roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases because the new lease standard was adopted prospectively as of february our calculation of roi for the comparable fiscal period was not recast our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi as mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa is as follows calculation of return on assets calculation of return on investment trailing twelve months trailing twelve months ended october ended october dollars in millions dollars in millions numerator numerator consolidated net income operating income denominator interest income average total assets depreciation and amortization return on assets roa rent adjusted operating income october denominator certain balance sheet data average total assets average accumulated depreciation total assets and amortization leased assets net np average accounts payable total assets without leased assets net np average accrued liabilities accumulated depreciation and amortization rent x n a accumulated amortization on leased assets np average invested capital accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets np return on investment roi accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by average total assets as used in roa includes the average impact of the adoption of asu for the twelve months ended october as a result of adopting asu average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets net plus leased assets net as of october average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of october np not provided upon adoption of asu leases a factor of eight times rent is no longer included in the calculation of roi on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now recorded on the consolidated balance sheet the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by the average is based on the addition of total assets without leased assets net at the end of the current period to total assets without leased assets net at the end of the prior period and dividing by plus leased assets net at the end of the current period the average is based on the addition of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets at the end of the current period to accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased assets at the end of the prior period and dividing by plus accumulated amortization on leased assets at the end of the current period np not provided non gaap measures free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billion for the nine months ended october which decreased when compared billion for the nine months ended october primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and u s associate payroll as well as the inclusion of flipkart operations we generated free cash flow of billion for the nine months ended october which decreased when compared to billion for the twelve months ended october due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as well as billion in increased capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months ended october dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow non gaap measures constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non usd acquisitions until owned for months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three and

comparable period non gaap measures adjusted eps adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to walmart adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com and a non cash impairment charge related to the jabong com trade name we adjust for the unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com becausealthough the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com additionally management does not forecast changes in fair value of its equity investments accordingly management adjusts eps for the unrealized jd com investment gains and losses we also adjusted eps for an impairment charge related to the jabong com trade name as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the myntra com fashion platform percent percent three months ended october change nine

of the noncontrolling interest at flipkart non gaap measures adjusted eps as previously disclosed in our third quarter ended october press release we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months
