information at the end of this release regarding non gaap financial measures wal mart stores inc reconciliations of and other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billionand billionfor the nine months endedoctober and respectively we generated free cash flow of billionand billionfor the nine months endedoctober and respectively the decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were due to the timing of payments and an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping prior year s improvements in working capital management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months endedoctober dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities reclassifications made due to the adoption of asu improvements to employee share based payment accounting net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar non usd entities into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions of non usd entities if any until such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations of non usd entities the table below

exchange rate fluctuations n a n a n a n aconstant currency operating income change versus prior year comparable period adjusted epsthe adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three month period ended october is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because the adjusted eps for each such period excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for such period management believes that the adjusted eps for the three month period ended october is a meaningful measure to share with investors because that measure which adjusts eps for such period for certain items recorded in such period is the measure that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition the measure affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance for the three month period ended october and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following the loss on the early extinguishment of certain debt the fcpa accrual based on discussions with government agencies regarding the possible resolution of the fcpa matter and the impairment of certain properties due to our decision to exit those properties in one of our international markets adjusted eps for the three months ended october is a non gaap financial measure the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps for the three months ended october three months

net adjustments adjusted eps calculated based on nature of item and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdiction adjusted eps guidanceadjusted eps guidance is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes that adjusted eps guidance for fiscal is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items to be recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for fiscal to the comparable prior period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmart s core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated adjusted eps guidance for fiscal by adjusting for the amount of the impact of the loss on the early extinguishment of certain debt the fcpa accrual based on discussions with government agencies regarding the possible resolution of the fcpa matter the gain on the sale of suburbia in mexico and the impairment of certain properties due to our decision to exit those properties in one of our

the week period ended october and october and our guidance for comparable sales for the week period ending january in each case calculated or forecasted by excluding fuel sales for such periods the comparable sales measures excluding fuel are non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec s rules we believe the most directly comparable financial measures computed in accordance with gaap are the comparable sales calculated by including fuel sales for the corresponding periods we believe that the presentation of the comparable sales measures excluding fuel provides useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of the fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on walmart u s and sam s club s comparable sales for the periods presented ex earningspresentation htm earnings presentation earningspresentation safe harbor and non gaap

global compliance program and organizational enhancements total in fiscal year we expect our third party fcpa and compliance related expenses to range between and million these amounts are included in our corporate and support expenses these amounts exclude the accrual made in the third quarter of fy non gaap measures roi we include return on assets roa which is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap as well as return on investment roi as measures to assess returns on assets management believes roi is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively the decline in roa was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income the decline in roi was primarily due to the decrease in operating income we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows wal mart stores inc return on assets and return on investment trailing twelve months ended trailing twelve months ended october october dollars in millions dollars in millions calculation of return on assets calculation of return on investment numerator numerator consolidated net income operating income denominator interest income average total assets depreciation and amortization return on assets roa rent adjusted operating income as of october denominator certain balance sheet data average total assets total assets average accumulated depreciation and amortization accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable accounts payable average accrued liabilities accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by non gaap measures free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billion and billion for the nine months ended october and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion and billion for the nine months ended october and respectively the decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were due to the timing of payments and an increase in incentive payments as well as lapping prior years improvements in working capital management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months ended october dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities reclassifications have been made due to the adoption of asu improvements to employee share based payment accounting net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow change versus prior year comparable period non gaap measures constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar non usd entities into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions of non usd entities if any until such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmarts underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations of non usd entities the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net

measures from the respective comparable prior year period comparable sales of sams club and walmart u s for the week and week periods ended october and projected comparable sales for the week period ending january in each case calculated by excluding fuel sales for such periods are non gaap financial measures we believe the net sales gross profit rate and operating income for the three and nine months ended october the percentage changes in those financial measures from the respective comparable prior year period comparable sales for the week and week periods ended october and projected comparable sales for the week period ending january in each case calculated by including fuel sales for such period are respectively the financial measures computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to the non gaap financial measures described above we believe that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures with respect to sams club and walmart u s described above provides useful information to investors regarding walmarts financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on sams clubs net sales and operating income and on sams clubs and walmart u s s comparable sales for the periods presented non gaap measures fuel impact cont

weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended walmart u s sams club the adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps for the three and nine month periods ended october is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules because the adjusted eps for each such period excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for the three and nine month periods ended october management believes that adjusted eps for the three and nine month periods ended october is a meaningful measure to share with investors because that measure which adjusts eps for such periods for certain items recorded in such periods is the measure that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable periods in addition the measure affords investors a view of what management considers walmarts core earnings performance for the three and nine month periods ended october and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for the comparable periods we have calculated adjusted eps for
