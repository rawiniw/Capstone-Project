a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets that a plan has the ability to access level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level significant unobservable inputs the asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs there have been no changes in the methodologies used at january and during the year ended january there were no transfers of financial instruments into or out of level or level the plan had no level measurements during the year ended january or following is a description of the valuation methodologies used

letter from the treasury dated june stating that the plan is qualified under sections a of the puerto rico internal revenue code of and section of the puerto rico internal revenue code of once qualified the plan is required to operate in conformity with the puerto rico code to maintain its qualified status processes are in place to prevent operational failures but when they occur the administrator takes corrective action to preserve the tax qualification of the plan specifically the administrator has corrected and will continue to correct operational failures in a manner permitted under the treasury in order to preserve the plan s tax favored qualification although the plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter the administrator and the plan s tax counsel believe that the plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the puerto rico code and therefore believe that the plan is qualified and the related trust is tax exempt risks and uncertaintiesthe custodian holds the plan s investments and executes all investment transactions the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market volatility and credit risks the plan attempts to limit these risks by authorizing and offering participants a broad range of investment options that are invested in high quality securities or are offered and administered by reputable and known investment companies due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported on the statements of net assets available for benefits the plan s exposure to a concentration of risk is limited by the diversification of investments across multiple investment fund options additionally the investments within each investment fund option are further diversified into varied financial instruments table of contents reconciliation of financial
