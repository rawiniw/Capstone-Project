considers a variety of factors in setting total direct compensation for our neos including the overall financial and operating performance of our company and its operating segments and or areas of responsibility each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones the performance of each executives business unit or function against pre determined financial objectives each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience our overall succession planning and the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future and peer group benchmarking data and compensation analyses how is peer group data used by the cmdc the cmdc reviews publicly available compensation information from peer companies when establishing tdc for our executives historically we used a combination of three peer groups a retail peer group a top market capitalization peer group and a select fortune peer group when establishing tdc the rationale for using three separate peer groups was to account for walmarts size extensive international presence and complex operations which result in our neos jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at most retailers and other peer companies in early fiscal with the assistance of pay governance the cmdc developed a new simpler and more focused peer group to replace the three peer groups used in the past this new peer group aims to reflect a cross industry sample of the largest u s based companies including large retailers and companies with significant and complex international operations these peer group companies were selected using the following multi step screening process ceo compensation peer group screening methodology table of contents executive compensation applying this methodology our new peer group consisted of the following companies amerisourcebergen corporation anthem inc apple inc att inc bank of america corporation the boeing company cardinal health inc caterpillar inc chevron corporation citigroup inc comcast corporationcostco wholesale corporation cvs

phillips the proctor gamble company target corporation unitedhealth group incorporated united technologies corporation united parcel service inc valero energy corporation verizon communications inc walgreens boots alliance inc the walt disney company wells fargo company while we believe that the new peer group provides a simplified and more straightforward comparison to a broad range of companies with complex international operations walmart is still significantly larger than the peer group median by most measures as shown in the following chart walmart positioning relative to compensation peer group as of fiscal year end the cmdc uses benchmarking data as a general guide to setting appropriately competitive compensation consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation while the benchmarking data generally are used for comparable positions the cmdc also reviews peer group data for retail ceo positions for purposes of benchmarking the compensation of our executives who lead our operating segments these executives have significant responsibilities and lead organizations that considered separately from the rest of our company are larger than many of the other retailers in the peer group and we believe that these positions are often comparable to or carry greater responsibilities than ceo positions at many of our peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint we believe that it is more likely that these leaders would be recruited for a ceo position in the retail industry or elsewhere rather than for a lateral move to lead an operating segment of a company therefore the cmdc also benchmarks these executives compensation against the compensation of ceos within our peer group proxy statement table of contents executive

to our key strategic priorities and operational goals as described under fiscal neo pay and performance summaries beginning on page ceo pay and performance alignment the cmdc reviews an assessment by pay governance regarding the alignment of our ceos pay with our companys performance including the appropriateness of our ceos pay opportunity compared to peers and the alignment of our ceos realizable pay and our performance relative to our peer group companies this assessment concluded that our ceos most recent fiscal year fiscal and three year fiscal pay opportunity and realizable pay are aligned with walmarts performance over the same time periods tally sheets the cmdc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys global people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation realizable by each neo for the upcoming fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company how does shareholder feedback impact executive compensation our board actively seeks and values feedback from shareholders over the past several years in addition to our day to day interactions with investors we have expanded our shareholder engagement to include an annual outreach program focused on strategy governance executive compensation and other topics suggested by our shareholders since our annual shareholders meeting we invited our largest institutional shareholders to participate in this outreach program and we ultimately engaged with shareholders representing approximately million shares or approximately of our public float we also had conversations with the leading proxy advisory firms say on pay support this engagement gave us an opportunity to discuss our strategy our commitment to corporate governance and executive compensation best practices how our governance and compensation practices help to support our strategy and our commitment to sustainability and shared value while our shareholders expressed a wide range of perspectives in these meetings we received generally positive feedback on our strategy our changes to our board and committee structure over the past few years to support that strategy our executive compensation program and recent enhancements to our proxy statement disclosures additionally our say on pay proposal received support the feedback we have received from our shareholders including the results of our say on pay proposal is regularly communicated to the cmdc the ngc and the board we believe that the results of our say on pay proposals over the past several years also indicate that shareholders generally are supportive of our executive compensation program and therefore the cmdc made no material changes to our executive compensation program as a result of this vote table of contents executive compensation fiscal performance metrics what financial performance metrics are used in our incentive programs and why did the cmdc select these metrics our neos performance based pay for fiscal was based on achieving objective pre established financial goals for the following metrics fiscal financial performance metrics annual cash incentive long term performance equity for purposes of our incentive programs total company and international sales operating income and roi are calculated on a constant currency basis and exclude certain items such as revenue from fuel sales see page for more information the cmdc concluded that the metrics described above are aligned with our larger enterprise strategy and appropriate and effective in driving results tied to shareholder value in reaching this conclusion the cmdc considered the following factors these performance metrics are aligned with our enterprise strategy and can be impacted by our executives unlike metrics tied to stock price or shareholder return our executives can have a direct impact on our sales operating income and roi furthermore unlike earnings per share and other share based metrics sales operating income and roi are not materially impacted by our share repurchase program these metrics are important for judging retail performance sales operating income and roi measures historically have been and continue to be important indicators of retail performance and we believe that our performance in these areas is important to our shareholders the cmdc believes that success with respect to these metrics will support shareholder value over the long term the cmdcs independent compensation consultant has reviewed the historical correlation of various performance metrics and tsr within the retail industry and found that the metrics used in our incentive plans generally are aligned with tsr performance over time additionally our historical performance with respect to these metrics has generally correlated with our stock price over the long term we believe that strong performance with respect to these metrics should translate into shareholder value creation over time the cmdc believes that relative tsr and other relative performance metrics are not the best way to incentivize our executives there are several key differences in our business compared to other publicly traded retailers in the u s including our size our significant international operations our product mix and our variety of formats while the cmdc closely monitors walmarts performance relative to that of our peers when making compensation decisions the cmdc believes that the best approach for walmart is to tie our executive compensation to performance metrics that are aligned with our strategy and operating plans and that can be directly impacted by our executives the combination of these performance metrics mitigates risk using a combination of performance metrics mitigates the risk that our executives could be motivated to pursue results with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if management were to prioritize increasing sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact profitability resulting increases in incentive pay based on sales should be offset by decreases in incentive pay based on operating income and roi proxy statement table of contents executive compensation what non financial metrics were used to assess the performance of our neos for fiscal and how can these metrics impact neo pay culture diversity and inclusion since fiscal our neos and most other associates with responsibilities for managing other associates have had objectives under our culture diversity and inclusion program the cmdc established these objectives because it believes that diversity and inclusion contribute to an engaged and effective workforce for fiscal our culture diversity and inclusion goals program included objectives related to mentoring and sponsorship participation in diversity and inclusion events and development of business specific diversity and inclusion plans associates subject to our culture diversity and inclusion goals program have of their annual performance evaluation tied to diversity and inclusion as noted on page individual performance is a factor considered by the cmdc in setting tdc additionally associates annual cash incentive payment may be reduced by up to if they engage in behavior inconsistent with our discrimination and harassment policies based on the report of our chief culture diversity and inclusion officer the cmdc determined that each neo satisfied his or her diversity goals for fiscal for more information about walmarts commitment to diversity and inclusion and key diversity and inclusion initiatives please see walmarts most recent culture diversity and inclusion report which can be found on our corporate website under the section titled esg investors ethics and compliance goals since fiscal our executive officers cash incentive payments have also been subject to achieving adequate progress in implementing enhancements to the companys global compliance program now known as our ethics and compliance program our company is committed to having and maintaining a strong and effective global ethics and compliance program in every country in which we operate consistent with that commitment over the past few years our company has made significant improvements to our ethics and compliance program around the world in early fiscal our companys senior leadership with input from the audit committee again developed objectives for implementing further enhancements to our global ethics and compliance program these objectives covered various subject matters including anti corruption health and safety food safety environmental compliance and licensing and permits at the conclusion of fiscal the audit committee determined that in its qualitative judgment adequate progress had been achieved in implementing these objectives and reported its determination to the cmdc factors relied on by the audit committee in making this determination included the progress achieved on workstreams in a variety of ethics and compliance areas and the extent to which that progress reflected sustainable long term change in the companys people processes systems and culture based on the qualitative assessment of the audit committee the cmdc determined not to exercise negative discretion to reduce or eliminate the cash incentive payments to any of our executive officers for fiscal for more information about our global ethics and compliance program and related initiatives please see the most recent letter from our ceo which can be found on our corporate website under the section titled esg investors table of contents executive compensation incentive goal setting philosophy and process how does the cmdc set performance goals performance goals are established in the context of and consistent with the companys enterprise strategy financial operating plans and financial guidance each fiscal year this process begins with the boards review of the companys overall enterprise strategy and long term financial plan beginning in the spring and culminating at an annual board strategic planning meeting following the strategic planning meeting the annual operating plans of the company and each of its operating segments are established with spfc and board input the cmdc then establishes performance goals under our annual and long term incentive programs that are consistent with these operating plans incentive plans informed by strategic and financial planning process long range planningapril september annual operating planseptember january incentive plansseptember march assess competitive landscape and macro trends refine enterprise strategy and segment specific initiatives develop annual operating plan in light of long range planning and strategic initiatives review strategy and planned capital expenditures review choice of incentive metrics to ensure that they support enterprise strategy establish performance goals aligned with annual operating plan and guidance in fiscal we articulated our strategy to become the first retailer to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale we began executing on this strategy by making significant multi year investments in our people technology and ecommerce supply chain to improve our customers experience today while positioning walmart for sustainable growth in the future we also continued to focus on managing our global portfolio by closing certain underperforming stores and selling certain assets while also continuing our investments in our associates technology and ecommerce in late fiscal we provided greater visibility into the long term implications of our strategy by announcing our year financial plan at that time highlights of our year financial plan included adding billion to billion in sales growth over a three year period generating approximately billion in operating cash flow over a three year period investing an incremental billion over two years in u s associate wage and training initiatives and investing several billion dollars over a three year period in lower prices for our u s customers as a result of our strategic investments operating income and earnings per share were expected to decline in the short term consistent with our long term financial plan in february we provided specific guidance regarding earnings per share for fiscal which we estimated would be between and per share in march of the cmdc established sales operating income and roi goals for fiscal under our incentive plans consistent with our guidance for example the total company target operating income and sales goals for fiscal were as follows incentive metric fiscal target goal in millions change from fiscal excluding currency fuel sams club tobacco and recentecommerce acquisitions total company operating income total company sales proxy statement table of contents executive compensation these incentive goals were established with the intent that performance in line with our operating plans and guidance should result in payouts approximately at target in order to achieve the maximum payout goals our performance would have to exceed our operating plans to a significant degree threshold performance goals are set at a level that is attainable and below which the company could not justify a payout the cmdcs independent compensation consultant annually evaluates the difficulty of our target performance goals and has consistently found these goals to be challenging additionally over the past ten years under both our annual and long term incentive plans our performance has exceeded target incentive goals in five years and fallen short of target incentive goals in five years we believe this is further evidence of the effectiveness of our goal setting process in establishing performance goals that are appropriately challenging why does the cmdc set goals each year under our long term equity incentive program the cmdc has found that setting long term equity performance goals each year with awards having a three year vesting period is the most effective approach for our long term equity incentive program for the following reasons as the largest global retailer walmarts operating results are significantly impacted by macroeconomic and regional economic factors that may change drastically and that are outside of managements control these economic factors the rapidly evolving retail industry and our own ongoing strategic transformation make it difficult to forecast accurately over a three year period we believe that performance goals cease to be an effective tool in motivating performance if the goals either become unrealistic or too easy to achieve due to macroeconomic factors beyond the control of our executives or due to changes in our strategy and related investments while some companies attempt to address the impact of macroeconomic factors by using relative goals in their long term incentive plans the cmdc has determined that relative goals are not the right approach for walmart for the reasons described on page the cmdc regularly reviews walmarts performance relative to peers and the relative alignment of pay and performance to ensure that our incentive programs are operating as intended another advantage of this approach is that it is more easily understandable and results in performance goals that are better aligned with our strategic transformation the cmdc believes this approach is more effective in motivating performance our incentive goals are aligned with our enterprise strategy business plan and expectations regarding financial performance these expectations necessarily change from year to year based on macroeconomic conditions strategic investments and other factors for example if we were to set three year sales goals this would result in a situation in which our leaders have three differing sales goals at any one time one for each outstanding tranche of performance equity we believe this approach would potentially be confusing and undermine the effectiveness of our performance equity program the cmdc believes that combining annual performance goals with a three year vesting period effectively balances long term focus with clear and understandable performance goals beginning with the awards granted in january the cmdc simplified our long term equity program by providing for a one year performance period followed by an additional two year time based vesting period table of contents executive compensation fiscal performance

equity payout proxy statement table of contents executive compensation why do the results used in our incentive plans differ from our reported results of operations for fiscal the cmdcs objective in administering our incentive plans is to ensure that incentive awards are calculated on a comparable basis from year to year and to ensure that plan participants are incentivized and rewarded appropriately for performance within their control the cmdc undertakes a rigorous oversight and certification process to determine the items to exclude from our reported results of operations for purposes of our incentive plans this process is not outcome driven and includes both positive and negative adjustments to reported results of operations for these reasons the following types of items are excluded from our incentive goals and or our incentive calculations items excluded by the terms of the incentive plans like many other companies our shareholder approved incentive plans specify that incentive payouts be calculated by excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures restructurings and store closings and items that similarly impact our operating results for fiscal these items represented the substantial majority of the difference between our reported operating income and our operating income as calculated for incentive plan purposes the largest single exclusion representing a majority of the difference between reported operating income and operating income for incentive plan purposes was the exclusion of losses and expenses related to the acquisition of flipkart during fiscal items excluded at the time incentive goals are established when the cmdc sets incentive goals it typically excludes the impact of certain items from the performance goals for example because as a matter of policy we generally do not hedge for currency exchange rate fluctuations the cmdc sets incentive goals on a pegged currency basis excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations similarly sales goals exclude the impact of fuel sales because fuel prices are volatile and subject to significant fluctuation which is out of our managements control also in light of our significant ongoing investments in ecommerce when the cmdc established fiscal operating income goals for our operating segments it limited the impact of certain operating losses attributable to the ecommerce operations of those operating segments for incentive plan purposes in order to encourage our segment leaders to make these necessary investments losses from ecommerce operations are not limited for purposes of total company incentive goals for fiscal items excluded at the time incentive goals were established represented the substantial majority of the difference between our reported sales and our sales as calculated for incentive plan purposes items excluded so that operating results are calculated on a comparative basis from year to year consistent with the terms of our incentive plans the cmdc may exclude certain other items so that results can be calculated on a comparative basis from year to year during fiscal these included among others the impact of hurricanes as well as an adjustment to reflect that certain technology infrastructure investments included in our fiscal operating plan were not utilized during fiscal on a net basis this category of adjustments did not have a significant impact on fiscal incentive results impact of excluded items on fiscal performance for incentive plan purposes as described above and shown below by a significant margin the largest items excluded from our fiscal reported results of operations consisted of i items automatically excluded by the terms of our plans such as the impact of acquisitions divestitures and restructurings and ii items pre determined to be excluded at the time incentive goals were set such as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations fuel sales and certain ecommerce losses

currently a part of our executive compensation program if and when we grant stock options in the future the exercise price will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant does the cmdc take tax consequences into account when setting executive compensation section m of the internal revenue code generally places a million limit on the amount of compensation a company can deduct in any one year for certain executive officers while the cmdc considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation the cmdc also looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible by walmart for tax purposes historically our annual cash incentive opportunities and performance based equity awards granted to our executive officers were designed in a manner intended to be exempt from the deduction limitation of section m because they were paid based on the achievement of pre determined performance goals established by the cmdc pursuant to our shareholder approved incentive plans additionally the cmdc had adopted a policy requiring our covered employees subject to section m to defer annual restricted stock grants until after they separate from employment from walmart subject to certain exceptions table of contents executive compensation federal legislation signed into law on december referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act repealed the exemption from section m s deduction limit for performance based compensation effective for taxable years beginning after december in addition the tax act expanded the group of covered employees under section m to include the chief financial officer and mandated that once an individual is treated as a covered employee for a given year that individual will be treated as a covered employee for all subsequent years accordingly any compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of million in any one year regardless of employment status will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of november despite the cmdcs efforts to structure incentive compensation in a manner intended to be exempt from section m and therefore not subject to its deduction limits because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of section m as revised by the tax act including the uncertain scope of the transition relief applicable to certain outstanding arrangements no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from section m will in fact be exempt further the cmdc reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from section m if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the objectives of our executive compensation program do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos our neos are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a non competition agreement with each neo as described in more detail under potential payments upon termination or change in control on page these agreements provide that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his or her violation of company policy we will generally make limited severance payments to the neo under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a period of time following his or her termination of employment he or she will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment for purposes of these agreements a competing business generally means any retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by walmart with annual revenues in excess of certain thresholds these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period of time after leaving our company we do not have any contracts or other arrangements with our neos that provide for payments or other benefits upon a change in control of our company does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or non payment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our mip and our stock incentive plan both provide that we will recoup awards to the extent required by walmart policies furthermore our mip provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our global statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cmdc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the participant must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cmdc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested equity awards in addition both the mip and the stock incentive plan provide that all awards under these plans whether or not previously paid or deferred

their financial interests against the financial interests of our company our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan before using

included in this proxy statement and based on that review and discussion the cmdc recommended to the board that the cda be included in this proxy statement the cmdc submits this report stephen j easterbrook carla a harris marissa a mayer steven s reinemund chair table of contents executive compensation risk considerations in our compensation program the cmdc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally including any risks that may arise from our compensation program we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation our performance based compensation is balanced between an annual incentive and a long term incentive program we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our incentive compensation programs reward performance based on a mix of operating income based metrics sales based metrics and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance metrics mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one metric to the detriment of performance under other metrics for example our long term performance share plan is based equally on sales and roi performance we believe that this structure mitigates any incentive to pursue strategies that would increase our sales at the detriment of roi performance the cmdc regularly reviews the mix and weightings of the performance metrics used in our incentive compensation programs and has concluded that they are aligned with our strategy and provide appropriate incentives to encourage sustainable shareholder value creation maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at and of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating segment or area of responsibility to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to robust stock ownership guidelines which we believe motivate our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold our executive officers cash incentive payments are subject to reduction or elimination if compliance objectives are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain robust clawback provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if an associate has not complied with our policies including our global statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company compensation

adopt a variety of methodologies apply certain exclusions and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations as discussed on pages above our company is unique because we are significantly larger than most of our peer group companies in terms of revenue market capitalization and the size and scope of our worldwide associate population therefore our reported pay ratio may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in industries scope of international operations business models and scale as well as the different estimates assumptions and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their respective pay ratios as permitted by sec rules we used the same median associate that was identified in the preparation of our pay ratio disclosure last year the median associate because we believe there has been no change in our associate population or associate compensation arrangements that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure for fiscal annual total compensation of our ceo was annual total compensation of our median associate was and the ratio of these amounts was below is a brief description of how we identified the median associate last year associate population last year we identified our median associate using our associate population as of december when we employed

associate population of approximately was considered the considered population in determining our median associate last year identifying our median associate in determining our median associate last year we used calendar year gross earnings meaning total amounts paid before deductions or adjustments including wages overtime bonuses and the value of any equity awards that vested and were paid to an associate during calendar year adjustments were made to annualize the gross earnings of all newly hired permanent associates in the considered population who did not work for the entire calendar year from the considered population we then used statistical sampling to identify a group of associates who were paid within a range of above or below what we estimated to be our median gross earnings amount the median population we then reviewed recent historical taxable wage data of the median population and for those associates within the median population with stable wages we calculated each of their fiscal total compensation in the same way as we calculated our ceos fiscal total compensation as set forth in the summary compensation table of our proxy statement and identified the median

chairsarah j friarthomas w horton proxy statement table of contents shareholder proposals included in this proxy statement are two separate shareholder proposals that have been submitted under sec rules by shareholders who notified the company of their intention to present the proposals for voting at the annual shareholders meeting some shareholder proposals and supporting statements may contain assertions about walmart that we believe are incorrect and we have not tried to refute all such inaccuracies in the companys responses all statements and citations contained in a shareholder proposal and its supporting statements are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to walmart inc c o gordon y allison senior vice president office of the corporate secretary chief counsel for finance and corporate governance southwest th street bentonville arkansas the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals for the reasons stated in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal table of contents proposal no request to strengthen prevention of workplacesexual harassment resolved shareholders of walmart inc walmart urge the board of directors to strengthen walmarts prevention of workplace sexual harassment by formalizing the boards oversight responsibility aligning senior executive compensation incentives reviewing and if necessary overseeing revision of company policies and reporting to shareholders by december on actions taken omitting confidential and proprietary information whereas recently workplace sexual harassment has generated major attention from the media and policy makers and spurred significant public debate the high profile metoo social media hashtag and sexual harassment claims involving public figures like bill oreilly steve wynn les moonves and travis kalanick have highlighted the prevalence of harassment and its impact the proportion of americans who believe that sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious problem increased from percent in to percent in one hundred twenty five laws were introduced in in legislatures on the subject of sexual harassment in the legislature itself workplace sexual harassment can damage companies in several ways first it may harm corporate reputation which can alienate consumers a recent study in harvard business review found that a single sexual harassment claim makes a company seem less equitable and that sexual harassment more than financial misconduct is perceived as evidence of a problematic corporate culture additionally a company whose culture tolerates sexual harassment tends to have higher turnover and less productive employees according to sociologist heather mclaughlin percent of women whove been harassed leave their jobs within two years the center for american progress cap found that the retail industry had the second highest incidence of harassment claims in the private sector representing percent of all claims furthermore cap found that womenparticularly women of colorare more likely to work lower wage jobs like retail where power imbalances are often more pronounced and where fears of reprisals or losing their jobs can deter victims from coming forward sexual harassment allegations can also lead to declines in share value for example the market capitalization of wynn resorts dropped by billion over two days after allegations of sexual harassment against ceo steve wynn surfaced marketwatch robust board oversight is especially important at walmart following ongoing issues of sexual harassment at the company a well publicized article this year documented a female associates struggle to hold her manager accountable for inappropriately touching her similar complaints of harassment from employees taking inappropriate pictures to discrimination against transgender employees have been lodged as the largest corporate employer of women in the u s walmart can and should be a leader in establishing policies and protocols that enable women and men to reach their full potential at walmart while holding wrongdoers accountable we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal https

contents proposal no request to strengthen prevention of workplace sexual harassment walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board believes the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary in light of the companys policies and procedures and our corresponding associate training and education programs the risk oversight responsibility for legal and regulatory compliance that is already formalized in the charter of the audit committee and the fact that the companys incentive compensation plans include robust clawback provisions that reinforce the companys policies the companys policies prohibit sexual harassment and the companys training and education programs raise awareness about the policies and how to report concerns one of the basic beliefs upon which our company was founded is respect for the individual meaning every associate is responsible for creating a culture of trust and respect that promotes a positive work environment this means treating one another with fairness and courtesy in all of our interactions in the workplace our policy strictly prohibits discrimination or harassment by or directed at associates job applicants customers members suppliers or people working on walmarts behalf and we believe our policies are broader than the minimum required by law as part of the onboarding process our associates participate in training modules about our global statement of ethics which includes a discussion about our policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment in addition all managers and hourly supervisors are required to take a refresher training module on a regular basis our ongoing associate training as well as our global statement of ethics includes a component about how to report concerns if an associate experiences observes or otherwise becomes aware of any conduct that may violate our policies the associate can report his or her concerns to any salaried member of management using our open door process the associate may also report the issue confidentially or anonymously to our global ethics office via email or phone the company takes all allegations of inappropriate conduct seriously and we believe we have robust policies and practices in place regarding the investigation of harassment complaints of all types in addition to the training modules and refresher courses regarding our global statement of ethics we recently launched a number of additional education and awareness training programs designed to reinforce our non discrimination and harassment policies enhance awareness about preventing workplace sexual harassment and remind our associates how to report concerns risk oversight responsibility is already formalized in the audit committee charter the charter of the audit committee which is reviewed and approved by the audit committee and the full board on a regular basis already refers to the audit committees role and responsibility for oversight of risks related to legal and regulatory compliance as well as the global statement of ethics more specifically the audit committee charter states that the audit committee shall discuss with management and advise the board with respect to the companys policies processes and procedures regarding compliance with applicable laws regulations and our global statement of ethics and instances of non compliance therewith the risk oversight role of the audit committee has been described in our proxy materials for several years including this year on page the companys incentive compensation plans include clawback provisions for violations of company policies as described in this and previous proxy statements the companys incentive compensation plans support the companys efforts to enforce its policies for example the company has already disclosed that annual cash incentive payments to the companys senior executives may be reduced by up to if they violate the companys discrimination and harassment policies likewise the company has already disclosed that awards to senior executives under our incentive compensation plans may be subject to the relevant clawback provisions of the management incentive plan and the stock incentive plan if the senior executive violates company policies including our policies that prohibit workplace sexual harassment table of contents proposal no request to strengthen prevention of workplace sexual harassment summary walmart remains committed to being a great place to work in light of our current policies and programs and the audit committees risk oversight function which have already been described in our public disclosures as well as the clawback provisions in the companys incentive compensation plans the board believes the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary and would distract from the execution of other important and ongoing strategic initiatives against for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement table of contents proposal no request to adopt cumulative voting resolved that the stockholders of walmart assembled in annual meeting in person and by proxy hereby request the board of directors to take the necessary steps to provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors which means each stockholder shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of shares he or she owns multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and he or she may cast all of such votes for a single candidate or any two or more of them as he or she may see fit cumulative voting is recommended by the late benjamin graham in the book security analysis coauthored by david dodd cumulative voting gives shareholders improved distinction in electing directors some walmart stockholders believe raising concerns at public companies should be improved currently walmart written policy prohibits retaliation for those raising concerns this language appears similar in scope to retaliation and employment language used by general electric company general electric company promises strict confidentiality for those raising concerns in its spirit and letter general electric in writing also promises strict confidentiality in its arbitration agreement these written promises have given some employees including their reputable counsel cause to formally request relief when they believed these promises were breached see case cv jhm dw general electric using counsel obtained a summary judgement against this employee effectively removing the retaliation jurisdiction from an impartial jury or arbitrator procedures of retaliation against employees of the general electric company by the company appear similar to walmarts as no effective oversight outside the company performing the alleged retaliation exists general electric makes a mockery of its promises handling concerns raised after many promises of strict confidentiality so they appear on internet https www sec gov divisions corpfin cf noaction a martinharangozorecon a pdf this website contains an e mail dated november by matthew johnson who appears to count income for year for parts not sold that year and not projected to be sold until later in year general electric was fined and rebuked by the securities exchange commission for accounting fraud https www sec gov news press htm accounting appearing similar to that used by matthew johnson some general electric stockholders believe matthew johnson lied under oath walmart is confederate with general electric as it places general electric products on its store shelves general electric once a most valuable company lost most of that value all while the broad stock market gained in value this prosperity decline mirrors poor prosperity in environments using secrecy and oppression comparing per capita income of the united states to that of north korea illustrates this point increased stockholder voice as represented by cumulative voting may be critical in transparency and success table of contents proposal no request to adopt cumulative voting walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board recommends that shareholders voteagainstthis proposal because our current majority voting election process is a commonly accepted best practice that we believe promotes a more overall effective board of directors additionally our current corporate governance documents and practices already provide meaningful opportunities for shareholders to promote director accountability at walmart like many other companies each share is entitled to one vote for each director nominee in uncontested director elections like the one presented in this proxy statement walmart directors are elected by an affirmative majority of the votes cast in contested elections where there are more director nominees than there are director seats available our directors are elected by an affirmative plurality of the votes cast cumulative voting could result in the election of a director interested in representing only the special interests of a small group of shareholders rather than all our shareholders we believe the impacts of cumulative voting can weaken the ability of a board of directors to work together productively which is essential to the successful functioning of any board of directors therefore the consequences of cumulative voting could be detrimental to the effective functioning of the board the board supports our current majority voting standard which is widely considered a best practice and is widely and commonly applied among most sp companies and fortune companies in contrast according to factset only approximately of sp companies currently permit cumulative voting furthermore the board believes that our bylaws corporate governance guidelines and other governance practices already provide walmarts shareholders with the right tools to promote director accountability for example our bylaws include a market standard proxy access right that allows qualifying shareholders to submit director nominees for inclusion in our proxy materials all of our directors are elected annually shareholders have a right to call special shareholders meetings no supermajority voting requirement where appropriate our lead independent director can be available for consultation with major shareholders generally defined as those holding or more of the companys outstanding shares no poison pill provision in our bylaws summary the board believes that our current majority voting standard shareholder rights in our governance documents and our other corporate governance practices are fair and are more likely to result in an effective board of directors that represents all of our shareholders against for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement table of contents stock ownership equity compensation plan information the following table provides

gaap financial measures the non gaap measures and tell you briefly how we calculate them the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap or using only measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that we believe is most directly comparable to each non gaap measure each a comparable gaap measure the reasons why we think the non gaap measures provide our shareholders with useful information about our financial condition and results of operations and a reconciliation of each non gaap measure with its comparable gaap measure when we refer below to a financial measure as being a reported financial measure we are referring to a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and reflected in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal adjusted eps our diluted earnings per share attributable to walmart which we refer to as eps is calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and is based on our consolidated net income attributable to walmart as reflected in our consolidated statement of income non gaap measure the companys adjusted eps which we refer to as adjusted eps for fiscal was calculated by adjusting the eps for fiscal by the amount of the per share net impact on our eps for fiscal of the loss on the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil unrealized gains and losses on the companys investment in jd com and the adjustments we recorded to the provisional amount we had recorded in a prior period for the u s tax reform under the tax cut and jobs act of tax reform comparable gaap measure the companys reported eps for fiscal why the non gaap measure is useful information management believes that the adjusted eps for fiscal which adjusts eps for the items described above is a meaningful metric to share with shareholders because that metric which adjusts our eps for fiscal for the items described above affords investors a view of what management considers the companys core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance and to compare core earnings performance for fiscal with our earnings performance for prior comparable periods a table of contents annex a reconciliation reconciliation of the companys eps for fiscal to the companys adjusted eps for fiscal adjusted eps fiscal fiscal year ended

translating into u s dollars the net sales of the countries in which the functional currency is not the u s dollar or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in

company sales for fiscal over total company sales for fiscal in each case calculated and presented in accordance with gaap why the non gaap measure is useful information management believes that the percentage growth in total company sales on a constant currency basis for fiscal over fiscal calculated and presented in accordance with gaap allows shareholders to better understand walmarts underlying year over year sales growth without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations reconciliation reconciliation of the percentage increase in our consolidated net sales for fiscal as

measures or why we believe those non gaap financial measures are important information for our shareholders to have or provide a reconciliation of each of those non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap however we believe it is important for our shareholders to understand how we calculated the non gaap measures described above we calculated adjusted constant currency total company operating income for incentive plan purposes by translating the as reported operating income for fiscal of the countries in which the functional currency is not the u s dollar or countries experiencing hyperinflation by using the currency exchange rates we had used to translate our fiscal operating income in those countries into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes rather than by using the current periods currency exchange rates to make that translation and adjusting such operating income by excluding the excluded

fiscal operating income in those countries into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes rather than by using the current periods currency exchange rates to make that translation and adjusting such operating income by excluding the excluded items we calculated constant currency total company sales for incentive plan purposes by adding our walmart u s net sales and sams club net sales to the constant currency net sales of our walmart international segment in each case for fiscal and adjusting the total of those net sales by excluding the excluded items we calculated constant currency walmart international net sales by translating the net sales for fiscal of those countries within our walmart international segment in which the functional currency is not the u s dollar or countries

the current periods currency exchange rates to make that translation and adjusting such net sales by excluding the excluded items a table of contents annex a we calculated our adjusted roi for fiscal as our operating income for fiscal plus our interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for fiscal divided by average invested capital for fiscal we considered average invested capital for fiscal to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets for fiscal plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for fiscal plus a rent factor equal to rent expense for fiscal multiplied by a factor of eight in computing the adjusted operating income component of roi we adjusted by excluding from such components the excluded items we also made certain minor adjustments to our average invested capital as described under executive compensationcompensation discussion and analysis elsewhere in this proxy statement although return on investment is a standard financial measure our calculation of roi may differ from other companies calculations of their return on investment we calculated the adjusted operating income and the sales excluding certain items of each of our walmart u s segment and our sams club segment by excluding the excluded items we calculated fiscal total
