written materials required to be submitted pursuant to rule a g ctw investment group may dear wal mart inc shareholder we wish the recent critiques of wal mart s pay practices and the recommendations against this year s advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation would have prompted the board to reflect on whether it is properly aligning executive pay to company performance instead the board has chosen to respond with a defense of its practices that upon examination fails to provide any new or exculpatory information the board argues that its pay is closely aligned with performance but cannot rebut the finding that over the past three years wal mart s target ceo pay has ranked at the nd percentile of its equilar peer group while its total shareholder return ranks at the nd percentile the board asserts incorrectly that institutional shareholder services acknowledges that wal mart s ceo pay is low relative to the median of its peers in fact current ceo mcmillon s million in total compensation for fy is times the median for the peer group selected by wal mart and about times the iss selected peer group the board argues that its short term and long term performance payouts were below the targeted payouts for executives this year but as we have noted these payouts are large in absolute terms and relative to salary former ceo duke received an annual cash incentive payout of million more than twice his salary current ceo mcmillon received a bonus of over million over of his salary disproportionate to performance in that they provide a much larger percentage of the targeted award than the percentage of targeted performance achieved mr duke s cash incentive payout represented of his targeted bonus despite the company achieving only of targeted performance mr mcmillon received a bonus equal to of its targeted level despite achievement of only and of the two targeted performance metrics significantly larger than if the performance measures were calculated in gaap terms rather than with multiple adjustments for fy the sole metric for mr duke s bonus total company operating income fell measured in gaap terms but increased with the board approved adjustments mr mcmillon s targeted performance included one other measure international operating income which fell in gaap terms but rose as adjusted by the board the board acknowledges that it has persistently lowered the targets and thresholds for the return on investment metric used in its performance shares plan nevertheless it insists that this repeated shifting of the goal posts does not mean that the goals it sets for executives are not demanding the board seems to believe that the point of such programs is to ensure that executives enjoy a handsome payout regardless of performance we disagree we believe that steadily declining roi indicates a challenge and that the board should incentivize executives to rise to this challenge if instead executives can expect performance goals to be lowered year after year we worry that wal mart s long standing decline in roi will not be reversed the board suggests that the billion increase in the company s market capitalization over the past five fiscal years indicates that shareholders believe in our strategies however as the company s own k reveals wal mart s share price growth over the last five fiscal years has significantly lagged both the s p retail index and the s p overall the board argues that the adjustments it makes to various performance measures are appropriate in order to avoid disincentivizing sound long term decisions that have negative consequences for short term performance however in our view this potential conflict between the short and long term is precisely why companies have multiple components to their executive compensation programs so that executives can be confident that difficult short term decisions will be rewarded in the long run consequently adjustments to performance measures that reflect decisions over which executives have significant control should be unnecessary moreover while the net effect of these l street nw suite washington dc www ctwinvestment group com adjustments is not always to improve on gaap measured performance they did have this performance boosting effect in five of the last seven fiscal years including the past two years for total company operating income growth and international operating income growth for us operating income growth the adjusted performance is higher than gaap performance for each of the past six fiscal years the board provides no defense for adjusting its sales measure for its performance shares program to reflect reductions in federal snap benefits which we assume indicates that the board realizes such adjustments are indefensible the board fails altogether to justify its additional grants of between million and million in restricted stock to executives for retention purposes despite these executives having already received between million and million in restricted stock grants over the past three years we note that according to wal mart s proxy statement pg termination of an executive s employment for reasons other than death or disability would result in the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock so these large recent grants seem to provide a more than adequate retention incentive moreover one of these executives was only hired in and another promoted to her current position in making it hard to understand why the recent ceo transition would require a special equity grant to retain their services we believe that a creative evidenced based approach to human capital management including but not limited to the level and design of executive compensation is both consistent with the compensation nominating and governance committee s charter and in the best interests of long term shareholders we hope that the board will reconsider its response and make appropriate changes to its executive pay program in the near future until then for all of the reasons listed above we urge you to vote against proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation at wal mart inc s annual meeting on june sincerely s dieter waizenegger executive director ctw investment group this is not a solicitation of authority to vote
