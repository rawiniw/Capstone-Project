laws other regulatory changes overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our walmart u s segment and sams

to our expansion in the united states including conversions of discount stores into supercenters which may adversely affect our financial performance our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the united states and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations our ability to open additional supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets and sams clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states increased real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters if we are unable to open new supercenters discount stores neighborhood markets or sams clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters our financial performance such as net sales and operating income growth could be adversely affected in addition if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market our financial performance could be adversely affected impediments to the expansion of our international operations could adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy for our international segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing international business as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations in the countries in which we have existing operations new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats such as supercenters or sams clubs not previously operated in those markets as in the united states our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our international segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units in addition access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets moreover cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve if we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our international segment our financial performance could be adversely affected we may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our international segment and our future financial performance failure to attract and retain qualified associates changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance our ability to continue to expand our operations in the united states and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates our ability to meet our labor needs including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores clubs and distribution centers while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs is generally subject to numerous external factors including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located unemployment levels within those markets prevailing wage rates changing demographics health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations if we are unable to locate to attract or to retain qualified personnel if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws rules or regulations are adopted our financial performance could be affected adversely we face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could adversely affect our financial performance the retail business is highly competitive each of our business segments competes for customers employees store sites products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local regional and national retailers both in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we have operations our walmart u s segment competes with retailers operating discount department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores and hypermarts as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses our sams club segment competes with other wholesale club operators as well as discount retailers retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors as well as internet based retailers wholesalers and catalog businesses internationally we compete with retailers who operate department drug variety and specialty stores supermarkets supercenter type stores hypermarts wholesale clubs internet based retailers and catalog businesses such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways including merchandise selection and availability services offered to customers location store hours in store amenities and price our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs including edlp rollbacks and store of the community have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our edlp philosophy we will lower our prices on goods for sale our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance see item business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources improved access to merchandise greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies which could adversely affect our financial performance risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance all of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws including labor and environmental laws and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards labor problems experienced by our suppliers the availability of raw materials to suppliers merchandise quality issues currency exchange rates transport availability and cost transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control in addition the united states foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance our customers count on us to provide them with safe products concerns regarding the safety of food and non food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non food needs even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish as such any issue regarding the safety of any food and non food items we sell regardless of the cause could adversely affect our financial performance our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our financial performance we currently conduct operations in argentina brazil canada chile costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras japan mexico nicaragua puerto rico and the united kingdom as well as through joint venture agreements in china and india and our other controlled subsidiaries in china during fiscal our international operations generated of our net sales as a result of our expansion activities in foreign countries we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors most of which are beyond our control these factors include political conditions including political instability economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints trade policies both of the united states and of the other countries in which we operate currency regulations and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate now or in the future foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations and could adversely affect our financial performance moreover the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations which if they occurred again could adversely affect our financial performance other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade monetary and fiscal policies both of the united states and of other countries laws regulations and other activities of foreign governments agencies and similar organizations and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the united states additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the united states the various risks inherent in doing business in the united states generally also exist when doing business outside of the united states and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations natural disasters and geo political events could adversely affect our financial performance the occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as hurricanes floods and earthquakes other weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise such as major winter storms droughts and tornados and geo political events such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks both internationally and domestically could adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties the closure of one or more stores clubs and distribution centers the lack of an adequate work force in a market the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating the reduction in the availability of products in our stores the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities and disruption in our communications with our stores these factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance the significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others the insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms such as hurricanes and tropical storms was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage previously available to us as a result the company has chosen to be primarily self insured for losses that may result from named windstorms we are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are involved in a number of legal proceedings which include consumer employment tort and other litigation certain of these lawsuits if decided adversely to us or settled by us may result in liability material to our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws in addition we are a defendant in dukes v wal mart stores inc a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the united states the class as certified in dukes currently includes present and former female associates the plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions pay training and job assignments and seek among other things injunctive relief front pay back pay punitive damages and attorneys fees on june the u s district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification which we have appealed on february a divided three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit upheld the district courts ruling on february the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court of appeals on november the three judge panel withdrew its opinion of february and issued a revised opinion as a result the companys petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january on february the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition the court of appeals heard oral argument on the petition on march we discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption item legal proceedings and in note to our consolidated financial statements which are part of our annual report to shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k and are included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k if we do not maintain the security of customer related information we could damage our reputation with customers incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation as do most retailers we receive certain personal information about our customers in addition our online operations at www walmart com and www samsclub com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks including information permitting cashless payments a compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others as well as our operations results of operations financial condition and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties in addition a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations particularly our online sales operations we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions summarize results and manage our business disruptions in both our primary and secondary back up systems could harm our ability to run our business implementation of a new financial system in fiscal year if not properly completed could make financial information unavailable on a timely basis and delay our financial reporting although we have independent redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems our computer systems including our back up systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees if our computer systems and our back up systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations in addition we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems which will include for many of our computer systems establishing common processes across our lines of business the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk if we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to implement a new financial system in our u s canada and puerto rico operations the implementation of this new financial system relates to the largest portion of our business and will be a significant component of our internal controls over financial reporting if the new financial system does not function properly upon implementation we may be unable to produce information as needed to manage our business most efficiently or to accumulate and report financial information on a timely basis we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers the demand for our products and services and our market share item b unresolved staff comments not applicable item properties the number of

fiscal and fiscal comparable sales includes all stores and clubs that have been open for at least the previous months additionally for those fiscal years stores and clubs that are relocated expanded or converted are excluded from comparable sales for the first months following the relocation expansion or conversion fiscal and comparable sales included sales from stores and clubs open for the

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview wal mart stores inc walmart the company or we operates retail stores in various formats around the world and is committed to saving people money so they can live better we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at every day low prices edlp while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect integrity and diversity edlp is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so that our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity our focus for sams club is to provide exceptional value on brand name merchandise at members only prices for both business and personal use internationally we operate with similar philosophies our fiscal year ends on january for our u s canada and puerto rico operations our fiscal year ends on december for all other operations we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess our performance the discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of january and the year then ended and accompanying notes our operations comprise three business segments walmart u s international and sams club the walmart u s segment includes the companys mass merchant concept in the united states operating under the walmart or wal mart brand as well as walmart com the international segment consists of the companys operations outside of the united states the sams club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the united states as well as samsclub com throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income and comparable store sales the company measures the results of its segments using among other measures each segments operating income which includes certain corporate overhead allocations from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income including any corporate overhead allocations as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revisions is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability in connection with the companys finance transformation project we reviewed and adjusted the classification of certain revenue and expense items within our consolidated statements of income for financial reporting purposes the reclassifications did not impact operating income or consolidated net income attributable to walmart the changes were effective february and have been reflected in all periods presented comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year in fiscal our method of calculating comparable store sales included all stores and clubs that were open for at least the previous months additionally stores and clubs that were relocated expanded or converted were excluded from comparable store sales for the first months following the relocation expansion or conversion during fiscal year the company reviewed its definition of comparable store sales for consistency with other retailers as a result of that review since february walmarts definition of comparable store sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations and expansions changes in format continue to be excluded from comparable store sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in square footage of more than five percent since the impact of this revision is inconsequential the company will not restate comparable store sales results for previously reported years comparable store sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussions of our consolidated results and the operating results of our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segments operating results from local currencies into u s dollars for reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not u s denominated the retail industry we operate in the highly competitive retail industry in both the united states and the countries we serve internationally we face strong sales competition from other discount department drug variety and specialty stores warehouse clubs and supermarkets many of which are national regional or international chains as well as internet based retailers and catalog businesses we compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees whom we call associates we along with other retail companies are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions cost of goods consumer disposable income consumer debt levels and buying patterns consumer credit availability interest rates customer preferences unemployment labor costs inflation deflation currency exchange fluctuations fuel and energy prices weather patterns climate change catastrophic events competitive pressures and insurance costs further information on risks to our company can be located in item a risk factors in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the companys priority of growth focuses on sales growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys metric to increase our operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing our operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of our net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs our assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company manages working capital through free cash flow growth net sales fiscal years ended january dollar amounts in millions net sales percentof total percentincrease net sales percentof total percentincrease net sales percentof total walmart u s international sams club net sales our net sales increased by and in fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year net sales in fiscal increased due to increased customer traffic continued global expansion activities and the acquisition of our chilean subsidiary distribucin y servicio ds in january offset primarily by a billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact in our international segment and price deflation in certain merchandise categories in our walmart u s segment net sales in fiscal increased due to our global expansion activities and comparable store sales increases offset by a billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact despite the unfavorable impact of currency exchanges rates the international segments net sales as a percentage of total company net sales increased in fiscal and respectively volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the international segments net sales in the future comparable store sales fiscalyearsendedjanuary walmart u s sams club total u s sams club comparable club sales include fuel fuel sales had a negative impact of percentage points in fiscal year and positive impact of and percentage points in fiscal years and respectively on comparable club sales comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year comparable store sales in the united states decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal although customer traffic increased in fiscal comparable store sales in the united states were lower than fiscal due to deflation in certain merchandise categories and lower fuel prices comparable store sales in the united states in fiscal were higher than fiscal due to an increase in customer traffic as well as an increase in average transaction size per customer as we continue to add new stores in the united states we do so with an understanding that additional stores may take sales away from existing units we estimate the negative impact on comparable store sales as a result of opening new stores was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal with our planned slower new store growth we expect the impact of new stores on comparable store sales to stabilize over time leverage fiscal years ended january dollar amounts in millions operatingincome percentof total percentincrease operatingincome percentoftotal percentincrease operatingincome percentof total walmart u s international sams club other total operating income we believe growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales growth is a meaningful measure because it indicates how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales operating expenses in fiscal operating expenses increased when compared to fiscal while net sales increased over the same period operating expenses grew at a faster rate than net sales due to higher health benefit costs restructuring charges and higher advertising expenses in fiscal operating expenses increased compared to fiscal while net sales increased over the same period operating expenses grew at a faster rate than net sales in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs legal matters higher health benefit costs and increased corporate expenses operating income for fiscal we met our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales our operating income increased by when compared to fiscal while net sales increased by over the same period our walmart u s and international segments met this objective our sams club segment fell short of this objective primarily due to a million charge to restructure its operations including the closure of clubs for fiscal we did not meet our objective because our operating income increased by when compared to fiscal while net sales increased by over the same period the walmart u s and sams club segments fell short of this objective due to increases in operating expenses the international segment fell short of this objective due to accruals for certain legal matters and fluctuations in currency exchange rates returns return on investment management believes return on investment is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percent for both fiscal years ended january and we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows for the years endedjanuary dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of january certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of closing stores and the divesture of other properties of the seiyu ltd now walmart japan pursuant to a restructuring program adopted during the third quarter of fiscal all of these activities have been disclosed as discontinued operations total assets as of january and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated positive free cash flow of billion billion and billion for the years ended january and respectively the increase in our free cash flow is primarily the result of improved operating results and inventory management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities fiscal years ended january amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our continuing operations and excludes any results or discussion of our discontinued operations unusual or infrequent items that impacted our income from continuing operations during the fiscal years ended and were as follows in fiscal the company announced several organizational changes including the closure of sams clubs designed to strengthen and streamline our operations as a result we recorded million in pre tax restructuring charges in fiscal we recorded million in net tax benefits primarily from the repatriation of certain non u s earnings that increased u s foreign tax credits in fiscal the company settled wage and hour class action lawsuits as a result of the settlement the company recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal we reduced our accrued liabilities for our

in january offset primarily by a billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact in our international segment and price deflation in certain merchandise categories in our walmart u s segment net sales in fiscal increased due to our global store expansion activities comparable store sales increases offset by a billion unfavorable currency exchange rate impact volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the international segments net sales in the future our gross profit as a percentage of net sales our gross profit margin was and in fiscal and respectively our walmart u s and international segment sales yield higher gross profit margins than our sams club segment in fiscal gross profit margin increased primarily due to the continued focus on enhanced merchandising strategies and better inventory management in our walmart u s and sams club segments the gross profit margin increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower inventory shrinkage and less markdown activity as a result of more effective merchandising in the walmart u s segment operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were and for fiscal and respectively in fiscal operating expenses increased primarily due to higher health benefit costs a pre tax charge of million relating to the restructuring of u s operations and higher advertising expenses in fiscal operating expenses increased primarily due to higher utility costs a pre tax charge of approximately million resulting from the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits higher health benefit costs and increased corporate expenses compared to fiscal our effective income tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal years and the fiscal effective tax rate decreased compared to fiscal due to million in net tax

the fiscal net sales increase comparable store sales were lower in fiscal despite increased customer traffic due to a decrease in average transaction size per customer driven by price deflation in

profit margin increased percentage points compared to the prior year due to more effective merchandising better inventory management and lower inventory shrinkage in fiscal gross profit margin

fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities supply us with a significant source of liquidity we use these cash flows supplemented with long term debt and short

ended january amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash flow provided by operating activities was billion billion and billion for the years ended january and respectively the increases in cash flows provided by operating activities for each fiscal year were primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations and improved working capital management working capital current liabilities exceeded current assets at january by billion an increase of million from january our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at january and we generally have a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payment of dividends capital resources during fiscal we issued billion of long term debt the net proceeds from the issuance of such long term debt were used for general corporate purposes during fiscal we issued billion of long term debt those net proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes management believes that cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining long term financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the recent past the following table details the ratings of the credit rating agencies that rated our outstanding indebtedness at january the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of

one year obligations under capital leases due in one year long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases total capitalization is defined as debt plus total walmart shareholders equity our ratio of debt to our total capitalization decreased in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in short term borrowings global expansion activities cash paid for property and equipment was billion billion and billion during the fiscal years ended january and respectively these expenditures primarily relate to new store growth as well as remodeling costs for existing stores we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion in fiscal we plan to finance this expansion and any acquisitions of other operations that we may make during fiscal primarily out of cash flows from operations fiscal capital expenditures will include the addition of the following new relocated and expanded units in the u s fiscalyear projectedunitgrowth walmart u s segment sams club segment

replaced share repurchase program the new program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased billion of our shares under the program or we terminate or replace the program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued status we spent billion billion and billion in share repurchases during fiscal year and respectively we consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things our current cash needs our capacity for leverage our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock as of january the program had approximately billion remaining authorization for share repurchases contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments such as debt

additionally the company has approximately billion in undrawn lines of credit and standby letters of credit which if drawn upon would be included in the liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets purchase obligations include legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases as well as commitments to make capital expenditures software acquisition license commitments and legally binding service contracts purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other services are not included in the table above purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty the expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid with respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations in addition to the amounts shown in the table above billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities the timing of the payment associated with these liabilities is uncertain refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed and presented above the company has made certain guarantees as discussed below for which the timing of payment if any is unknown in connection with certain debt financing we could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur at january the aggregate termination payment would have been million the two arrangements pursuant to which these payments could be made will expire in fiscal and fiscal in connection with the development of our grocery distribution network in the united states we have agreements with third parties which would require us to purchase or assume the leases on certain unique equipment in the event the agreements are terminated these agreements which can be terminated by either party at will cover up to a five year period and obligate the company to pay up to approximately million upon termination of some or all of these agreements the company has potential future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately future locations these lease commitments have lease terms ranging from to years and provide for certain minimum rentals if executed payments under operating leases would increase by million for fiscal based on current cost estimates market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks including changes in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates the analysis presented for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a change in interest or currency exchange rates these changes are hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential risk and do not represent our view of future market changes as the hypothetical figures discussed below indicate changes in fair value based on the assumed change in rates generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other assumption in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities at january and we had billion and billion respectively of long term debt outstanding our weighted average effective interest rate on long term debt after considering the effect of interest rate swaps was and at january and respectively a hypothetical increase in interest rates in effect at january and would have increased annual interest expense on borrowings outstanding at those dates by million and million respectively at january and we had million and billion respectively of outstanding commercial paper and short term borrowing obligations the weighted average interest rate including fees on these obligations at january and was and respectively a hypothetical increase in these rates in effect at january and would have increased the annual interest expense for the respective outstanding balances by million we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt our preference is to maintain between and of our debt portfolio including interest rate swaps in floating rate debt the swap agreements are contracts to exchange fixed or variable rates for variable or fixed interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instruments the aggregate fair value of these swaps represented a gain of million and million at january and respectively a hypothetical increase or decrease of in interest rates from the level in effect at january would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of million and million respectively a hypothetical increase or decrease of in interest rates from the level in effect at january would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of million we hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments in the united kingdom in fiscal we entered into currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non u s denominated debt the aggregate fair value of these swaps at january and represented a gain of million and million respectively a hypothetical increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of million and million at january and january respectively a hypothetical change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at january would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of million and million respectively on the value of the swaps in addition to currency swaps we have designated debt of approximately billion as of january and as a hedge of our net investment in the united kingdom at january a hypothetical increase or decrease in value of the u s dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of million at january a hypothetical increase or decrease in value of the u s dollar relative to the british pound would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value

of the u s dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of million at january a hypothetical increase or decrease in value of the u s dollar relative to the japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of million summary of critical accounting policies management strives to report the financial results of the company in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology in preparing our consolidated financial statements we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements these judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes actual results may differ from our estimates management continually reviews its accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all our walmart u s segments merchandise sams club merchandise and merchandise in our distribution warehouses are valued based on weighted average cost using the lifo method inventories for international operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in first out fifo method under the retail method inventory is stated at cost which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise groupings retail value the fifo cost to retail ratio is based on the initial margin of beginning inventory plus the fiscal year purchase activity the cost to retail ratio for measuring any lifo reserves is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any markdowns the retail method requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the amount of gross profit recognized judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell through inventory and shrinkage when management determines the salability of inventory has diminished markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand customer preferences and age of merchandise as well as seasonal and fashion trends changes in weather patterns and customer preferences related to fashion trends could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year when necessary the company records a lifo provision for a quarter for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally generated retail price indices at january and our inventories valued at lifo approximated those inventories as if they were valued at fifo the company provides for estimated inventory losses shrinkage between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales the provision is adjusted annually to reflect the historical trend of the actual physical inventory count results impairment of assets we evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable managements judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and our operational performance such as operating income and cash flows the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally at the individual store level or in certain circumstances at the market group level the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period these factors could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and require that impairment tests be performed which could result in management determining that the value of long lived assets is impaired resulting in a write down of the long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired this evaluation requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions these evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative market based approach historically the company has generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible assets because of the nature of the factors used in these tests if different conditions occur in future periods future operating results could be materially impacted income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge if any from taxing authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate we account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements this determination requires the use of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items self insurance we use a combination of insurance self insured retention and self insurance for a number of risks including but not limited to workers compensation general liability vehicle liability and the companys obligation for employee related health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated by considering historical claims experience including frequency severity demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions in calculating our liability we analyze our historical trends including loss development and apply appropriate loss development factors to the incurred costs associated with the claims made against our self insured program the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss development differ from these assumptions for example for our workers compensation and general liability accrual a increase or decrease to the assumptions for claims costs or loss development factors would increase or decrease our self insurance accrual by million in fiscal our actuarially determined ultimate loss estimates were reduced primarily for our fiscal through workers compensation and general liability claims the reductions in ultimate loss estimates resulted primarily from improved claims handling experience which impacts loss development factors and other actuarial assumptions due to the beneficial change in estimate of our ultimate losses accrued liabilities for general liability and workers compensation claims were reduced by million or million after tax resulting in an increase in net income per basic and diluted common share of for the second quarter of fiscal

settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop our own assumptions the disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at cost are as follows cash and cash equivalents the carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments long term

instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty when appropriate the companys transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held cash collateral from these counterparties of million and million at january and respectively it is our policy to record cash collateral exclusive of any derivative asset and any collateral holdings are reflected in our accrued liabilities as amounts due to the counterparties furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral if the derivative liability position exceeds million the company has no outstanding collateral postings and in the event of providing cash collateral the company would record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rates the contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change fair value instruments the company is party to receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating rate interest and receives fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the instruments the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the instruments being hedged the derivative instruments were assumed to be perfectly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the hedges were recorded in long term debt and accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with no net impact on the income statement these fair value instruments will mature on various dates ranging from february to may net investment instruments at january and the company is party to cross currency interest rate swaps that hedge its net investment in the united kingdom the agreements are contracts to

associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non u s denominated debt the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non u s

the company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts however if any portion were to be distributed the related u s tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation net operating losses tax credit carryforwards and valuation allowances at january the company had international net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately billion of these carryforwards approximately billion will expire if not utilized in various years through the remaining carryforwards have no expiration at january the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of billion which

the company recorded accrued interest of million and million respectively accrued penalties totaled million at january and there were no changes to accrued penalties during the year during the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between million and million either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance the company does not expect any change to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position at january and the company had an unrecognized tax benefit of billion which is related to an ordinary worthless stock deduction from the fiscal disposition of its german operations of this million was recognized in discontinued

enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the companys shareholders the matters or groups of related matters discussed below if decided adversely to or settled by the company individually or in the aggregate may result in liability material to the companys financial condition or results of operations wage and hour class actions the company is a defendant in various cases containing class action allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly associates who allege that the company committed wage and hour violations by failing to provide rest breaks meal periods or other benefits or otherwise by failing to pay them correctly the complaints generally seek unspecified monetary damages injunctive relief or both the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these lawsuits except where the lawsuit has been settled or otherwise as noted below in one of the wage and hour lawsuits braun hummel v wal mart stores inc a trial was commenced in september in philadelphia pennsylvania the plaintiffs allege that the company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented class members from taking their full meal and rest breaks on october the jury awarded back pay damages to the plaintiffs of

factual and legal defenses to the claims at issue and on december the company filed its notice of appeal exempt status cases the company is a defendant in several cases in which the plaintiffs seek class or collective certification of various groups of salaried managers and challenge their exempt status under state and federal laws in one of those cases sepulveda v wal mart stores inc class certification was denied by the trial court on may on april a three judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the trial courts ruling in part and reversed it in part and remanded the case for further proceedings on may the company filed a petition seeking review of that ruling by a larger panel of the court on october the court entered an order staying all proceedings in the sepulveda appeal pending the final disposition of the appeal in dukes v wal mart stores inc discussed below class certification has not been addressed in the other cases the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these lawsuits gender discrimination cases the company is a defendant in dukes v wal mart stores inc a class action lawsuit commenced in june in the united states district court for the northern district of california the case was brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of the companys

to certain exceptions includes all women employed at any wal mart domestic retail store at any time since december who have been or may be subjected to the pay and management track promotions policies and practices challenged by the plaintiffs the company believes that the district courts ruling is incorrect on august the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit granted the companys petition for discretionary review of the ruling on february a divided three judge panel of the court of appeals issued a decision affirming the district courts certification order on february the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the court on december the three judge panel withdrew its opinion of february and issued a revised opinion as a result the companys petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january on february the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition the court heard oral argument on the petition on march if the company is not successful in its appeal of class certification or an appellate court issues a ruling that allows for the certification of a class or classes with a different size or scope and if there is a subsequent adverse verdict on the merits from which there is no successful appeal or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the litigation the resulting liability could be material to the companys financial condition or results of operations the plaintiffs also seek punitive damages which if awarded could result in the payment of additional amounts material to the companys financial condition or results of operations however because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the appeal from the district courts certification decision because of the uncertainty of the balance of the proceedings contemplated by the district court and because the companys liability if any arising from the litigation including the size of any damages award if plaintiffs are successful in the litigation or any negotiated settlement could vary widely the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from the litigation since august the company has been a defendant in a lawsuit that was filed by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on august in the united states

transportation statute this u s attorneys office contends among other things that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because those materials may be considered hazardous waste the government alleges that to comply with rcra the company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier the company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent

existing accounting policies to comply with new accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb or the sec the following subcaptions provide a discussion of the companys adoption of new accounting policies as required by new accounting standards that became effective february or will become effective in future periods accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all consolidated acquisitions and business combinations using the purchase method of accounting as a result of new accounting standards effective february the company changed some of its accounting for business combinations on february therefore certain accounting policies differ when accounting for acquisitions occurring before and after february as discussed below the company applied the following policies in accounting for business combinations that occurred prior to february acquisition costs were included as part of the purchase price purchase accounting was applied to only the companys proportionate share in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a partial acquisition less than control was acquired goodwill was recorded only to the extent of the companys proportionate share in a partial acquired entity contingent consideration if any is recorded as additional purchase price when settled adjustments to income tax valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions are recognized as adjustments to the accounting for the business combination and contingent liabilities acquired were recorded at acquisition if probable and reasonably estimable subsequent to february the company applies the following policies in accounting for business combinations when applicable costs related to an acquisition are expensed as incurred regardless of the level of ownership acquired the company records the full fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired as part of the purchase price allocation goodwill includes any noncontrolling interest portion and is recorded as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the total fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired and any noncontrolling interest contingent consideration if any is included at fair value as part of initial purchase price adjustments to income tax valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions after the acquisition date are generally recognized as income tax expense and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value if fair value is not determinable a reasonably estimable amount is recorded provided the incurrence of the liability is probable no acquisitions have occurred subsequent to february however if any adjustments to income tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that relate to acquisitions prior to february occur within a one year period from the acquisition date due to revised facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date then the adjustment will be recorded to goodwill adjustments outside the one year measurement period are typically recorded to income tax expense noncontrolling interests effective february the company generally reports noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in the equity section of the companys balance sheet rather than in a mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and equity consolidated net income is also reduced by the amount attributable to the noncontrolling interest to arrive at net income attributable to walmart accordingly the changes have been retroactively applied in the companys consolidated financial statements furthermore when the company acquires some or all of the noncontrolling interest the transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction and any amount paid in excess of the noncontrolling interests cost basis acquired is recorded to additional paid in capital all noncontrolling interests where the company may be required to repurchase a portion of the noncontrolling interest under a put option or other contractual redemption requirement are presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and equity as redeemable noncontrolling interest future accounting policy adoptions a new accounting standard effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period changes the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie and requires companies to more frequently assess whether they must consolidate vies the company adopted this new standard on february we do
