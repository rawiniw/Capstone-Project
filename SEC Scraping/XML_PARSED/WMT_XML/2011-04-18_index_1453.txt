interest as well as material provided by management related to transactions relationships or arrangements between the company and the directors or parties related to the directors the board made its

leadership structure we have separated the roles of the chairman and the ceo of our company since we separate these roles in recognition of the differences between the two roles and the value to our company of having the distinct and different perspectives and experiences of a separate chairman and ceo as specified in our bylaws our ceo is responsible for the general management supervision and control of the business and affairs of our company and ensuring that all orders and resolutions of the board are carried into effect our chairman on the other hand is charged with presiding over all meetings of the board and our shareholders and providing advice and counsel to the ceo and our companys other officers regarding our business and operations by separating the roles of ceo and chairman our ceo is able to focus his time and energy on managing walmarts complex daily operations while our chairman can devote his time and attention to addressing matters relating to the responsibilities of our board our ceo and chairman have an excellent working relationship and with over years of experience with walmart our chairman is well positioned to provide our ceo with guidance advice and counsel regarding our companys business operations and strategy moreover we believe that having a separate chairman focused on oversight and governance matters allows the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role described below in connection with the boards annual self evaluation process as required by our corporate governance guidelines the board evaluates its organization and processes to ensure that the board is functioning effectively for the foregoing reasons we believe that our separate ceo chairman structure is the most appropriate and effective leadership structure for our company and our shareholders the boards role in risk oversight the audit committee reviews and discusses with management the companys processes and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management including the companys enterprise wide risk management program in addition the companys risk oversight process involves the board receiving information from management on a variety of matters including operations legal regulatory finance reputation and strategy as well as information regarding any material risks associated with each matter the full board or the appropriate board committee if the board committee is responsible for the oversight of the matter receives this information through updates from the appropriate members of management to enable it to understand monitor and give direction with respect to the companys risk management practices in addition when a board committee receives an update the chairperson of the relevant board committee reports on the discussion to the full board during the board committee reports portion of the next board meeting this enables the board and the board committees to coordinate the risk oversight role presiding

shares as to which they hold proxies in their discretion executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis executive summary in the following pages we discuss how our ceo cfo and certain other executive officers our named executive officers or neos were compensated in fiscal february through january and describe how this compensation fits within our executive compensation philosophy our financial performance for fiscal was mixed while our earnings performance exceeded our original guidance provided at the beginning of fiscal when our incentive goals were set the sales performance of our walmart us division was disappointing we continued to experience stable pre tax returns with return on investment roi for fiscal slightly less than the prior fiscal year our stock price increased moderately during fiscal and we returned approximately billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends the key financial measures on which our incentive compensation plans are based are operating income sales and roi despite our strong earnings performance and stable returns in fiscal our overall fiscal performance was slightly below our target performance goals under our cash incentive plan and below our target performance goals under our long term equity incentive program this performance impacted our neos compensation under our incentive plans for fiscal in particular our ceo earned a cash incentive payment that was slightly below target for fiscal and approximately percent less than his cash incentive payment for the prior year similarly during fiscal we fell short of our target performance goals under our long term performance share plan resulting in a reduction of our ceos long term equity incentive payout for fiscal and for future years our compensation program emphasizes performance our total direct compensation tdc packages for neos comprising base salary annual cash incentives and long term equity are heavily weighted towards performance base salary represents less than percent of each neos target tdc opportunity less than percent for the ceo and a substantial majority at least percent of each neos target tdc opportunity is contingent on meeting operating income sales and return on investment goals that we believe have a meaningful impact on shareholder value our neos annual cash incentive is based primarily on the operating income of our company and or one or more operating divisions depending on each neos responsibilities with the exception of the president and ceo of our walmart us division whose cash incentive for fiscal was based on a combination of operating income and sales our long term performance share program is based on total company roi and the sales performance of one or more operating divisions depending on each neos area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and the balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating divisions drives financial performance and shareholder value and mitigates the risk that our executives will overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of our company as a whole table of contents in addition our executive compensation program seeks to balance long term and annual performance our annual cash incentive plan is primarily based on operating income during a single fiscal year while our long term performance share plan is based on sales and roi over a three year period our executives also receive service based restricted stock which typically vests over three to five years after the grant date along with performance shares restricted stock gives our neos ownership in the company as well as serving as a retention tool the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation programs to ensure that compensation is competitive but remains closely tied to performance that can be impacted by our executives and that the cngc believes is aligned with shareholder value in addition the cngc ensures that the goals and objectives of our performance based compensation plans are challenging in light of the expectations of and our commitments to our shareholders and other stakeholders as well as the internal expectations of the board and our company our incentive plans during fiscal the compensation earned by our neos for fiscal shows that our incentive plans are working as designed while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was slightly below the fiscal goal under our annual cash incentive plan as a result our ceos cash incentive payment for fiscal was million which was slightly less than his target payout compared to a maximum cash incentive payment of million for fiscal with respect to our long term performance share program our roi remained stable but was slightly below the target performance goal under this plan and our sales performance fell significantly short of our target performance goals under this plan as a result with respect to the portion of performance shares dependent on fiscal performance our ceo earned approximately percent less than his target opportunity compared to approximately percent above target in fiscal because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only did this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but will impact our ceos performance share payout for fiscal and fiscal as well who are the named executive officers covered in this proxy statement for fiscal our neos were michael t duke president and ceo mr duke joined our company in and has served in a number of positions prior to becoming president and ceo in february william s simon executive vice president president and ceo walmart us mr simon joined our company in and was promoted to his present position on june c douglas mcmillon executive vice president president and ceo walmart international mr mcmillon joined our company in and was promoted to his current position in february eduardo castro wright vice chairman responsible for global ecommerce and global sourcing mr castro wright joined our company in and assumed his current responsibilities on june charles m holley jr executive vice president and cfo mr holley joined the company in and was promoted to cfo on december thomas m schoewe retired executive vice president and cfo mr schoewe joined our company in and retired as cfo on december mr schoewe remained an executive vice president of our company through january to assist mr holley in transitioning to his new role we discuss the compensation of six neos rather than five because mr holley was promoted to cfo during fiscal and sec rules require disclosure for all individuals who served as cfo during any part of the last fiscal year impact of fiscal performance on executive compensation how was walmarts fiscal performance reflected in our executive compensation cash incentive plan while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was slightly below the fiscal performance goal under our annual cash incentive plan as a result our ceos cash incentive payment for fiscal was slightly less than the target payout each of our other neos with the exception of mr mcmillon whose incentive payout was based in part on the operating income of our international division also received an incentive payout below target table of contents moreover because our growth in operating income during fiscal was not as strong relative to our performance goals as it was in fiscal our neos earned less under our cash incentive plan for fiscal than for fiscal the following table compares our fiscal and fiscal payouts under our cash incentive plan company division fiscal cashincentivepayout of target fiscal cashincentivepayout of target total company walmart us international sams club as a result our neos who continued in the same positions earned a smaller cash incentive payment for fiscal as compared to fiscal for example our ceo earned a cash incentive payment for fiscal that was almost less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal michael t duke cashincentive fiscal year of target cash incentivepayment performance share plan with respect to our long term performance share plan our roi was slightly below the target performance goal under our long term incentive plan and our sales performance fell significantly short of our target performance goals under this plan as a result as shown in the table below we fell short of our performance share goals applicable to our neos by approximately percent to percent for fiscal compared to performance that was generally above target in fiscal because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only did this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but it will also impact our neos performance share payout for fiscal and fiscal as well company division performancevs fiscal performance share goals of target performancevs fiscal performance share goals of target total company walmart us international sams club as a result of our fiscal performance the combined value of mr dukes performance share payouts for fiscal fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million less than if we had reached our target performance share goals for fiscal assuming a stock price of per share which was the closing price of shares on the nyse on january actual payouts to our neos for the three year period ended january are shown below on page fiscal performance measures and performance goals what performance metrics were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal commensurate with the cngcs philosophy our neos fiscal tdc was substantially performance based each neos performance measures are based on the performance of our total company or a combination of the performance of our total company and the neos operating division this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating officers based on performance within their control or influence while still tying a significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company to drive the companys business strategies the performance measures applicable to our neos fiscal compensation were element of compensation fiscal performance metrics performanceperiod annual cash incentive operating income total company and or divisional sales walmart us only performance shares total company return on investment total company sales walmart us sales sams club sales international sales table of contents for purposes of the performance shares we define return on investment which is a non gaap measure as defined in the secs rules as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight the cngc chose these performance measures to align with the companys strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns the cngc concluded that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to incentivize our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders in addition the cngc believes that the combination and weighting of these performance metrics helps to mitigate the risk that our executives would be incentivized to pursue results with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts what were our specific performance targets for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to these targets in determining actual performance for purposes of our performance based plans the cngc made certain positive and negative adjustments to our reported results as provided by the terms of the plans these adjustments are intended to enable results for a particular fiscal year to be computed on a comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our incentive plans reward underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives for fiscal the most significant adjustment was to remove the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates other adjustments were to exclude the operating income related to recent acquisitions to exclude accruals for litigation settlements and to adjust for the accounting treatment of sales of prepaid phone cards as a result of this adjustment process the fiscal operating income and walmart us sales shown in the tables below differ from our publicly reported operating results for fiscal under gaap annual cash incentive payment goals the growth goals applicable to the cash incentive payments are expressed in terms of a percentage increase over our prior year performance for fiscal the threshold target

these goals consisted of two components placement goals and good faith efforts goals under our diversity goals program each officers cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not achieve applicable diversity goals for the fiscal year based on the report of our chief diversity officer the cngc determined that each neo satisfied his diversity goals for fiscal

ended january was based on the performance of our sams club division for fiscal when he served as president and ceo of that division and on the performance of our international division during fiscal and fiscal when he served as president and ceo of that division components of fiscal compensation and pay mix what are the other components of our neos compensation in addition to the annual cash incentive and long term performance shares described above our neos also receive a base salary and a service based restricted stock award these four elements comprise each neos total direct compensation or tdc consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance each neos annual restricted stock award is one third the target value of the neos performance share award table of contents what was the pay mix of our neos tdc in fiscal for fiscal base salary represented less than percent of each neos target tdc opportunity and a substantial majority of each neos target tdc opportunity was comprised of annual cash incentive and performance shares that is compensation that is contingent on satisfying a balance of performance measures that we believe have a meaningful impact on shareholder value as shown in the following charts the percentages within the charts may not total due to rounding the tdc amounts in the charts above reflect the compensation associated with mr simons and mr holleys current positions after their promotions on june and december respectively what other types of compensation did our neos receive in fiscal our neos may from time to time receive special awards special awards are typically granted for retention purposes or in recognition of extraordinary performance because these awards are not part of an neos annual compensation the special awards are not included in tdc in january as part of the fiscal executive compensation process our cngc approved special equity awards for messrs castro wright and mcmillon the cngc awarded mr castro wright a performance based restricted stock award to vest in june if the walmart com business increased its sales growth by at least percent as compared to fiscal which it substantially exceeded the cngc also approved a service based restricted stock award for mr mcmillon to reward his performance during fiscal and for retention purposes mr mcmillons award will vest in equal installments on the second fourth and fifth anniversaries after the grant date as a condition to receiving these awards mr castro wright and mr mcmillon were required to execute updated non competition agreements with walmart the terms of which are described on page table of contents what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations we provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a limited number of hours each year our neos also receive company paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance our neos also are entitled to benefits available to officers generally such as participation in the deferred compensation plan and benefits available to associates generally including a walmart discount card a limited percent match of purchases of shares through our stock purchase plan participation in the k plan medical benefits and foreign business travel insurance we provide these perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives fiscal total direct compensation opportunity what was the tdc for the neos in fiscal and the other years covered in the summary compensation table the following table shows the tdc established for each neo for fiscal through fiscal as shown in the table below target tdc represents the amounts our neos would receive if target performance goals are achieved maximum tdc represents the amounts that our neos would receive if maximum performance goals are achieved and is therefore intended to reflect the amounts our neos would receive only in the event of exceptional performance named executive officer fiscalyear basesalary annual cash incentive total cash equity tdc target max target max target max target max michael t duke william s simon c douglas mcmillon eduardo castro wright charles m holley jr thomas m schoewe as described above because our overall performance during fiscal was not as strong as our performance during fiscal our continuing neos realized less of their tdc opportunity during fiscal as compared to fiscal the tdc amounts shown for mr simon and mr holley above reflect the compensation associated with their current positions after their promotions on june and december respectively because mr simon and mr holley were first promoted to neo positions in fiscal only information for fiscal is included for them in the table above why is tdc different than the amounts shown in the summary compensation table inclusion of the tdc table above is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the cngcs decision making process when establishing neo compensation the summary compensation table that appears on page provides specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal years for our neos in the manner required by sec rules the amounts in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation opportunities approved by the cngc for our neos nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation that may actually be earned by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance conditions for example because the cngc typically grants annual equity awards to our neos prior to the start of the fiscal year the equity awards granted for fiscal appear on the summary compensation table as part of fiscal compensation table of contents what were the significant changes to our neos compensation for fiscal there were no significant changes to the basic tdc structure for neos in fiscal for fiscal the cngc selected total company and or divisional sales growth as the sales metric under our performance share program for corporate support and for our walmart us and sams club divisions replacing comparable store sales which had been used in previous years this change was intended to align our performance share goals more closely with our evolving business strategy which emphasizes productive growth leverage and returns in addition for executives responsible for the walmart us division walmart us total sales growth was added as a component of our cash incentive program in order to place a greater emphasis on sales performance for fiscal the base salary amounts for messrs duke schoewe castro wright and mcmillon remained relatively flat the fiscal base salary increases for those neos range from percent to percent which is consistent with annual base salary increases for management associates generally with respect to mr simon and mr holley their base salaries as well as their overall tdc opportunities were increased to reflect their promotions as the leaders of the walmart us operating division and as our cfo respectively and to align their target tdc to be competitive taking into consideration that both officers were new to their leadership roles the increases in the equity opportunities for messrs duke and mcmillon and the decrease in annual incentive opportunity for mr castro wright were made in light of their responsibilities and to align their compensation to be competitive in accordance with the cngcs objective of establishing target tdc that is in the top quartile of the peer groups for their respective positions how is tdc allocated between annual and long term compensation a majority of each neos fiscal tdc was allocated to performance shares which have a three year performance period an additional portion of fiscal tdc was allocated to restricted stock which for fiscal awards vests in three equal installments on the second third and fifth anniversaries of the grant date the following charts illustrate this allocation for our ceo and for our other neos as a group we believe that this mix appropriately balances annual and long term performance executive compensation philosophy and process who establishes the tdc at walmart the cngc is the committee of the board that is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the officers subject to section which includes the ceo and other neos the members of the cngc are independent see p and p for more information on the cngc the cngc met eight times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance metrics and performance goals applicable to neo compensation and the review of performance against those metrics table of contents what is the companys compensation philosophy in establishing tdc the companys philosophy is that a substantial portion of tdc should be tied to performance that drives the companys business strategies and that the executive can impact this philosophy focuses on the long term interests of shareholders and seeks to align the interests of the neos with the companys continued growth and long term performance goals applying this philosophy the cngc designs the executive compensation program to provide fair competitive compensation based on performance and contributions to the company provide incentives to attract and retain key executives instill a long term commitment to the company and develop a sense of company ownership how does the cngc establish tdc the process of setting tdc is a dynamic one the cngc considers among other things our overall financial and operating performance and business segments as applicable each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future and the peer group data and analyses see p for more detail generally our neos target tdc which would be earned if target performance goals are achieved place the neos in the top quartile of the peer groups for their respective positions the cngc believes that it is generally appropriate to position our neos target tdc at this level because as the worlds largest retailer the companys size extensive international presence and complex operations result in our neo jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at many of our peer group companies the target tdc opportunity for a new executive may be less than the top quartile of the peer groups depending on a number of factors particularly time and experience in a similar role in evaluating individual performance the cngc relied on annual performance evaluations for each neo and discussions with the neos supervisor the differences in tdc among our neos are due to many factors these factors include the differences in job scope and responsibilities the cngcs review of peer group compensation information through peer benchmarking expertise and years of experience historical compensation levels retention and succession considerations and individual and where relevant divisional performance the tdc levels set forth in the table on page represent the cngcs judgment as to the appropriate compensation opportunities in light of these factors how is tdc allocated among the various elements of compensation base salary in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates a relatively small percentage of tdc to base salary because our more senior executives typically have a large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of tdc attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our executives advance in our company annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment the target opportunity for the annual cash incentive is based on a percentage of base salary the cash incentive payout can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our ceos target opportunity is percent of his base salary and he can earn a cash incentive from percent of his base salary at threshold to a maximum of percent of his base salary the cash incentive earned depends on whether we achieve pre established performance goals and no payout will be made unless the threshold performance goals are met the cngc sets the performance goals in the first quarter of the fiscal year long term equity awards the balance of tdc generally the largest portion is then allocated between two forms of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity awards help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders as well as providing a retention tool consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance percent of the annual equity award is in the form of performance shares with the remaining percent granted in the form of restricted stock performance shares a performance share award gives the officer receiving it the right to receive a number of shares if we meet certain performance goals during a specified performance period generally performance shares granted to our table of contents executives have a three year performance period with the performance metrics set annually by the cngc the number of shares received at payout is based on the average performance over three fiscal years the neos can earn from percent at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target number of shares restricted stock the remaining percent of the equity value is in the form of restricted stock which for fiscal had a vesting schedule of three equal installments on the second fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting dates how does the cngc set performance goals the goals for our performance based plans are established in light of the operating plans for our company and each of its segments the companys operating plans to reach our strategic goals are reviewed by the board in light of economic conditions in our industry and in the broader markets in which we operate the companys operating plans are generally intended to be challenging and fiscal was no exception particularly given the economic environment for our core customer in order to achieve the target goals in our performance based plans our company and segments must perform in line with our sales operating income and return on investment expectations and operating plans at the time the goals were set in order to achieve the maximum goals the performance of our company and operating divisions would have to exceed those expectations by a significant amount generally goals for our international division require greater increases in operating income and sales relative to our other divisions this reflects our strategic growth plans for our international operations in light of market conditions and the level of capital investment required for growth in the international markets in which we operate the cngc generally attempts to set the threshold and maximum performance goals so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the cngc generally establishes the maximum performance goals at a level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance goals at a level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify a payment the performance goals established by the cngc for fiscal were challenging in light of the economic circumstances do our neos receive any compensation that is not included in tdc on occasion we grant our officers including our neos special awards that are not included in tdc these awards are generally in the form of performance based restricted stock or restricted stock and are intended for retention purposes and or to reward exceptional performance also the cngc may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual neos cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target payout for that neo based upon the cngcs subjective evaluation of that neos individual performance mr mcmillon and mr castro wright were granted special equity awards in january as described above on page our neos also receive limited perquisites as described above on page in addition our neos receive other benefits generally available to our associates such as participation in our k plan our stock purchase plan and other plans available to our officers such as our deferred compensation plan our neos also receive certain perquisites and supplemental benefits described above other compensation considerations are there any significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged in march the cngc established performance metrics and goals for the fiscal performance based plans there were two notable changes made in the long term equity award terms to further align the performance share program with the companys goals of improving growth leverage and returns in addition the changes are intended to provide more clarity for officers and to make the program more competitive first with respect to performance shares the sales growth weighting was increased from percent to percent and the return on investment weighting was reduced to percent from percent this change was made to provide more emphasis on sales for all officers in view of the companys goal of improving top line growth in light of the increase in the weighting of sales growth in the performance share plan sales growth was removed as a performance measure from the walmart us annual cash incentive plan for our executive officers as such mr simons fiscal annual cash incentive metrics will change to percent based on total company operating income and percent based on walmart us operating income with his performance share metrics based on percent walmart us sales and percent total company return on investment table of contents second restricted shares make up percent of the annual equity award for officers and traditionally have vested equally in the second fourth and fifth years after grant after researching market data and reviewing the equity programs of our peers it was determined that a five year vesting period was not competitive as such the cngc changed the vesting schedule for the annual restricted stock grant to vest in three years along with the performance shares this change is also intended to provide clarity to executives tdc opportunity because the full annual equity value will be eligible to vest every three years rather than over a five year period what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations of these neos provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews his annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc when establishing and approving the compensation of our ceo our chairman with support from our people division and the chair of the cngc reviews our ceos performance evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation beginning in early through fiscal watson wyattworldwide inc watson wyatt served as the cngcs independent consultant on executive compensation matters and assisted in assessing and establishing the compensation of our executive officers including our neos effective january watson wyatt merged with towers perrin forster crosby inc towers perrin to form towers watson co towers watson walmart management has historically engaged towers perrin to perform a variety of human resources and benefits consulting services and continues to engage towers watson to perform these services in light of the merger on february the cngc unanimously voted to engage irat kay company llc irat kay company as its independent executive compensation consultant going forward ira kay served as watson wyatts primary advisor to the cngc during the term of watson wyatts engagement by the cngc soon thereafter mr kay left irat kay company and joined pay governance llc the cngc then engaged pay governance llc as its independent executive compensation consultant under the terms of its engagement pay governance llc reports directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc has sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of pay governance llc and pay governance llc may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting services to walmart without the approval of the cngc how is peer group data used by the cngc our company is the worlds largest retailer by a wide margin and has significantly more extensive international operations than most publicly traded u s based retailers as a result the cngc believes that simply benchmarking neo compensation against a retail industry index would not provide the cngc with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our neos therefore the cngc reviews retail industry compensation survey data provided by hay group inc hay group and publicly available information for three peer groups to determine how our neos compensation compares to the compensation paid to executives in comparable positions at other companies since information regarding positions comparable to those of some of our neos is not available for many of the companies in our peer groups using three peer groups plus the hay group retail industry compensation survey data resulted in a larger number of comparable positions to which our neos compensation could be benchmarked the cngc uses benchmarking data when allocating each neos tdc among the various elements of compensation as a general guide to ensure that the amount of tdc allocated to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation we did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them while the benchmarking data is generally used for comparable positions we also review peer group data for retail ceo positions for our executives who are vice chairmen or lead our operating divisions these roles have significant responsibilities and we believe that these positions are often comparable to ceo positions at many of our peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint it is more likely that our operating division leaders would be recruited for a ceo position rather than a lateral move therefore we benchmark these executives compensation against that of ceos within our retail peer groups table of contents retail industry survey this survey allows us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary competitors in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly traded retail companies with significant u s operations with annual revenues exceeding approximately billion which were alimentation couche tard inc amazon com inc autonation inc best buy co inc bjs wholesale club inc costco wholesale corporation cvs caremark corporation dollar general

rite aid corporation safeway inc searsholdingscorporation staples inc supervalu inc target corporation the tjx companies inc walgreen co the fiscal target tdcs of the neos were in the top quartile of peer tdcs within the retail industry survey with respect to retail ceos in the retail industry survey the target tdc for messrs mcmillon castro wright and simon were in the third quartile select fortune we also benchmark our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by the people division with input by the cngcs independent consultant the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we excluded retailers from this group since those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also excluded companies with business models that are broadly divergent from ours such as financial institutions and energy companies the companies included in the select fortune when setting fiscal compensation were m company archer daniels

within this group top at the time of our benchmarking for fiscal we were approximately times larger in terms of annual revenue and approximately times larger in terms of market capitalization than the retail industry survey at the median to take into account this size discrepancy and the corresponding complexity of our neos job responsibilities we also benchmark our neos pay against the largest

in the top quartile of peer tdcs within this group what other information does the cngc consider when establishing tdc the cngc also reviews other information in the process of setting tdc although the cngc generally considers these factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized compensation the cngc also reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years the cngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company what are our practices for granting stock options and other equity awards option exercise prices we did not grant any stock options to our neos during fiscal and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances when we grant stock options the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our neos for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance shares and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible unless it is performance based a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos table of contents satisfies the requirements for deductibility under section m when designing neo compensation the cngc considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes the cngc retains the ability to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws similarly the cngc has the ability to require an neo to defer into the future any compensation that is not deductible under federal tax laws do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos all neos are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period following his termination of employment he will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment in this context a competing business generally means any retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by walmart these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company in connection with his retirement from the company we entered into a retirement agreement with mr schoewe see potential payments upon termination or change in control what types of retirement and other benefits are our neos eligible for our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our k plan and our serp which is a non qualified non defined benefit plan in which all associates in the u s participate to the extent the internal revenue code limits the amounts we would ordinarily contribute for their benefit under our k plan our neos do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or nonpayment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our cash incentive plan provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the recipient must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of our stock to further align the long term interests of our executives and our shareholders our board has approved the following stock ownership guidelines our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to five times his current annual base salary and each of our other executive officers and certain other officers must beginning on the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to a position covered by the stock ownership guidelines maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to three times his or her current annual base salary if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any shares that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in table of contents compliance with such guidelines until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines the board or the cngc can modify these guidelines in the event of dramatic and unexpected changes in the market value of our shares or in other circumstances that the board or the cngc deem appropriate are there any restrictions on the ability of neos to engage in speculative transactions involving company stock yes other than pursuant to a rule b plan that has been approved by our legal department our insider trading policy allows neos to trade in our stock only during open window periods and only after they have pre cleared transactions moreover neos may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange traded puts or calls or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share plan we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures namely earnings based measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share plan are capped at percent and percent of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe incentivize our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company table of contents summary compensation the summary compensation table below summarizes

now require that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve on a non binding advisory basis the compensation of our neos as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with sec rules we must provide this opportunity to our shareholders at least once every three years commencing with the annual shareholders meeting as described above under compensation discussion and analysis our executive compensation program is designed with an emphasis on performance and is intended to closely align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that compensation is closely tied to the performance that our executive officers can impact and that is likely to have an impact on shareholder value our compensation programs are also designed to balance long term performance with shorter term performance and to mitigate any risk that an executive officer would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single performance metric or operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole in the compensation discussion and analysis referred to above we discuss why we believe the compensation of our neos for fiscal properly reflected our companys performance in fiscal we urge you to read carefully the compensation discussion and analysis the compensation tables and the related narrative discussion in this proxy statement the vote on this proposal is advisory which means that the vote will not be binding on walmart the board or the cngc the cngc will review the results of the vote on this proposal in connection with its regular evaluations of our executive compensation program in view of the foregoing shareholders will vote on the following resolution at the annual shareholders meeting resolved that the companys shareholders hereby approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the named executive officers of walmart as disclosed in walmarts proxy statement for the annual shareholders meeting in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions compensation disclosure rules the board recommends that shareholders vote for this proposal table of contents proposal no advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation section a of the exchange act and related sec rules also require that we provide shareholders the opportunity to vote on a non binding advisory basis as to how frequently we should hold future non binding advisory votes on the compensation of our neos as disclosed in our annual proxy statement in accordance with sec rules which we refer to as an advisory vote on executive compensation sec rules provide that shareholders must have an opportunity to indicate whether they would prefer that we hold future advisory votes on executive compensation every year once every two years or once every three years the board has determined that holding an advisory vote on executive compensation every year is most appropriate for our company and recommends that you vote that we hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year the proxy card or voting instruction card if you hold your shares through a bank broker or other nominee holder provides shareholders with the opportunity to vote as to the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation accordingly in voting on this proposal you should mark your proxy card or voting instruction card for one year two years or three years based on your preference as to the frequency with which an advisory vote on executive compensation should be held if you have no preference you may choose to abstain from voting on this proposal this vote is advisory and will not be binding on walmart or the board the board will take the outcome of the vote into consideration when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation the board recommends that shareholders vote to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year shareholder proposals our company has received notice of the intention of shareholders to present five separate proposals for voting at the annual shareholders meeting the text of the shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received by our company unless otherwise noted all statements contained in a shareholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to wal mart stores inc c o mike bradshaw senior liaison to the board of directors southwest th street bentonville arkansas some of the shareholder proposals contain assertions about walmart or other matters that our company believes are incorrect but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions in our statements of opposition following these proposals the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals based on broader policy reasons as set forth in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no gender identity non discrimination policy whereas wal mart stores inc walmart does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or gender expression in its written employment policy according to the human rights campaign nearly of the fortune and of the fortune now prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression we believe that corporations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression have a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining employees from the widest talent pool sixteen states the district of columbia and more than cities and counties have laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on gender identity or expression our company has operations in and makes sales to institutions in states and cities that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression table of contents resolved the shareholders request that walmart amend its written equal employment opportunity policy to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression and substantially implement the policy supporting statement we believe employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or expression diminishes employee morale and productivity because state and local laws are inconsistent with respect to employment discrimination our company would benefit from a consistent corporate wide policy to enhance efforts to prevent discrimination resolve complaints internally access employees from the broadest talent pool and ensure a respectful and supportive atmosphere for all employees walmart will enhance its competitive edge by joining the growing ranks of companies guaranteeing equal opportunity for all employees walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no as one of the worlds largest private employers we are dedicated to building and retaining an inclusive and respectful workplace walmart employs million associates worldwide including approximately million associates in the united states our continued success as a business depends on an inclusive work environment that leverages the unique talents ideas perspectives and backgrounds of our associates sam walton founded our company by incorporating respect for the individual as a core basic belief in keeping with this belief we serve our associates by promoting an inclusive working environment through our employment practices in we received awards from national organizations and publications for our efforts to advance diversity and inclusion although the board is proud of the recognition that walmart has received for its achievements in diversity and inclusion the board recognizes that the true strength of diversity and inclusion lies not in the number of awards our company receives but in our commitment to leverage the rich mix of unique insights talents perspectives and experiences that each of our associates brings to our company one example of our companys ongoing efforts to fulfill its commitment to recognizing and celebrating the diversity of our associates is the creation of associate resource groups at our home office these groups serve a variety of associate communities including the lgbt community they were developed to increase cultural awareness to help foster development among associates sharing similar backgrounds and to advance the business by leveraging diversity of thought our companys discrimination harassment prevention policy makes clear that walmart will not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any aspect of our business on the basis of race color ancestry ethnicity religion sex pregnancy national origin age disability marital status veteran status sexual orientation genetic information or any other legally protected status in light of our companys ongoing concrete efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace for all of our associates and in view of the fact that this policy broadly prohibits discrimination or harassment based on any status protected by the law the board does not believe that a change to our discrimination harassment prevention policy is necessary at this time for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no political contributions report resolved that the shareholders of wal mart stores inc company hereby request that the company provide a report updated semi annually disclosing its policies and procedures for political contributions and expenditures both direct and indirect made with corporate funds monetary and non monetary contributions and expenditures direct and indirect used to participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office and used in any attempt to influence the general public or segments thereof with respect to elections or referenda the report shall include a an accounting through an itemized report that includes the identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each recipient of the companys funds that are used for political contributions or expenditures as described above and b the title s of the person s in the company who participated in making the decisions to make the political contribution or expenditure the report shall be presented to the board of directors audit committee or other relevant oversight committee and posted on the companys website table of contents stockholder supporting statement as long term shareholders of the company we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities these include any activities considered intervention in any political campaign under the internal revenue code such as direct and indirect political contributions to candidates political parties or political organizations independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal state or local candidates disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and critical for compliance with federal ethics laws moreover the supreme courts citizens united decision recognized the importance of political spending disclosure for shareholders when it said d isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way this transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages gaps in transparency and accountability may expose the company to reputational and business risks that could threaten long term shareholder value the company contributed at least million in corporate funds since the election cycle cq http moneyline cq com pml home do and national institute on money in state politics http www followthemoney org index phtml however relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the companys political expenditures for example the companys payments to trade associations used for political activities are undisclosed and unknown in many cases even management does not know how trade associations use their companys money politically the proposal asks the company to disclose all of its political spending including payments to trade associations and other tax exempt organizations for political purposes this would bring our company in line with a growing number of leading companies including aetna american electric power and microsoft that support political disclosure and accountability and present this information on their websites we urge your support for this critical governance reform walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political contributions consistent with the federal state and local laws governing such contributions we are fully committed to complying with all laws concerning political contributions including laws requiring public disclosure federal law currently prohibits corporations from making contributions directly to candidates for federal office and to national party committees as a result walmart does not make such contributions some of our associates voluntarily fund a political action committee wal pac that makes political contributions to state and federal candidates political party committees and or political action committees the activities of wal pac are subject to comprehensive regulation by the federal government including detailed disclosure requirements wal pac files monthly reports of receipts and disbursements with the federal election commission the fec as well as pre election and post election fec reports all political contributions over are shown in public information made available by the fec under the lobbying disclosure act of as amended walmart submits to congress quarterly reports which also are publicly available at the state level both walmarts and wal pacs political contributions also are subject to regulation although some states have not banned corporate contributions to candidates or political parties all states require that such contributions be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available as a result of the disclosures mandated by law the board has concluded that ample disclosure exists regarding our political contributions to alleviate the concerns cited in this proposal in addition the board believes that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution would place our company at a competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business strategies and priorities we are also involved in a number of legislative initiatives that could dramatically affect our business and operations because parties with adverse interests also participate in the political process for their own business reasons any unilaterally expanded disclosure by walmart could benefit these parties to the detriment of walmart and its shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal table of contents proposal no special shareowner meetings resolved shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary unilaterally to the fullest extent permitted by law to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders of of our outstanding common stock or the lowest percentage permitted by law above the power to call a special shareowner meeting this includes that such bylaw and or charter text will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language in regard to calling a special meeting that apply only to shareowners but not to management and or the board to the fullest extent permitted by law special meetings allow shareowners to vote on important matters such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings if shareowners cannot call special meetings management may become insulated and investor returns may suffer shareowner input on the timing of shareowner meetings is especially important during a major restructuring when events unfold quickly and issues may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal does not impact our boards current power to call a special meeting this proposal topic won more than support at cvs caremark sprint nextel safeway motorola and r r donnelley the leading proponents were nick rossi and william steiner the merit of this special shareowner meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for improvement in our companys reported corporate governance status the corporate library www thecorporatelibrary com an independent investment research firm rated our company d with high governance risk and very high concern for executive pay million for ceo michael duke and to million each for douglas mcmillon eduardo castro wright and brian cornell the corporate library said executive incentive pay remained poorly structured the executive pay committee had discretion to increase cash bonuses to above the target payout the corporate library said our performance based equity awards should be for at least a five year period not years plus our executive equity pay should have performance vesting features in order to assure full alignment with shareholder interests our company represented high governance risk due to poor executive pay policies our companys status as a family firm the walton familys ownership of almost half of our company and related party transactions with members of the board management and their affiliates douglas daft and linda wolf were the only directors from our directors who were on our combination committee for nominations and executive pay directors daft and wolf also attracted our highest negative votes we also had two inside directors and inside related directors independence concerns it is important that our future directors bring the right experience to our company however steven reinemund first elected to our board in brings experience from two d rated boards please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal special shareowner meetings yes on walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board believes that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best interests of our company or its shareholders consistent with delaware corporate law our bylaws provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called by a majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and ceo this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for a public company of our size because it allows our board according to its fiduciary obligations to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best interests of shareholders to convene a special meeting permitting shareholders with as little as ten percent of the outstanding shares to call special meetings for any reason and at any time could result in special shareholders meetings that are not in the best interests of our company and all of its shareholders we take shareholders meetings very seriously and take steps to provide shareholders with access to our shareholders meetings including making our shareholders meetings available via webcast holding a special meeting of our shareholders would be a costly undertaking involve substantial planning and require us to commit significant resources and attention to the legal and logistical elements of such a meeting for example we would incur legal printing and mailing costs associated with preparing and distributing the disclosure documents required for a special shareholders meeting table of contents the board also believes that our companys existing governance policies and practices provide shareholders with access to the board and members of senior management and offer ample opportunity for shareholders to express their views to management these governance policies include the annual election of all board members and a majority voting requirement for the election of directors in addition shareholders may submit shareholder proposals which if appropriate under the secs rules may be included in our annual proxy statement and voted on at our annual shareholders meeting furthermore the rules governing companies listed on the nyse and incorporated under delaware law require us to submit certain matters to a vote of shareholders for approval such as mergers large share issuances or similar transactions and the approval of equity based compensation plans for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no require supplier s to publish an annual sustainability report whereas the un global compact asks companies to embrace support and enact within their sphere of influence a set of core values in the areas of human rights labor standards the environment and anti corruption and whereas the un global compact accenture ceo study a new era of sustainability found that ceos reported the integration of sustainability issues into supply chains as the most significant performance gap in executing sustainability and whereas in order to ensure that workers in their supply chain are safe and treated fairly with respect and dignity some companies have established a supplier code of conduct by drawing on internationally recognized standards and whereas a study by aaron bernstein and christopher greenwald benchmarking corporate policies on labor and human rights in global supply chains pension and capital stewardship project labor and work life program harvard law school nov found a significant gap between general policies against labor and human rights abuse and more detailed standards and enforcement mechanisms required to carry them out and whereas given the merit of the old adage what gets measured gets done the long term interests of shareholders would be better served if companies were to require their suppliers to establish performance goals on human and worker rights and to measure and publicly report on performance using internationally recognized standards and measurement protocols and whereas in order to increase transparency and to improve performance such reports should include non compliance incidents actions taken to remedy those incidents and measures taken to contribute to the long term prevention or mitigation of such incidents and other issues of concern therefore be it resolved the shareholders request that the board of directors take the necessary steps to require that the companys supplier s publish annually an independently verifiable sustainability report among other important disclosures such report should include the suppliers objective assessments and measurements of performance on workplace safety and human and worker rights using internationally recognized standards indicators and measurement protocols in addition a report should include incidents of non compliance actions taken to remedy those incidents and measures taken to contribute to long term prevention and mitigation statement in support a companys best opportunity for early identification and mitigation of the risks posed by the human and labor rights violations of its suppliers is its development and rigorous implementation of a risk management framework to enable its monitoring and verification of its suppliers performance against internationally recognized standards of human and labor rights using measurable and verifiable indicators of performance an annual sustainability reporting requirement of its supplier s would strengthen the companys ability to assess its suppliers performance to hold its suppliers accountable help to drive performance improvements and enable investors to better understand and assess potential reputational and or operational risks walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no we have worked hard to be a leader in sustainability and social responsibility for years walmart has had in place supplier standards that address the treatment of workers by suppliers and supplier workplace safety we expect our suppliers to meet or exceed these standards our supplier standards are not merely goals that we encourage our suppliers to meet rather a suppliers failure to adhere to these standards may jeopardize that suppliers continued business relationship with walmart table of contents in furtherance of our standards for suppliers each year walmart conducts through walmarts internal auditors or through qualified third party auditors thousands of audits of the factories of suppliers of products for which walmart is the importer of record and of suppliers of private branded products if an audit reveals that a supplier is not complying with our standards we take appropriate action to address the problem up to and including termination of our relationship with the supplier or its non complying factory walmart maintains and continues to work daily to implement principles that serve what appears to be the ultimate purpose of the proposal that is to purchase products from suppliers that comply with high standards of legal and ethical treatment of workers and workplace safety we believe that requiring our suppliers to produce annual sustainability reports would force our suppliers to incur a significant expense in connection with the commitment of resources necessary to prepare and publish such reports this requirement and the increased expenses incurred by our suppliers in preparing these reports could ultimately lead to higher costs for walmart and higher prices for our customers this would not be in the best interests of walmarts shareholders and customers and would place walmart at a competitive disadvantage against those competitors whose supplier bases are not required to incur the expenses associated with mandated annual sustainability reports for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no climate change risk disclosure resolved wal mart shareholders request that the board of directors prepare by october at reasonable expense and omitting proprietary information a report disclosing the business risks related to climate change which may include impact of legislation and regulation impact of international accords indirect consequences of regulation or business physical impacts of climate change supporting statement as interpretive guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission on january pointed out legal technological political and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities or risks for companies wal mart has committed itself to dramatic measures to reduce carbon emissions and to support controversial political positions even as scientific and political factors related to global warming are rapidly changing documents and emails released from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia in late exposed vulnerabilities in the reliability and objectivity of key information provided to the united nations influential intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in the ipcc acknowledged its nobel prize winning report on global warming included inaccuracies and exaggerated claims based on questionable data sources according to the wal mart sustainability report currently we are supporting legislation in the u s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including the enactment of a well designed cap and trade system as the elections demonstrated the american people overwhelmingly rejected cap and trade in west virginia successful democratic senate candidate joe manchin ran a tv ad in which he picked up a rifle and used a copy of the cap and trade bill for target practice on february wal mart announced plans to eliminate million metric tons of emissions from its global supply chain by the end of thus imposing its political agenda on its suppliers on its website wal mart says its broad environmental goals include to be supplied percent by renewable energy to create zero waste these goals are neither achievable nor desirable they move wal mart beyond political correctness into the realm of the absurd revisiting the risks of climate change through this report may help wal mart avoid future embarrassment table of contents walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart is committed to serving our customers our communities our shareholders and our associates as part of that commitment we take pride in our leadership in corporate environmental sustainability our experience demonstrates that our efforts to reduce the direct and indirect effects of our business on the environment are beneficial for our business our shareholders and the communities that we serve we regularly consider the risks that climate factors may pose for our business not only as a part of our sustainability efforts but also as a part of managing our business operations around the world in accordance with recent sec pronouncements we publicly disclose perceived risks posed to our business by weather conditions whether as a result of climate change or otherwise the most recent disclosure of such risks is contained in the risk factors section of our annual report on form k for fiscal because walmart already analyzes potential material risks posed to our business by climate and other factors and discloses those risks annually to our shareholders we believe that a report of the type requested by the proposal would result in an unnecessary expense and use of management resources that would serve no purpose not already adequately served by the disclosures described above
