the rpf consisted of a the ffi premier fund a money market fund b the merrill lynch retirement preservation trust rpt a stable value collective trust maintained by bank of america and c synthetic and traditional gics in february bank of america trustee of the rpt terminated the rpt as part of the termination all rpt investors including the plan were required to transfer their funds out of the rpt as a result rpf assets invested in the rpt were liquidated and the proceeds were invested by the retirement plans committee in the premier fund on february beginning on march the rpf also began transitioning from a stable value investment strategy to a money market strategy as part of this transition underlying insurance wrapper contracts were terminated and underlying assets of the rpf other than its investment in the premier fund were liquidated and all proceeds of such sales were reinvested in the premier fund any assets remaining in the rpf on april were transitioned to the myretirement funds unless directed to another investment by the participant accordingly the rpf was effectively terminated on april as on that date no assets were invested in the rpf and the rpf was no longer an investment option as the rpf was terminated and no longer an investment option at january the following disclosures relate to the rpf at january average duration for all investment contracts in the rpf was yearsat january at january there were no reserves against the contract value for credit risk of the contracted issuer or otherwise traditional gics issued by an insurance company were valued by calculating the sum of the present values of all projected future cash flows of each investment the discount rate used was based on other similar maturity investment contracts at january the fair values of the synthetic gic wrapper contracts were calculated as the difference between the present value of the replacement cost of the wrapper contract and the present value of the contractually obligated payments in the original wrapper contract the underlying investments in the synthetic gics were debt securities that were traded primarily in over the counter markets and were valued at the last available bid price in the over the counter market or on the basis of values obtained by a pricing service the plan was able to withdraw from transamerica and bank of america n a both synthetic gics with a day and day written notice to the trustee there were no restrictions on access to funds for the payment of participant directed benefits the rpf entered into book value investment contracts bvcs also known as synthetic investment contracts bvcs were comprised of both investment and contractual components the investment component consisted of collective investment funds and a pooled portfolio of actively managed fixed income securities owned by the rpf referred to as covered assets this investment component was wrapped by contracts wrapper agreements issued by third party financial institutions generally insurance companies or banks wrapper providers these wrapper agreements generally provided for participant benefit withdrawals and investment transfers at the full contract value of the wrapper agreement i e principal plus accrued interest notwithstanding the actual market value of the underlying investments i e fair value of covered assets plus accrued interest in this manner wrapper agreements were designed to protect the fund from investment losses as a result of movements in interest rates however the wrapper agreements generally did not protect the fund from loss if an issuer of covered assets defaulted on payments of principal or interest a default by the issuer of a covered asset or wrapper provider on its obligation could have resulted in a decrease in the value of the funds assets the fund paid wrapper fees to the wrapper providers wrapper fees were negotiated separately with each issuer and were generally calculated based on a specified percentage of contract value in general if the contract value of the wrapper agreement exceeded the market value of the covered assets including accrued interest the wrapper provider became obligated to pay that difference to the fund in the event redemptions resulted in a total contract liquidation in the event there were partial redemptions that would otherwise cause the wrapper agreements crediting rate to fall below the wrapper provider was obligated to contribute to the fund an amount necessary to maintain the contracts crediting rate at not less than the circumstances under which payments were made and the timing of payments between the fund and the wrapper provider varied based on the terms of the wrapper agreement a synthetic gic provides for a guaranteed principal plus any credited interest that has accrued over a specified period of time through benefit responsive wrapper contracts issued by a third party which are backed by underlying assets the fair value of the synthetic gics was approximately millionat january included in the fair value of the synthetic gics was approximately millionat january attributable to wrapper contracts all investment contracts held in the portfolio at january were fully benefit responsive all contracts were effected directly between the rpf with merrill lynch as the trustee and the wrapper or issuer of the benefit responsive feature the rpf with merrill lynch as the trustee was prohibited from assigning or selling the contract to another party without the consent of the wrapper provider table of contentsall benefit responsive contracts held in the portfolio at january required that either the repayment of principal and interest credited to participants in the rpf was a financial obligation of the issuer of the investment contract or a wrapper contract provided assurance that the interest crediting rate would not be less than zero no event occurred such that the issuer of the investment contract or wrapper contract had to support full contract value the rpf invested in the rpt which at january consisted of a portfolio of investments to cash cash equivalent investments and short term highly liquid securities at january the rpt operated as a short term investment fund that sought to maintain a net asset value per share there were no restrictions on access to funds for the payment of participant directed benefits the rpf allowed participants daily access to the funds the terms of the investment contracts held in the portfolio at january permitted all participant initiated transactions with the rpf to occur at contract value with no conditions limits or restrictions permitted participant initiated transactions were those transactions allowed by the plan such as withdrawals for benefits or transfer to other funds within the plan the interest crediting rate for each investment contract was determined as follows the current dollar duration yield to maturity of the underlying investments plus or minus an adjustment for any difference between the contract value and fair value of securities taken over the contract value and the duration of the securities the key factors that could influence future crediting rates were changes to market interest rates changes in the market value of securities changes in the duration or weighted average life of securities and deposits or withdrawals to investment contracts all investment contracts had a minimum interest crediting rate and were reset at least quarterly as interest rates increase the market value of the underlying securities declines and when interest rates decline the market value of the underlying securities increases the relationship to future interest crediting rates based on a change in interest rates up or down will generally have minimal impact on the crediting rate since the change in rates will generally be offset by the change in market value except when there is a change in duration duration is a measure of average life of all cash flows in the portfolio on a present value basis a change in duration when market values decline interest rates rise reduces the crediting rate if duration shortens and increases the crediting rate if duration lengthens a change in duration when market values increase interest rates decline increases the crediting rate when duration shortens and decreases the crediting rate when duration lengthens finally any deposit or withdrawal to the investment contract impacts the crediting rate based on the relative size of the deposit or withdrawal the average yield earned by the entire rpf which may differ from the interest rate credited to participants in the rpf was during the year ended january this average yield was calculated by dividing the annualized earnings of all investments in the rpf irrespective of the interest rate credited to participants in the rpf by the fair value of all investments in the rpf the average yield earned by the entire rpf with an adjustment to reflect the actual interest rate credited to participants in the rpf was at january this average yield was calculated by dividing the annualized earnings credited to participants in the rpf irrespective of the actual earnings of the investments in the rpf by the fair value of all investments in the rpf the types of events that could have potentially limited the ability of the rpf to transact at contract value included premature termination of the contracts by the plan location closing layoffs plan termination bankruptcy mergers and early retirement incentives the rpf also maintained a liquidity protocol such that benefit responsive contracts were insulated in the portfolio access structure as of january of portfolio assets insulate the benefit responsive contracts the issuer was able to terminate a benefit responsive contract with the rpf upon occurrence of certain events including but not limited to a failure of the rpf to comply with contractual requirements a material misrepresentation of the rpf failure to remain a qualified plan under the code or a merger or termination of the plan if such an event occurred and remained uncured the issuer could terminate at a settlement amount other than the contract value table of contents investmentsthe trustee holds the plans investments and executes all investment transactions the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and market risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account
