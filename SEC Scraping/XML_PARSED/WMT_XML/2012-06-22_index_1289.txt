of the potential consequences of such a breach for the company the company employed the phrase may be vulnerable in the subject risk factor to indicate specifically that it is possible that such a

respectfully submit that disclosure regarding the amount of possible loss or range of possible loss as to such contingencies is not required as any loss amounts in connection with those contingencies
