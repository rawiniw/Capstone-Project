item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page company performance metrics page given walmart internationals continued growth please tell us what consideration was given to disclosing comparable store sales for this segment in this regard we note the increase in net sales for fiscal was due to positive comparable sales as well as growth in retail square feet letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page we include in our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda in our periodic reports a discussion of the primary factors for walmart internationals sales growth those primary factors have consisted of growth in retail square feet i e new store growth and growth from acquisitions with positive comparable sales being a lesser factor in that growth we believe that disclosing the factors underlying the growth of walmart international from year to year satisfies the requirements of item of regulation s k we disclose comparable store and club sales for our u s operations which measures the change in net sales for existing stores and clubs for a particular period from their net sales for the corresponding period in the previous year this metric is meaningful to investors within the context of the u s retail market where there is a single currency one inflationary market for the entire country and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year from time to time we have considered whether an aggregate international segment comparable store sales metric would be meaningful to investors considerations have included the number of countries in which we operate varying degrees of inflation across those countries varying changes in the value of local currencies relative to the u s dollar large variances in the sizes of stores operated by walmart international and the large number of different retail formats in which we operate internationally given those considerations the complexity of our international operations and the fact that we disclose the primary factors underlying the net sales increase for walmart international we continue to conclude that an aggregate comparable store sales metric for walmart international is not meaningful within the context of the walmart international segment please tell us and disclose how you estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs we open new stores and clubs with an understanding that a new store or club opened within a general geographic market may take away sales from any existing stores and clubs in that market we estimate this overall negative impact on existing stores and clubs by first comparing the year over year sales trends of impacted stores and clubs with non impacted stores and clubs in the same general geographical market impacted stores are in closer proximity to new stores and clubs than are non impacted stores and clubs second we estimate what the sales would have been for each impacted store and club as if the new store or club had not been opened and compare these estimated sales to the actual sales of the impacted stores and clubs we also use a third party to perform independent calculations to help us refine our estimates of the negative impacts of the new stores and clubs we believe this approach is reasonable because stores and clubs in a similar geographical market generally will have similar sales trends if no new stores and clubs are opened as they are generally affected by the same weather patterns state of the local economy and other local market factors below is a draft of our model disclosure based on fiscal actual results that is indicative of the disclosure we will make in future mdas to address this comment the planned changes have been underlined as we continue to add new stores and clubs in the u s we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page we estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs to those of nearby non impacted stores and clubs in each case as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened we note your comparable store and club sales include sales initiated online and you have continued to invest in your e commerce platforms please quantify for us the effect of ecommerce sales on comparable store sales for the periods presented to the extent that ecommerce sales have a measurable effect on your comparable store sale increases decreases please present your comparable store and club sales metric on both the basis of excluding ecommerce sales and including ecommerce sales for each of the periods presented in future filings or alternatively separately quantify the ecommerce activity included in this metric for each period presented please provide us with the text of your proposed future disclosure in your response ecommerce sales positively impacted the total u s comparable store and club sales percentages by approximately to for the fiscal years ended january and in future filings the company will separately quantify the impact on the total u s comparable store and club sales percentages below is a draft of the model disclosure that is indicative of the disclosure we will make in future mdas to address this comment the planned changes have been underlined calendar comparable store and club salescomparable store and club sales in the u s including fuel increased xx and xx in fiscal xx and xx respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year u s comparable store and club sales increased during fiscal xx as a result of improved average ticket and an increase in customer traffic u s comparable store sales increased during fiscal xx primarily improved average ticket as well as a broader assortment of items additionally ecommerce sales positively impacted the total u s comparable store and clubs sales percentages by xx and xx for fiscal xx and xx respectively returns page refer to the definition of roi return on investment a ratio and the denominator reconciliation from average total assets of continuing operations to average invested capital on page we note your statement that roi is considered a non gaap financial measure in your definition and the reconciliation we note you included an adjustment a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight within the denominator when computing the ratio tell us and disclose the basis of your use of a factor of and what this adjustment represents since the adjustment is not currently included in your annual gaap financial statements we are unclear about the basis of making the adjustment and the appropriateness of your letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page characterizing the roi as a non gaap measure under item e i and ii of regulation s k please explain or remove the statement that it is a non gaap measure as appropriate in future filings operating leases are not included in our balance sheet or captured in average total assets of continuing operations the beginning point for our calculation of average invested capital which measure is used as the denominator for our roi calculation however the numerator in our roi calculation adjusted operating income includes operating income generated from these leased right to use assets accordingly we believe the assets deployed in achieving the returns included in our roi calculation should correspond to those returns as a result we adjust average total assets of continuing operations for the estimated impact of those assets on invested capital by assuming the operating leases were capital leases for purposes of calculating roi as a practical accommodation and consistent with practices used by our credit ratings agencies we estimate the hypothetical capitalization of the operating leases using a convention of rent expense multiplied by a factor of eight as we discuss in our filings there are numerous methods for calculating roi and methods may differ by company in our future periodic reports we will disclose the basis and reasoning for including rent multiplied by a factor of eight in our average invested capital our calculation of roi is a non gaap financial measure because we calculate the measure using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition as stated above we also include a factor of eight for rent expense in the denominator of our calculation based on our calculation of roi and the definitions of what constitutes and does not constitute a non gaap financial measure appearing in regulation g and item e of regulation s k we believe our disclosure of roi as a non gaap financial measure is appropriate in our future periodic reports we will further explain why we believe roi is a non gaap financial measure results of operations page with a view to enhance understanding of your performance please provide a more robust discussion of the drivers behind the performance of your foreign operations as compared to u s operations to the extent underlying performances are significantly different or if they have different earning trends refer to item of regulation s k the walmart u s and sams club segments collectively comprise our u s operations and the walmart international segment comprises our foreign operations which is discussed in our disclosures in the overview section on page of our mda and on pages and as part of note segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements as each is incorporated into the referenced report our intention in the consolidated results of operations section of our mda is to provide the user an overview of our consolidated results and the drivers of those results on page we highlight the differences in gross profit rate between our segments on pages through we provide more detail for each of our segments in order to allow the reader to understand the relative performance of each segment and the drivers of each segments performance we provide relevant financial information and letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page metrics and explain the drivers of those line items including net sales gross profit rate operating expenses and operating income for each of our segments accordingly we believe our disclosures comply with item of regulation s k however as we reevaluate our disclosures in light of the staffs comment in our mdas contained in future periodic reports we file with the commission we will expand our discussion in the overview section of mda to better explain how each segment contributes differently to the companys overall results below is a draft of the model disclosure based on fiscal actual results that is indicative of the disclosure we will make in future mda to address this comment the planned changes have been underlined our operations consist of three reportable business segments walmart u s walmart international and sams club the walmart u s segment includes the companys mass merchant concept in the u s operating under the walmart or wal mart brand as well as walmart com of our three segments walmart u s is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit rate among our segments in addition walmart u s has historically contributed the greatest amount to the companys net sales and operating income the walmart international segment consists of the companys operations outside of the u s including various retail websites walmart international operates retail wholesale and other types of units including restaurants and some banks the overall gross profit rate for walmart international is lower than that of walmart u s because of the margin impact from walmart internationals wholesale and other units walmart international is our most rapidly growing segment growing primarily through new stores and acquisitions and in recent years has been growing its net sales and operating income at a faster rate than our other segments the sams club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the u s as well as samsclub com sams club operates as a membership club warehouse with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than the companys other segments as we have stated in our prior periodic reports filed with the commission walmart international is the primary growth engine of our company through both acquisitions and higher growth in new stores net sales and operating income growth for walmart international on a percentage basis have outpaced the net sales and operating income growth of our u s operations however excluding the impacts of acquisitions and currency exchange rate fluctuations underlying performance trends between our u s and foreign operations have been consistent over the past three years in that u s and foreign net sales and operating income are both growing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined each year and gross profit rate trends were similar should trends among our u s and foreign operations significantly change we will disclose the change in trends accordingly item financial statements and supplementary datanote taxes page letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page we note your disclosure of the use of global funding structures to lower your effective income tax rate in that regard tell us and disclose in further detail on how the global funding structures work in order to lower your effective income tax rate the global funding structures disclosed in the effective income tax rate reconciliation section of note to our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into the referenced filing refer to intercompany financing arrangements the company uses these arrangements with careful consideration of foreign and u s laws to fund much of the companys operating and growth needs in markets outside the u s the arrangements allow us flexibility to utilize cash generated in one foreign market to invest in our operations of another foreign market generally a common trait of the global funding structures is that they utilize a foreign legal entity to provide funds to foreign operating companies an effective tax rate benefit is produced from the global funding companies when income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates that are generally lower than the u s statutory rate in future periodic reports filed with the commission we will include additional disclosure in the cash equivalents and working capital section of the liquidity and capital resources discussion in our mda below is a draft of the model disclosure based on fiscal actual results that is indicative of the disclosure we will make in future mdas to address this comment the planned changes have been underlined we employ financing strategies e g our global funding structures in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u s and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through other funding sources ongoing cash flows generated from operations external borrowings or both accordingly we intend with only certain limited exceptions to continue to indefinitelyreinvest the companys cash and cash equivalents held outside of the u s in our foreign operations when the income earned either from operations or through our global funding structures and indefinitely reinvested outside of the u s is taxed at local country tax rates which are generally lower than the u s statutory rate we realize an effective tax rate benefit if our intentions with respect to reinvestmentwere to change most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the u s although any repatriations under current u s tax laws would be subject to u s federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits as ofjanuary andjanuary cash and cash equivalents of approximately millionand million respectively may not be freely transferable to the u s due to local laws or other restrictions we do not expect local laws other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of amounts held outside of the u s to have a material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or results of operations we will make similar changes as those shown above in the cash and cash equivalents section of the summary of significant accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference into our future periodic reports filed with the commission letter to the u s securities and exchange commissionjuly page additionally in our future periodic reports filed with the commission we will include additional disclosure in the effective income tax rate reconciliation section of the appropriate note to our consolidated financial statements included in or incorporated by reference into those reports below is a draft of the model disclosure based on fiscal actual results that is indicative of the disclosure we will make in such notes to our consolidated financial statements to address this comment the planned changes have been underlined the companys effective income tax rate is typically lower than the u s statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower taxed global operations including the use of global funding structures and certain u s tax credits as further discussed in the cash and cash equivalents section of the companys significant accounting policies in note x the companys non u s income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the u s statutory tax rate certain non u s earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the u s and are not subject to current u s income tax a reconciliation of the significant differences between the u s statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows fiscal years ended january
