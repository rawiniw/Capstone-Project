wal mart stores inc form k for the fiscal year ended january form k furnished february response dated june file no dear mr thompson this letter is in response to your letter dated june addressed to mr m brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer of wal mart stores inc the company for ease of review we have reproduced below in bold faced type the comment of the staff of the u s securities and exchange commission the commission contained in that letter and have provided our response in regular type form k furnished february we read your response to comment that the gain from the sale of yihaodian in china was not indicative of your normal business represented a strategic shift in e commerce strategy and that the gains from the shopping malls in chile had a much smaller impact in and you adjusted eps for u s discontinued real estate projects closure of stores globally and the accounting for certain leases the nature of these adjustments including yihaodian appears similar in that they are not indicative of your normal revenue generating operations we view these adjustments as being similar to the m gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile the magnitude of the adjustment with regards to the accounting for certain leases of appears similar to the magnitude of the sale of shopping malls in chile we also note in your k exhibit page you disclose the m gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile as one of only two reasons why membership and other income increased year over year with the other being the sale of yihaodian in china please explain in greater detail why an adjustment for the m gain on the sale of shopping malls in is not similar to what appears to be other infrequent real estate related adjustments made in and that we noted in this comment your disclosure may be inconsistent with the updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued on may please review the guidance particularly question when preparing your next earnings release we have reviewed your comment and also question in the updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued on may we use the compliance and disclosure interpretations in determining whether to adjust eps and believe we have applied a consistent approach we did not adjust eps for the gains on the sale of the shopping malls in chile shopping mall gains primarily because the gains spanned multiple quarters and were not significant for any individual quarter although the annual eps impact of the gains was and is similar in size to other items for which we have previously adjusted eps it was only per share per quarter for other items for which we have adjusted eps the gain or loss was in a single quarter had the eps impact been larger than for any individual quarter it would have been more likely that we would have adjusted eps for it we incorporated the shopping mall gains into our fiscal fourth quarter forecasted eps guidance which further contributed to our decision not to adjust eps for either quarter we did not incorporate these gains into our fiscal third quarter forecasted eps guidance as the amounts and timing were not yet reasonably known although we did not adjust eps for the shopping mall gains we provided transparency of the impact to investors through disclosure while the total gains were not material it was important to provide transparency because the gains contributed to a large percentage change from the comparable periods in the membership and other income line item of our consolidated statements of income in future earnings releases we will consider adjusting eps for items similar to the shopping mall gains which do not have a significant impact in an individual quarter but have a larger total impact across multiple quarters we will also consider providing additional discussion as to our reasons for not adjusting eps in accordance with the updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued on may
