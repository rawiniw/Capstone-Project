each bank to provide its offered quotation for deposits in the libor currency having the applicable index maturity commencing on the second london business day immediately following the interest determination date to prime banks in the london interbank market at approximately a m london time on the interest determination date those quotes will be for deposits in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in the libor currency in the market at that time but which principal amount shall be no less than million or its then equivalent in the libor currency if the libor currency is other than u s dollars if at least two of those banks provide a quotation the calculation agent will compute libor as the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided if fewer than two of those banks provide a quotation the calculation agent will request from three major banks in new york new york at approximately a m new york city time on the interest determination date quotations for loans having a term equal to the index maturity in the libor currency to leading european banks commencing on the second london business day immediately following the interest determination date these quotes will be for loans in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in the market at that time but which principal amount shall be no less than million or its then

participant either directly or indirectly the rules applicable to dtc and the dtc participants are on file with the sec according to dtc the foregoing information with respect to dtc has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation warranty or contract modification of any kind beneficial interests in a global note representing our outstanding debt securities and registered in the name of dtc or the nominee of dtc will be shown on and transfers of beneficial interests in the global note will be made only through records maintained by dtc and dtc participants when you purchase such debt securities the purchases must be effected by or through a direct dtc participant which will receive credit for the debt securities in its account on dtcs records upon that purchase you will become the beneficial owner of the purchased debt securities if you purchase through a direct dtc participant your interest will be recorded on the records of the direct dtc participant if you purchase through an indirect dtc participant your interest will be recorded on the records of the indirect dtc participant while the direct dtc participant through which the purchase is effected will reflect ownership of those debt securities in the account it maintains for the indirect dtc participant neither dtc nor we will have any knowledge of your individual ownership of the debt securities when you purchase debt securities through the dtc system you will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from dtc you should instead receive these confirmations and account statements from the dtc participant through which you purchase the debt securities the dtc participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers including if you are a customer of such dtc participant any beneficial interests you may hold in our debt securities table of contents we and the trustee will treat the person in whose name a global note representing our debt securities is registered whether dtc or its nominee as the owner of such global note for all purposes accordingly the trustee will pay all amounts payable with respect to such debt securities to the registered holder of such global note it is dtcs current practice upon receipt of any payment of distributions or liquidation amounts due on a global note to proportionately credit direct dtc participants accounts on the payment date based on their holdings of the relevant securities payments to you with respect to your beneficial interest in any of our debt securities in turn will be the responsibility of the dtc participants based on their respective customary

our request the trustee will send any redemption notices regarding debt securities of which you are the beneficial owner directly to dtc in accordance with current practice dtc will in turn inform the dtc participants which will then contact you as a beneficial holder of the debt securities that are the subject of the redemption notice dtcs current practice is to pass through any consent or voting rights to the direct dtc participants by using an omnibus proxy those direct dtc participants should in turn solicit votes and consents from you as the ultimate owner of debt securities either directly or through the indirect dtc participant through which you hold the debt securities or provide you with a proxy based on their respective customary practices as a general proposition we understand that under existing industry practices if we request the holders of our debt securities to take or if a beneficial owner of our debt securities wants to take any action that a holder of such debt securities is entitled to take under the indenture dtc would authorize the direct dtc participants holding the relevant beneficial interests in such debt securities to take that action the dtc participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding our debt securities through such dtc participants under applicable rules regulations and procedures dtc must make book entry transfers of our debt securities represented by global notes registered in the name of dtc or its nominee between direct dtc participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal of premium if any on interest on and the redemption price for such debt securities to the direct dtc participants whose accounts are credited with such debt securities as their interests appear those dtc participants with which investors have accounts to which such debt securities are credited must make similar book entry transfers and receive and transmit payments on behalf of their respective customers because dtc can only act on behalf of direct dtc participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect dtc participants and certain banks the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a security held in dtc to transfer or pledge that interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise take actions in respect of that interest may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest the laws of some states of the united states require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form in order to transfer or perfect a security interest in those securities consequently the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a security held in dtc to those persons or to perfect such a security interest may be limited dtc has advised that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities under the terms and conditions of the debt securities including without limitation the presentation of debt securities for exchange only at the direction of one or more of the direct dtc participants to whose accounts with dtc interests in the relevant debt securities are credited and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which

under applicable u s treasury regulations to be treated as a u s person payments of interest except as described below under original issue discount interest on debt securities that you beneficially own will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes original issue discount if you own debt securities issued with original issue discount oid you will be subject to special tax accounting rules as described in greater detail below in that case you should be aware that you generally must include oid in gross income as ordinary income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income however you generally will not be required to include separately in income cash payments received on the debt securities even if denominated as interest to the extent those payments do not constitute qualified stated interest as defined below if we determine that a particular debt security will be issued with oid an oid debt security we will disclose that determination in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities special rules described below apply to debt securities with a maturity of one year or less and debt securities that are denominated in a currency other than u s dollars foreign currency debt securities a debt security with an issue price that is less than the stated redemption price at maturity the sum of all payments to be made on the debt security other than qualified stated interest generally will be issued with oid in an amount equal to that difference if that difference is at least of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity the issue price of each debt security in a particular offering will be the first price at which a substantial amount of that particular offering is sold to the public the term qualified stated interest means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property other than debt instruments of the issuer and the interest to be paid meets all of the following conditions it is payable at least once per year it is payable over the entire term of the debt security and it is payable at a single fixed rate or subject to certain conditions based on one or more interest indices if we determine that particular debt securities of a series will bear interest that is not qualified stated interest we will disclose that determination in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities if you own a debt security issued with de minimis oid which is discount that is not oid because it is less than of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity table of contents you generally must include the de minimis oid in income at the time principal payments on the debt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid any amount of de minimis oid that you have included in income will be treated as capital gain certain of the debt securities may contain provisions permitting them to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity at our option and or at your option in addition if so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement we may have the option to extend the stated maturity of the debt securities of a series for an extension period oid debt securities containing those features may be subject to rules that differ from the general rules discussed herein if you are considering the purchase of oid debt securities with those features you should carefully examine the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements and should consult your own tax advisors with respect to those features since the tax consequences to you with respect to oid will depend in part on the particular terms and features of the debt securities if you own oid debt securities with a maturity upon issuance of more than one year you generally must include oid in income in advance of the receipt of some or all of the related cash payments using the constant yield method described in the following paragraphs this method takes into account the compounding of interest the amount of oid that you must include in income if you are the initial united states holder of an oid debt security is the sum of the daily portions of oid with respect to the debt security for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which you held that debt security accrued oid the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the oid allocable to that accrual period the accrual period for an oid debt security may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt security provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period the amount of oid allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess if any of the debt securitys adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to maturity determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period over the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period oid allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity other than a payment of qualified stated interest and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period special rules will apply for calculating oid for an initial short accrual period the adjusted issue price of a debt security at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued oid for each prior accrual period determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition or bond premium as described below and reduced by any payments previously made on the debt security other than a payment of qualified stated interest under these rules you will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of oid in successive accrual periods we are required to provide information returns stating the amount of oid accrued on debt securities held by persons of record other than corporations and other exempt holders floating rate debt securities are subject to special oid rules in the case of an oid debt security that is a floating rate debt security both the yield to maturity and qualified stated interest will be determined solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of oid as though the debt security will bear interest in all periods at a fixed rate generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to interest payments on the debt security on its date of issue or in the case of certain floating rate debt securities the rate that reflects the yield to maturity that is reasonably expected for the debt security additional rules may apply if either the interest on a floating rate debt security is based on more than one interest index or the principal amount of the debt security is indexed in any manner table of contents this discussion does not address the tax rules applicable to debt securities with an indexed principal amount or other contingent payments or debt securities that may be convertible into or exchangeable for other securities if you are considering the purchase of floating rate oid debt securities debt securities with indexed principal amounts or other contingent payments or debt securities that may be convertible into or exchangeable for other securities you should carefully examine the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities and should consult your own tax advisors regarding the u s federal income tax consequences to you of holding and disposing of those debt securities you may elect to treat all interest on any debt securities as oid and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above for purposes of this election interest includes stated interest acquisition discount oid de minimis oid market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium you must make this election for the taxable year in which you acquired the debt security and you may not revoke the election without the consent of the internal revenue service the irs if this election were to be made with respect to a debt security with market discount you would be deemed to have made an election to currently include in income market discount with respect to all other debt instruments having market discount that you acquire during the year of the election or thereafter as described below in market discount similarly if you make this election for a debt security that is acquired at a premium you will be deemed to have made an election to amortize bond premium with respect to all debt instruments having amortizable bond premium that you own or acquire during the year of the election or thereafter as described below in acquisition premium and amortizable bond premium you should consult with your own tax advisors about this election short term debt securities in the case of debt securities with a maturity upon issuance of one year or less short term debt securities all payments including all stated interest will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity and will not be qualified stated interest as a result you will generally be taxed on the discount instead of stated interest the discount will be equal to the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity over the issue price of a short term debt security unless you elect to compute this discount using tax basis instead of issue price in general individuals and certain other cash method united states holders of short term debt securities are not required to include accrued discount in their income currently unless they elect to do so but may be required to include stated interest in income as the income is received united states holders that report income for u s federal income tax purposes on the accrual method and certain other united states holders are required to accrue discount on short term debt securities as ordinary income on a straight line basis unless an election is made to accrue the discount according to a constant yield method based on daily compounding if you are not required and do not elect to include discount in income currently any gain you realize on the sale exchange or retirement of a short term debt security will generally be ordinary income to you to the extent of the discount accrued by you through the date of the sale exchange or retirement in addition if you are not required and do not elect to include discount in income currently you may be required to defer deductions for a portion of your interest expense with respect to any indebtedness attributable to the short term debt securities market discount if you purchase debt securities other than oid debt securities for an amount that is less than their stated redemption price at maturity or in the case of oid debt securities their adjusted issue price the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for u s federal income tax purposes unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount under the market discount rules you will be required to treat any principal payment on or any gain on the sale exchange retirement or other disposition of the debt securities as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the debt securities at the time of the payment or disposition in addition you may be required to defer until the maturity of the debt securities or their earlier disposition in a taxable transaction the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the debt securities you may elect table of contents on a debt security by debt security basis to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition you should consult your own tax advisors before making this election any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the debt securities unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method you may elect to include market discount in income currently as it accrues on either a ratable or constant interest method in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply your election to include market discount in income currently once made applies to all market discount obligations acquired by you on or after the first taxable year to which your election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs you should consult your own tax advisor before making this election acquisition premium and amortizable bond premium if you purchase oid debt securities for an amount that is greater than their adjusted issue price but equal to or less than the sum of all amounts payable on the debt securities after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest you will be considered to have purchased those debt securities at an acquisition premium under the acquisition premium rules the amount of oid that you must include in gross income with respect to those debt securities for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to that year if you purchase debt securities including oid debt securities for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on those debt securities after the purchase date other than qualified stated interest you will be considered to have purchased those debt securities at a premium and if they are oid debt securities you will not be required to include any oid in income you generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of those debt securities on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method in the case of debt securities that provide for alternative payment schedules bond premium is calculated by assuming that a you will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that maximizes your yield and b we will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that minimizes your yield except that we will be assumed to exercise call options in a manner that maximizes your yield if you do not elect to amortize bond premium that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the debt security your election to amortize premium on a constant yield method will also apply to all taxable debt obligations held or subsequently acquired by you on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies you may not revoke the election without the consent of the irs you should consult your own tax advisor before making this election sale exchange or retirement of debt securities your tax basis in the debt securities that you beneficially own will in general be your cost for those debt securities increased by oid market discount or any discount with respect to short term debt securities that you previously included in income and reduced by any amortized premium and any cash payments received with respect to those debt securities other than payments of qualified stated interest upon your sale exchange retirement or other taxable disposition of the debt securities you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize upon the sale exchange retirement or other disposition less an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid qualified stated interest which will be taxable as interest for u s federal income tax purposes if not previously taken into income and your adjusted tax basis in the debt securities except as described above with respect to short term debt securities or market discount and with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as described below with respect to foreign currency debt securities that gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale exchange retirement or other disposition the debt securities have been held for more than one year long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers are eligible for reduced rates of taxation the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations table of contents reset debt securities extension of maturity if so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement we or you may have the option to reset the interest rate the spread or the spread multiplier of the debt securities of a series in addition if so specified in the applicable prospectus supplement we may have the option to extend the stated maturity of the debt securities of a series for an extension period the u s federal income tax treatment of a debt security with respect to which such an option has been exercised is unclear and will depend in part on the terms established for such debt securities by us pursuant to the exercise of the option you may be treated for u s federal income tax purposes as having exchanged your debt securities for new debt securities with revised terms if this is the case you would realize gain or loss equal to the difference between the issue price of the new debt securities and your tax basis in the old debt securities although in certain circumstances such a deemed exchange may qualify as a tax free recapitalization if the exercise of the option is not treated as an exchange of old debt securities for new debt securities you will not recognize gain or loss as a result of such exercise you should carefully examine the applicable prospectus supplement and should consult your own tax advisor regarding the u s federal income tax consequences of the holding and disposition of such debt securities foreign currency debt securities payments of interest except as described above under original issue discount if you receive interest payments made in a foreign currency and you use the cash basis method of accounting you will be required to include in income the u s dollar value of the amount received determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into u s dollars you will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment if you use the accrual method of accounting you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods under the first method you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the u s dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued under the second method you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year or on the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period upon receipt of an interest payment of such debt securities including upon the sale of such debt securities the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income you will recognize exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the u s dollar value of such payment determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received and the u s dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be u s source gain or loss original issue discount oid on debt securities that are also foreign currency debt securities will be determined for any accrual period in the applicable foreign currency and then translated into u s dollars in the same manner as interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis as described above you will recognize exchange gain or loss when oid is paid including upon the sale of such debt security the receipt of proceeds table of contents which include amounts attributable to oid previously included in income to the extent of the difference between the u s dollar value of the accrued oid determined in the same manner as for accrued interest and the u s dollar value of such payment determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received for these purposes all receipts on a debt security will be viewed first as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the debt security second as receipts of previously accrued oid to the extent thereof with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first and third as the receipt of principal market discount and bond premium the amount of market discount on foreign currency debt securities includible in income will
