been included such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the sec and do not contain certain information included in the companys annual report to

determined primarily by the retail method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all of the walmart u s segments merchandise inventories the sams club segments merchandise and merchandise in our distribution warehouses are valued based on the weighted average cost using the lifo method inventories for walmart international operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in first out fifo method at april and our inventories valued at lifo approximate those inventories as if they were valued at fifo note long term debt on april the company issued million principal amount of its notes due and billion principal amount of its notes due the aggregate net proceeds from these note issuances were approximately billion the notes of each series require semi annual interest payments on april and october of each year commencing on october the notes due will mature on april and the notes due will mature on april the entire principal amount of the notes of each series is payable at maturity the notes of each series are senior unsecured obligations of the company note fair value measurements the company records and discloses certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities at their fair value the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction a liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop our own assumptions the disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at cost are as follows cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments long term debt the fair value is based on the companys current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements or where applicable quoted market prices the carrying value and fair value of our debt as of april and january are as follows april january amounts in millions carryingvalue fairvalue carryingvalue fairvalue long term debt additionally as of april and january the company held certain derivative asset and liability positions that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis the majority of the companys derivative instruments relate to interest rate swaps the fair values of these interest rate swaps have been measured in accordance with level inputs of the fair value hierarchy as of april and january the notional amounts and fair values of these interest rate swaps are as follows asset liability april january amounts in millions notionalamount fairvalue notionalamount fairvalue receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges receive floating rate pay fixed rate interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges total the fair values above are determined based on the income approach and the related inputs of the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves the estimated amounts the company would receive or pay upon a termination of the agreements relating to such instruments approximate the fair values as of the reporting dates note derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty if the derivative liability position exceeds certain thresholds the companys transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held million in cash collateral from these counterparties at april it is our policy to record cash collateral exclusive of any derivative asset and any collateral holdings are reflected in our accrued liabilities as amounts due to the counterparties furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral if the derivative liability position exceeds million as of april the company had no outstanding collateral postings in the event the company posts cash collateral the company would record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rates the contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in the companys earnings during the period instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change fair value instruments the company is party to receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating rate interest and receives fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the instruments the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the instruments being hedged the derivative instruments were assumed to be perfectly effective hedges and all changes in fair value of the hedges were recorded on the balance sheets with no net impact on the income statement these fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from february to may net investment instruments the company is party to cross currency interest rate swaps that hedge its net investment in the united kingdom the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed rate payments in one currency for fixed rate payments in another currency all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss offsetting the currency translation adjustment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss these instruments will mature on dates ranging from october to february the company has approximately billion of outstanding debt that is designated as a hedge of the companys net investment in the united kingdom as of april and january the company also has outstanding approximately billion of debt that is designated as a hedge of the companys net investment in japan at april and january respectively any translation of non u s denominated debt is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss offsetting the currency translation adjustment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss these instruments will mature on dates ranging from january to january cash flow instruments the company is party to receive floating rate pay fixed rate interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain non u s denominated debt the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk changes in the non u s benchmark interest rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings to offset the floating rate interest expense these cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from august to august the company is also party to receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non u s denominated debt the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non u s denominated debt changes in the currency exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings to offset the re measurement gain or loss on the non u s denominated debt these cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from september to march any ineffectiveness related to these instruments has been and is expected to be immaterial financial statement presentation hedging

appellate court issues a ruling that allows for the certification of a class or classes with a different size or scope and if there is a subsequent adverse verdict on the merits from which there is no successful appeal or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the litigation the resulting liability could be material to the companys financial condition or results of operations the plaintiffs also seek punitive damages which if awarded could result in the payment of additional amounts material to the companys financial condition or results of operations however because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the appeal from the district courts certification decision because of the uncertainty of the balance of the proceedings contemplated by the district court and because the companys liability if any arising from the litigation including the size of any damages award if plaintiffs are successful in the litigation or any negotiated settlement could vary widely the company cannot

target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the clean water act and the hazardous materials transportation statute this u s attorneys office contends among other things that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because those materials may be considered hazardous waste the government alleges that to comply with rcra the company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier the u s attorneys office in the northern district of california subsequently joined in this investigation the company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition including disposal by certified facilities is compliant with applicable laws and regulations while management cannot

operating income and comparable store sales the company measures the results of its segments using among other measures each segments operating income that includes certain corporate overhead allocations from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income including any corporate overhead allocations as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revisions is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability comparable store sales is a measure which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores by measuring the growth in sales for such stores for a particular period over the corresponding period in the prior year walmarts definition of comparable store sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations and expansions changes in format are excluded from comparable store sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in square footage of more than five percent comparable store sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussions of our consolidated results and the operating results of our walmart international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to convert the walmart international segments operating results from local currencies into u s dollars for reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not u s denominated in the second quarter of fiscal the company began implementing a new financial system in stages the first stage of the financial system implementation was in asda our u k subsidiary the second stage of implementation began in the united states puerto rico and canada on may in connection with the second stage of the implementation and coinciding with the improvements available in our new financial systems we plan to revise our methodology for valuing inventory under the retail method of accounting this will better align the accounting for inventory components with how the business is operated by measuring inventory at a more granular level this change would be effective may and reflected in the financial statements in the second quarter and for all prior periods presented this change in accounting is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the companys priority of growth focuses on sales growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys objective to increase our operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing our operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of our net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs our assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company manages working capital through free cash flow growth net sales three months ended april dollar amounts in millions net sales percentoftotal percentchange net sales percentoftotal walmart u s walmart international sams club net sales our net sales increased for the first quarter of fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal the increase in net sales is primarily due to our continued global expansion activities as we added of additional retail square footage compared to the first quarter of in addition billion of the increase in net sales was due to currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the walmart international segments net sales

fuel sales had a negative impact of percentage points for the three months ended april comparable store sales in the united states including fuel sales increased for the first quarter of fiscal compared to an increase of for the first quarter of fiscal the increase in comparable stores sales during the first quarter of fiscal is primarily due to higher fuel prices which have increased by approximately over the same period in the prior year this increase in fuel sales was partially offset by a reduction in customer traffic at certain stores located near areas with increases in the rate of unemployment increased gasoline prices deflation in certain merchandise categories and increased competitive activity leverage three months ended april dollar amounts in millions operatingincome percentoftotal percentincrease operatingincome percentoftotal walmart u s walmart international sams club other total operating income we believe growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales growth is a meaningful measure because it indicates how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses increased when compared to the prior year while net sales increased over the same period operating expenses grew at a slower rate than net sales primarily due to increased labor productivity and organizational changes implemented at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our operations operating income for the first quarter of fiscal we met our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales our operating income for the first quarter of fiscal grew by when compared to the prior year while net sales increased by over the same period all of our operating segments met this objective primarily due to increased labor productivity and organizational changes implemented at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our operations returns return on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was and for the trailing month periods ended april and respectively the period over period increase in roi is principally due to the improvement in adjusted operating income the timing of our chilean acquisition and the accrual for the settlement of wage and hour class action lawsuits in january we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows forthetwelvemonths endedapril dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of april certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of discontinued operations total assets as of april and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we ended the quarter with negative free cash flow of billion and positive free cash flow of million for the three months ended april and respectively the first quarters decrease in free cash flow is primarily the result of an increased investment in inventory free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the three months ended april and as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by used in financing activities in those periods threemonthsendedapril amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities results of operations the following

which is comparable to the gross profit margin reported for the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were and for the first quarter of fiscal and respectively this decrease is primarily due to increased labor productivity and organizational changes implemented at the end of fiscal designed to strengthen and streamline our operations our effective income tax rate was for the first quarter of fiscal which was comparable with the effective tax rate for the same period in the prior year we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be approximately to significant factors that may impact the annual effective tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations as a result of the factors discussed above we reported billion and billion of income from continuing operations for the fiscal quarters ended april and respectively walmart u s segment

fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal the increase was primarily due to significantly higher fuel prices this year compared to last year comparable club sales which increased in the first quarter of fiscal were positively impacted by percentage points due to the increase in fuel sales the remainder of the comparable club sales increase was primarily driven by continued strength in the fresh and health and wellness categories as well as improving sales in discretionary categories such as home apparel and jewelry gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal was comparable with the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased percentage points for the first quarter of fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal primarily due to

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we use these cash flows supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings to fund our operations and global expansion activities generally some or all of the remaining free cash flow if any funds the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases threemonthsendedapril amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were billion and billion for the first quarters of fiscal and respectively the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal was primarily attributable to an increased investment in inventory working capital current liabilities exceeded current assets by billion and billion at april and respectively our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at april and april we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payment of dividends cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of payments for property and equipment which were billion during each of the quarters ended april and these expenditures primarily relate to new store growth as well as remodeling costs for existing stores we expect to spend between billion and billion in capital expenditures during fiscal cash flows from financing activities during the first quarter of fiscal we increased our short term borrowings by billion to provide cash for a one time acceleration of accounts payables related to the system implementation that began on may for our operations in the u s puerto rico and canada we aggregated payments for the week of may into the first day of the week instead of our normal process of paying throughout the week on april the company issued million principal amount of its notes due and billion principal amount of its notes due the aggregate net proceeds from these note issuances were approximately billion the notes of each series require semi annual interest payments on april and october of each year commencing on october the notes due will mature on april and the notes due will mature on april the entire principal amount of the notes of each series is payable at maturity the notes of each series are senior unsecured obligations of the company dividends paid on march the companys board of directors approved an increase in the annual dividend for fiscal to per share an increase of over the dividends paid in fiscal the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments on april june september and january to holders of record on march may august and december respectively the company paid dividends of billion in each of the first quarters of fiscal and the company expects to pay dividends of approximately billion for the remainder of fiscal company share repurchase program from time to time we have repurchased shares of our common stock under a billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on june and announced on june on june the board of directors replaced the billion share repurchase program which had approximately billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date with a new billion share repurchase program announced on june as a result we have terminated and will make no further share repurchases under theprogram announced on june as was the case with the replaced share repurchase program the new program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased billion of our shares under the program or we earlier terminate or replace the program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued status we spent approximately billion and million for share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal years and respectively we consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things our current cash needs our capacity for leverage our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock capital resources management believes that cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining long term financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the recent past the following table details the ratings of the credit rating agencies that rated our outstanding indebtedness at april the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating rating agency commercialpaper long termdebt standard poors a aa moodys investors service p aa fitch ratings f aa dbrs limited r middle aa to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long term financing decisions at april and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings long term debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases total capitalization is defined as debt plus total walmart shareholders equity item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to
