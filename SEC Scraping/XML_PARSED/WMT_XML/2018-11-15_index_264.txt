metric walmart inc reconciliations of and other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non usd acquisitions until owned for months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three and nine months endedoctober three months ended october nine months ended october walmart

activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billionfor the nine months endedoctober which was relatively flat compared to billionfor the nine months endedoctober we generated free cash flow of billionfor the nine months endedoctober which was also relatively flatcompared to billionfor the nine months ended october net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were benefited by a decrease in tax payments primarily as a result of tax reform offset by the timing of vendor payments free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months endedoctober dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow adjusted epsadjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for such period management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following loss upon finalizing the sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil adjustment in the provisional amount related to tax reform and unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps we adjust for the following two items on a recurring basis each quarter tax reform the sec allows companies to record provisional amounts during a one year measurement period from the u s tax reform enactment date while the company recorded provisional amounts as of january the company adjusts such provisional amounts during fiscal as the company adjusted eps in fiscal for the impact of tax reform for consistency management adjusts eps for any fiscal changes to the provisional amounts unrealized gains and losses beginning in fiscal due to a change in u s accounting principles walmart is required to include unrealized gains losses of certain equity investments within net income the company s unrealized gains losses primarily relate to walmart s equity investment in jd com while the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com accordingly management adjusts eps for the unrealized jd com investment gains losses three months ended october diluted earnings per share reported eps adjustments pre tax impacttax impact net impactunrealized gains and losses on jd com investment loss on sale of majority stake in walmart brazil adjustment to provisional amount for tax reform net adjustments adjusted eps calculated based on nature of item including any realizable deductions and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions as previously disclosed in our second quarter ended october press release we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following the loss on the early extinguishment of certain debt the fcpa accrual based on discussions with government agencies regarding the possible resolution of the fcpa matter and the impairment of certain properties due to our decision to exit those properties in one of our international markets the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps three months ended october diluted earnings per share reported eps adjustments pre tax impacttax impact net impactloss on early extinguishment of debt fcpa accrual impairment of certain international properties net adjustments adjusted eps calculated based on nature of item and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions adjusted eps guidanceadjusted eps guidance is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes that adjusted eps guidance for fiscal is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for fiscal to the comparable prior period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmart s core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated adjusted eps guidance for fiscal by adjusting for the amount of the impact of the sale of a majority stake in

accepted accounting principles gaap as well as return on investment roi as measures to assess returns on assets management believes roi is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively the decline in roa was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months which was the result of the billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil unrealized loss on our jd com investment restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal and loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in roi was due to the decrease in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily driven by the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as the increase in average total assets primarily driven by the flipkart acquisition we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial measure numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roa and roi along with a reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa is as follows walmart inc return on assets and return on investment trailing twelve months trailing twelve months ended october ended october dollars in millions dollars in millions calculation of return on assets calculation of return on investment numerator numerator consolidated net income operating income denominator interest income average total assets depreciation and amortization return on assets roa rent adjusted operating income as of october denominator certain balance sheet data average total assets average accumulated depreciation total assets and amortization accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable accounts payable average accrued liabilities accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by non gaap measures free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activities of billion for the nine months ended october which was relatively flat compared to billion for the nine months ended october we generated free cash flow of billion for the nine months ended october which was also relatively flat compared to billion for the nine months ended october net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were benefited by a decrease in tax payments primarily as a result of tax reform offset by the timing of vendor payments free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months ended october dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow non gaap measures constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar into u s dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non usd acquisitions until owned for months throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the table below reflects the calculation of constant

walmart adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because it excludes certain amounts not excluded in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for such period management believes that adjusted eps is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition adjusted eps affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance we have calculated adjusted eps for the three months ended october by adjusting eps for the following loss upon finalizing the sale of a majority stake in walmart brazil adjustment in the provisional amount related to tax reform and unrealized gains and losses on the company s equity investment in jd com the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is eps we adjust for the following two items on a recurring basis each quarter tax reform the sec allows companies to record provisional amounts during a one year measurement period from the u s tax reform enactment date while the company recorded provisional amounts as of january the company adjusts such provisional amounts during fiscal as the company adjusted eps in fiscal for the impact of tax reform for consistency management adjusts eps for any fiscal changes to the provisional amounts unrealized gains and losses beginning in fiscal due to a change in u s accounting principles walmart is required to include unrealized gains losses of certain equity investments within net income the company s unrealized gains losses primarily relate to walmart s equity investment in jd com while the company s investment in jd com was a strategic decision for the company s retail operations in china management s measurement of that strategy is primarily focused on the walmart china financial results rather than the investment value of jd com accordingly management adjusts eps for the unrealized jd com investment gains losses non gaap

meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for

the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated adjusted eps guidance for fiscal by adjusting for the amount of the impact
