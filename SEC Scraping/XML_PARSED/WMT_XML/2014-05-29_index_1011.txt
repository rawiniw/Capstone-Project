inc dear shareholder wal mart stores inc walmart or the company is holding its annual shareholders meeting on june we are writing to ask for your support at the annual shareholders meeting by voting in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors the board on all proposals this letter is intended to supplement our proxy statement dated april which is available on walmarts corporate website at http stock walmart com annual reports particularly we are requesting your support by voting for proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and the election of s robson walton and michael t duke to the board pursuant to proposal no election of directors in deciding how to vote on the proposals we encourage you to read the relevant portions of our proxy statement and consider the supplemental information below proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation independent proxy advisory firm glass lewis co llc agreed with the board and recommended a vote for proposal no institutional shareholder services inc iss another proxy advisory firm has recommended a vote against this proposal we believe that isss analysis misconstrues the nature and operation of walmarts executive compensation program we believe isss recommendations are incorrect and inconsistent with prior years analyses the primary difference this year appears to be the submission of a letter dated may from ctw investment group ctw which contains a number of misrepresentations and intentionally misconstrues our executive compensation program ctw is a union affiliated group that has a long and consistent track record of opposing walmart with its sole motive being to undermine the company in an attempt to organize walmarts associates as iss acknowledges in its report isss own quantitative analysis shows that walmarts executive pay is of low concern with executive pay aligned with performance and that walmarts ceo pay is low relative to the median of its peers iss itself further acknowledges that e xecutive compensation has not historically been a particular concern at wal mart most features of its program meet best practice standards and ceo pay disclosed for fy raised no concerns in iss s pay for performance screen most features of the program and decisions made with respect to transitioning to a new ceo do not on an individual basis raise significant concern in the context of the company s size and comparable peers compensation programs and practices as described in our proxy statement walmarts executive compensation program emphasizes performance and is intended to closely align the interests of our named executive officers or neos with the interests of our shareholders the compensation nominating and governance committee the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that compensation is closely tied to aspects of our companys performance that our executive officers can impact and that are likely to have an impact on shareholder value moreover the compensation earned by our neos for the fiscal year ending january fiscal shows that our performance based incentive plans are working as designed our financial performance during fiscal was below our expectations at the beginning of the fiscal year and our executives pay for fiscal reflected that performance because fiscal operating income was lower than expected the management incentive plan payment or the cash bonus payment for each of our six neos was below target and significantly less as compared to the prior year michael t dukes bonus was approximately million less c douglas mcmillons bonus was nearly less william s simons was more than less charles m holley jr s was more than less neil m ashes was less and rosalind g brewers was less see annex ahereto for additional information regarding cash bonus payments to each of these individuals we fell short of sales and return on investment roi goals resulting in the lowest levels of performance share payouts in several years for our neos based on fiscal performance the performance share payouts for mr duke mr holley mr ashe and ms brewer were under percent of target for each while their three year performance cycle payout was less than percent of the target payout because our performance shares generally have a three year performance period with the ultimate payouts at the end of that period based on the average performance of the three fiscal years during that performance period the companys fiscal performance will also impact our neos performance share payouts in fiscal years and even after adjustments walmarts fiscal cash bonus and performance share payouts were historically low we believe our executive compensation program is working the way it should we acknowledged that our performance in fiscal did not meet our expectations and our executives compensation reflected that performance goals are rigorous and in line with operating plansiss claims that walmart has relaxed its performance goals from year to year this is not accurate the cngcs intent as described in the proxy statement is to set challenging but achievable goals each year the roi operating income and revenue goals used in our incentive compensation plans are set at the beginning of each fiscal year and are based on our operating plans and expectations at that time for fiscal these expectations took into account a difficult global retail operating environment as well as our planned investments in global ecommerce and expenses relating to ongoing investigations regarding alleged violations of the u s foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and compliance matters as described in the compensation discussion and analysis the cda of our proxy statement on page goals are set so that in order to achieve target payouts we must perform in line with our expectations and operating plans iss appears to believe it is troubling that the roi goals under walmarts long term performance share program have declined over the past few years however this decline does not represent a decreasing difficulty in roi goals we have been very deliberate about our strategy for continued growth and the planned investments we are making in the business as reported in our quarterly earnings releases recent decreases in our roi are largely driven by capital expenditures such as strategic investments in new and existing stores acquisitions investments in ecommerce and technology and fcpa related investigations and global compliance enhancements we believe that criticism of our recent declines in roi is really criticism of our business model and strategic direction and not an executive compensation issue we believe that the increase in our stock price during the last five fiscal years which has resulted in more than a billion increase in our market capitalization reflects that our shareholders believe in our strategies iss further justifies its recommendation in part by citing d eclines in performance targets that do not result in any decline in related rewards even as the company s performance continues to lag peers with respect to roi walmarts roi does not lag peers even as the cash and stock incentives earned by our neos declined significantly in fiscal our fiscal roi of places us above the thpercentile of our retail peer group moreover there is no long term downward trend in our sales and operating income goals as iss acknowledges in fact it is not even correct to say that our sales and operating goals in fiscal were lower than the prior year for fiscal increases in sales and operating income were necessary to achieve target performance goals just at a lower rate of increase than for fiscal further fiscal and fiscal operating income goals required increased growth rates as compared to the prior fiscal years we do not believe it would be prudent to set unrealistic goals that are not achievable and that would not serve to incentivize performance rather we set challenging but achievable goals that are consistent with our operating plans and expectations as noted above during fiscal we fell short of our operating plans and expectations and as a result the performance based compensation realized by our neos was well below target levels clearly the goals set by the cngc for fiscal were not excessively easy to achieve and we believe that isss characterization of the goals as relaxed is incorrect and reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose and operation of our incentive compensation plans adjustments to operating results are appropriate and the result of a rigorous processiss also criticizes adjustments to operating results under our incentive compensation plans even though its report acknowledges that such adjustments are not an uncommon practice we believe that adjustments for items such as store closings and restructurings are appropriate and are intended to cause incentive pay to be calculated on a comparable basis from year to year for example we do not want a decision regarding a restructuring or store closing which may be in the long term best interests of the company and our shareholders to be influenced by a consideration of how it might impact our executives bonuses our compensation plans should not disincentivize executives from making the right decisions that support our strategy for our business adjustments are not intended to increase incentive pay or enrich executives in some years such as fiscal and fiscal the adjustment process has resulted in a reduction in incentive payouts adjustments are governed by the terms of our incentive compensation plans and a rigorous oversight and analysis process and are not outcome driven special retention awards are appropriate in the context of a ceo transitioniss criticizes special restricted stock grants to our neos made for retention purposes in january these grants were made in the context of a ceo transition announced on november that took effect on february we have successfully executed the last two ceo transitions primarily due to the boards strong focus on succession planning and bench strength of our leadership team additionally the cngc believes that maintaining our current leadership team is instrumental in successfully achieving our strategic objectives we believe that these special restricted stock grants were appropriate and reasonable in order to retain our senior leadership team for future succession planning and delivery of our ongoing strategic initiatives feather in performance shares are reasonable and appropriateiss also objects to grants of additional long term performance shares for ongoing performance cycles made to certain of our neos in january we note that although we do not grant additional performance shares for ongoing performance cycles as a matter of course we have made such grants in limited circumstances where we believe there is a compelling reason to do so we have clearly disclosed these grants in our proxy statement in past years and we have never received any negative feedback from any shareholder or from iss for that matter as iss acknowledges the award for mr mcmillon was designed to deliver the potential to earn a payout at the appropriate level of target performance shares for his new position for each year he holds that position the additional performance shares for mr ashe and ms brewer as with the special restricted stock grants were made in the context of our ongoing ceo transition and succession planning and reflected the results of the rigorous benchmarking process described in our cda the divisions run by our leaders are similar in size or larger than many of our retail peer companies making our leaders very attractive to other companies the additional performance shares were granted to maintain competitive total direct compensation for mr ashe and ms brewer moreover it is important to note that all unvested performance shares are forfeited upon separation from the company and unlike some companies we do not accelerate the vesting of unvested performance shares when an executive retires both of our last two ceos forfeited all unvested performance shares for ongoing performance cycles upon retirement from our company specifically upon his retirement h lee scott jr forfeited unvested performance shares while michael t duke forfeited unvested performance shares upon his retirement election of s robson walton and michael t duke to the boardiss has also recommended that shareholders vote against the election of s robson walton and michael t duke to the board iss bases this recommendation on the assertion that the board has not to date provid ed meaningful information to shareholders about any specific findingson the fcpa related investigations and whether executives will be held accountable for related compliance failures emphasis added the audit committee and the company are following the appropriate protocol for an independent thorough investigationas the company has previously reported the audit committee of the board is conducting an independent internal investigation into among other things alleged violations of the fcpa and alleged misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries also as previously reported to shareholders the company voluntarily disclosed the audit committees investigative activity on these matters to the u s department of justice and the u s securities and exchange commission both of which are conducting their own external investigations of these matters we believe that isss recommendation that shareholders vote against the election of mr walton and mr duke because the board has not disclosed specific findings regarding the fcpa related investigations is at odds with the appropriate conduct of such internal and external investigations we further believe that isss request for disclosure of specific findings with respect to these ongoing investigations is contrary to the best interests of the company and our shareholders because such a disclosure could interfere with or distract from the ongoing investigations is impractical given that no final conclusions or findings have been made and could adversely impact the companys position in any current or future legal proceedings that may relate to these matters the audit committee of the board will continue to oversee a thorough independent internal investigation of these matters and the company will continue to cooperate with all governmental authorities investigating these issues the company cannot comment on any specific findings of these ongoing investigations this course of action is consistent with best practices for ensuring that these types of matters are thoroughly investigated and are timely resolved iss acknowledges that the company has made significant progress in enhancing its compliance programimportantly iss acknowledges that the c ompany has clearly made significant changes to its compliance programs in the past year and provided better disclosure regarding its compliance objectives the board including mr walton and mr duke has been instrumental in achieving these compliance enhancements which have addressed anti corruption controls and procedures in addition to a variety of other topics as just a few examples of the companys recent accomplishments the company has revised a number of key controls and policies on anti corruption and other issues designed and implemented a robust anti corruption training program providing training to more than key associates leveraged its strengths in key disciplines around the world and provided closer coordination and integration by placing the global compliance ethics investigations and legal functions under one organization reporting to the companys executive vice president global governance and corporate secretary appointed and organized compliance personnel based not only on geographic considerations but also on topic related expertise identifying subject matter areas and designating global subject matter leaders for these areas that walmarts compliance program is addressing throughout the organization begun the process of planning for and appointing teams of compliance monitors in all of its international retail markets with such teams being responsible for reviewing the companys retail operations and assisting the business in maintaining compliance with local laws and policies enhanced the training capabilities of walmarts global ethics organization delivering new orientation materials for field and corporate office associates a statement of ethics e learning module for new and existing corporate office associates and instructor led ethics training for new or recently promoted officers established global escalation and review procedures that identify specific categories of allegations that must be reported directly to the companys global ethics office in bentonville arkansas established a compliance and ethics committee in each of the companys international retail markets to help the company operate in accordance with the highest ethical business standards improved the companys existing program for detecting and combating money laundering activities and related fraud and created a centralized international licensing and permits team charged with developing improved processes to monitor and track the companys licenses and permits across all retail markets andimplemented new compliance systems and technologies for screening third parties who interact with governmental agencies for anti corruption and other compliance risks managing licenses and permits in the companys retail markets and capturing monitoring data and tracking remediation of compliance issues identified by the companys compliance monitors as iss recognizes the company has provided increased transparency regarding the enhancements to its global compliance program shareholders may review additional information about these enhancements as well as our overall global responsibility initiatives in walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year and walmarts global responsibility report available at http corporate walmart com global responsibility global compliance program report on fiscal year and http corporate walmart com global responsibility environment sustainability global responsibility report respectively conclusionfor the foregoing reasons we believe isss recommendations that shareholders vote against proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and against the election of s robson walton and michael t duke to the board are wrong we ask that if you review isss recommendations in connection with your voting determinations you consider factors outside their evaluation which we describe in our proxy statement and above and vote for proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and the election of s robson walton and michael t duke to the board pursuant to proposal no election of directors thank you for your
