we are committed to doing business the right way were constantly striving to earn and keep the trust of our customers and the communities where we work and live one way we meet that commitment is through the companys ethics and compliance program our program helps our company identify key risks in our business develop standards and processes to address those risks and then bring those standards and processes to life in our business over the last few years weve made significant investments to enhance these capabilities we have highlighted some of that work in prior annual reports on our ethics and compliance program and also in walmarts annual global responsibility reports because our business and the world are constantly changing over this last year we continued to develop and refine our companys governance processes im pleased to share some details from those efforts in this third annual report on our ethics and compliance program in this coming year and the years ahead the company will continue to focus on building a world class ethics and compliance program to prevent detect and remediate issues that arise in a growing business to do that we must embed our ethics and compliance processes in our business and challenge ourselves to continually improve this report highlights some of the latest progress on this journey doug mcmillon president and ceo wal mart stores inc april walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year i refining and evaluating our program enhancements walmarts culture emphasizes integrity and respect for others this cultural foundation is critical to walmarts success because it provides our associates with shared expectations and a common understanding of what is important our ethics and compliance program builds on that cultural foundation with the many complex issues our business confronts we need both a strong culture and effective governance to achieve our goals accordingly several years ago we began implementing significant structural changes to enhance our ethics and compliance efforts these changes have now brought into one program many of the functions and processes that help our company follow the laws and regulations that govern our business having a unified global program has brought a consistent coordinated approach to our compliance work and has allowed us to apply learnings from one part of our business across all of our operations as part of our oversight of the companys compliance program for the last several years the companys senior management has worked with the audit committee of walmarts board of directors to identify high priority projects to move the program forward the company continued this approach in the fiscal year ended january fy early in fy the company and the audit committee identified such high priority objectives the objectives those objectives were selected based on information we gathered about our operations throughout the year in addition to the normal feedback we receive in our business we conduct annual risk assessments in each of our retail markets and also use innovative systems to collect data on our compliance efforts several of those systems are discussed below this focus on data and analytics helps us to understand our risks and prioritize our efforts as in past years the boards compensation nominating and governance committee the cngc conditioned a portion of the compensation for the companys most senior executives on demonstrating adequate progress in achieving the objectives under the oversight of the audit committee and cngc the company assigned responsibility for each of the objectives to one or more members of our senior executive team our senior management regularly reported to the audit committee and cngc on the status of the objectives throughout the year at the end of fy the audit committee conducted a review and concluded that the company achieved adequate progress on all of the years objectives in light of these results the cngc elected not to exercise its discretion to reduce our executives compensation this report discusses some of the objectives that the company achieved over the last year the report also provides data and examples from the companys broader ethics and compliance program to provide context for our efforts and show how the companys governance processes have continued to improve we believe that this process of continuous improvement is critical to our companys success walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year a integration of ethics and compliance one of the most significant changes this year involved merging our global ethics and compliance programs walmart started its ethics office over a decade ago as a place where our associates could turn for advice and guidance over time the ethics program evolved and took on an increasing role in educating our associates on ethical and policy issues the ethics program maintains walmarts statement of ethics which sets out our companys fundamental expectations for our board our management and every associate to act with integrity and objectivity we publish our statement of ethics in languages and disseminate it in a variety of ways to make it accessible to our associates and business partners a copy of the current statement of ethics can be found here the ethics group also provides confidential mechanisms for individuals to ask questions seek advice and report concerns the company makes associates aware of these communication avenues in a variety of ways including associate training messages from managers and senior leaders and reminders such as posters in our stores clubs and other facilities im pleased to report that our associates and stakeholders are utilizing these communication channels in fy the number of contacts we received from internal and external stakeholders increased by this is the fifth consecutive year that the number of contacts has grown the increasing contacts let us know that people are aware of these resources and feel comfortable using them as these contacts come in the ethics group tracks the information we obtain works with the appropriate group to investigate concerns and coordinates with the business to resolve issues that are identified approximately of the contacts we received last year were classified as general questions rather than issues relating to ethics matters but we still find these communication methods helpful for providing our customers and associates with opportunities to give feedback and ask questions as our ethics and compliance programs developed over the last few years we decided it was time to refine our overall design our ethics and compliance functions are closely related as both are involved in identifying and preventing risks responding to issues and educating associates we therefore decided to merge the departments this merger has enabled better collaboration efficiency and effectiveness across the groups for example as the individuals who handle ethics contacts identify trends in compliance matters that are reported to the company they are better positioned to raise those issues with their colleagues on the compliance team who manage those subjects additionally by working together the ethics and compliance groups have consolidated our training and tailored it to better engage our associates in the learning process b third party review of our recent compliance initiatives after spending several years enhancing the compliance program in fy walmart commissioned a third party evaluation of how effectively we have implemented these changes the company engaged an external expert to assess our improvements to the compliance program in a number of international markets this review helped us to ensure that we are walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year moving in the right direction and to identify areas where we can make further progress we continue to look for ways to refine and evolve our program design and to improve the execution of ethics and compliance initiatives ii taking a proactive approach to anticorruption we are committed to maintaining a world class anticorruption program and continue to devote significant resources to do so as part of this continuous effort we look for new ways and new technology to manage our risks efficiently and effectively a continuous improvement in anticorruption walmarts anticorruption program was designed and implemented based on the advice and guidance of internal and external experts this design includes a global anticorruption policy and market specific anticorruption procedures that address a number of topics such as due diligence in engaging third parties business expenditures charitable contributions and sponsorships licenses and permits acquisition or lease of property from government entities government inspections recordkeeping and reporting allegations among others we continued to build and refine the program in fy at the end of the year we had a team of more than dedicated anticorruption associates who live and work around the world but who report centrally and are led by a dedicated global anticorruption officer together these anticorruption associates conduct due diligence and an annual risk assessment develop and provide anticorruption training and messaging oversee the implementation of anticorruption policies and procedures and monitor and evaluate our program in fy we expanded our program for regularly monitoring our companys performance in implementing our anticorruption policies and procedures the company now has a global continuous improvement team that constantly assesses and improves the implementation of the program in all of our retail markets this monitoring provides feedback to the business on how they follow the companys anticorruption controls so any issues are identified and addressed early this monitoring does not replace the work of our internal audit team which continues to perform its independent auditing function rather we view this monitoring as an additional line of defense against anticorruption risk b managing our third party risk like many businesses we sometimes need third parties to interact with the government on our behalf these third party intermediaries can help us with regular business activities such as responding to government requests for information handling legal or regulatory proceedings and real estate design and construction these third parties provide needed expertise and make our processes more efficient but because these individuals and companies interact with government officials around the world they also impact our risk profile we seek to be both innovative and deliberate in managing this risk we have created a thorough process to screen and conduct due diligence on potential third party partners as part walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year of that process we worked with external experts to create a customized electronic system that screens for third party intermediaries in our business and conducts due diligence on individuals and companies who seek to represent us additionally when we contract with third party intermediaries we require them to adopt commitments to follow our anticorruption policies we want to help our third party partners understand and apply these anticorruption standards so weve invested heavily in anticorruption training as of the end of fy we have provided anticorruption training to over third party companies and groups in addition to reducing our risk by providing this walmart developed training we have also provided our third party partners with the ability to share our anticorruption e learning training with others throughout their organization this past year we also developed what we consider to be a leading practice in anticorruption compliance in addition to the screening due diligence contractual commitments and training that we utilize we partnered with external experts to develop a methodology for proactively auditing a sample of our third party partners in our higher risk markets these audits are not triggered in response to a concern or allegation about the third party rather under our new protocol we selected a sample of companies for an audit based on several factors including the risks associated with the region where the third party operates and the type of service that it provides through this process we were able to examine the way that the third parties responded to our anticorruption program and identified areas where we can continue to improve our training and controls because of the insight these proactive audits provided in fiscal year fy we intend to expand this program to all of our retail markets iii elevating the customer experience through food safety and quality walmart serves millions of customers in thousands of stores around the globe each day because we touch the lives of so many people we have an important responsibility and unique opportunity to advance food safety and improve public health providing safe and affordable food to our customers is one of the reasons we continue to be successful in an increasingly competitive environment as leaders in the retail food business maintaining a progressive and effective food safety management system is a critical part of our continued success a implementing the global food safety initiative in addition to promoting food safety within our stores and clubs walmart has enhanced food safety in the marketplace by helping to create and implement recognized standards for cleanliness and safety in food production facilities as noted last year walmart was a founder of the global food safety initiative gfsi gfsi is a global multi stakeholder effort that establishes appropriate food safety standards for various types of food production operations the gfsi food safety standards are internationally recognized and meet or exceed regulatory standards worldwide additional information on gfsi can be found here walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year the process of obtaining gfsi certification for a facility is intensive and may take several years since first requiring private label suppliers to obtain this certification in we have extended the requirement to other food products including fresh produce meat fish poultry and ready to eat foods as a result weve seen reductions in recalls while simultaneously promoting confidence in the food supply in fy walmart continued to build on this progress internationally by significantly increasing the percentage of company owned and private label food production factories certified to one of the gfsi recognized standards the number of walmarts international suppliers of private brand products who are certified against a gfsi standard nearly quadrupled between and from about certifications in february to nearly in december more than two thirds of walmarts company owned food manufacturing facilities are now gfsi certified and the remaining locations are on track to earn certification in the next few years b using technology to enhance food safety and quality in our stores and clubs walmarts food safety program relies on standards for safe food storage and preparation processes that incorporate food safety principles training on our standards and monitoring to verify that the standards are being met the company developed the spark food safety system to make these efforts more efficient and effective spark uses electronic hand held devices to record food temperatures because the results are digital spark allows the company to identify trends and correct issues before they become problems spark also allows instantaneous training to the associates who are using the device for example when an associate is measuring the temperature of a particular food the device can immediately display the correct temperature range to the associate because of sparks proven benefits the company has undertaken a multi year project to install it in our international stores that sell fresh food spark is already installed in the relevant u s walmart and sams club locations there are technical challenges in installing spark internationally but in fy the company installed spark in over additional international locations we intend to continue rolling out spark in our international locations in fy iv shaping the world for good through walmarts supply chain helping people has always been core to walmarts mission and the foundation of our business it not only applies to our customers and associates but also to our suppliers and manufacturers who make the products we sell walmarts supply chain reaches communities throughout the world when handled well that supply chain can provide opportunities for hundreds of thousands of individuals to improve their lives in fy walmart continued to use its purchasing scale to shape the world for good by further enhancing transparency in the supply chain and refreshing how the company conducts supplier audits these efforts are highlighted in additional detail in our global responsibility report walmarts global compliance program report on fiscal year v obtaining the benefits of technology as shown in some of the examples above were increasingly using advanced technologies to make our ethics and compliance program more effective we have implemented a number of new ethics and compliance systems over the past three years and upgraded others investing more than million in this effort in addition to the systems discussed above some of the technologies we are now utilizing include a learning management we conduct an extensive program to train associates on issues relating to ethics and compliance successful training provides our associates the information and skills they need to do their jobs well in fy alone we delivered some form of anticorruption training to more than walmart associates at all levels and provided live instructor led training to more than associates selected based on their roles and likelihood of encountering anticorruption issues while live instructor led training is often our preference the volume of this training program demonstrates the need to use electronic systems to deliver and track training globally with over million associates world wide we are working to leverage technology and increase consistency across our training program in fy we continued rolling out a computer based learning management system in our international markets this system provides a platform for delivering training targeted to specific roles and provides greater accuracy and efficiency in how we track and document our training program we will continue the implementation of this system in additional international markets in fy b global donation management walmarts global donation management system gdms is another example of recent enhancements to our ethics and compliance systems gdms is a web based application we created to manage donations to governments charities and other non governmental organizations gdms has two components a website to manage due diligence registration and approval of potential donation recipients and a store solution to manage approval and accounting for product donations that are made at the store level through the website potential donation recipients can register their organization and submit a funding request which is then routed automatically to our anticorruption due diligence tool discussed above and from there to our internal approval process at the store level associates can use gdms to scan products to be donated to a recipient and the tool will automatically validate that the potential recipient has been approved through our processes while also validating that the product to be donated is appropriate for instance donations of tobacco products are automatically restricted but food water and clothing are permitted walmart has a long history of supporting the needs of our communities in alone walmart and the walmart foundation gave billion in monetary and in kind contributions around the world global in kind donations accounted for approximately billion of that amount while monetary donations of approximately million were given globally additional information on these efforts can be found here gdms facilitates walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year such contributions while also reducing our risk by making the process for reviewing potential donations more efficient walmart implemented gdms in several of our international markets in fy we plan to expand the system to additional markets in the coming year vi looking ahead these examples from fy are part of our larger efforts we are committed to having an ethics and compliance program that is effective sustainable and tailored to our business risks because our business is constantly growing and the world around us is changing we will continue to invest and change in the years ahead as well walmarts global ethics compliance program report on fiscal year
