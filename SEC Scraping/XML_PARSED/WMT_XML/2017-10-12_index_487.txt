securities have been listed for trading or that we have applied for the listing of and admission of those debt securities for trading on a particular securities exchange the laws of the state of new york govern the indenture govern the outstanding debt securities of each series issued under the indenture and will govern any debt securities of a series to be issued under the indenture in the future interest and interest rates general in the applicable prospectus supplement we will designate the debt securities of a series as either bearing interest at a fixed rate of interest or bearing

will bear interest during each relevant interest period at the rate determined as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and as otherwise set forth below each floating rate debt security will have an interest rate basis or formula unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement we will base that formula on the london interbank offered rate or libor for the libor currency the term libor currency means the currency specified in the applicable prospectus supplement as to which libor will be calculated or if no such currency is specified in the applicable prospectus supplement u s dollars in the applicable prospectus supplement we will indicate any spread or spread multiplier to be applied in the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate applicable in any interest period a spread or spread multiplier may cause the interest rate applicable to a particular series of floating rate debt securities to be higher or lower than the applicable libor for a particular interest period interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days during the relevant interest period and a day year the floating rate debt securities may have a maximum or minimum rate limitation in no event however will the rate of interest on the notes be higher than the maximum rate of interest permitted by the laws of the state of new york as those laws may be modified by the federal laws of the united states if any interest payment date for the debt securities of a series bearing interest at a floating rate based on libor other than the maturity date or a tax or other redemption date would otherwise be a day that is not a business day then the interest payment date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day unless that business day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the interest payment date will be the immediately preceding business day if the maturity date of such debt securities or a tax or other redemption date if earlier than the stated maturity date for those debt securities falls on a day which is not a business day then we will make the required payment of principal premium if any and interest or redemption price on the next succeeding business day as if it were made on the date the payment was due interest will not accrue on from or after the stated maturity date or any tax or other redemption date as a result of this delayed payment the calculation agent will reset the rate of interest on the debt securities of a series bearing interest at a floating rate based on libor on each interest payment date if any of the interest reset dates for the debt securities is not a business day that interest reset date will be postponed to the next succeeding business day unless that day is in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the interest reset date will be the immediately preceding business day the interest rate set for the debt securities on a particular interest reset date will remain in effect during the interest period commencing on that interest reset date each interest period will be the period from and including the interest reset date to but excluding the next interest reset date or until the maturity date of the debt securities as the case may be the calculation agent will determine the interest rate applicable to the debt securities bearing interest at a floating rate based on libor on the interest determination date which will be the second london business day immediately preceding the interest reset date the interest rate determined on an interest determination date will become effective on and as of the next interest reset date london business day means any day on which dealings in deposits in the libor currency are transacted in the london interbank market if the debt securities described in the applicable prospectus supplement will bear interest at a floating rate based on libor the calculation agent will determine libor according to the following provisions libor for a particular interest period will be the rate for deposits in the libor currency having the index maturity described in the applicable prospectus supplement commencing on the second london business day immediately following the particular interest determination date that appears on reuters page libor which displays the london interbank offered rates of major banks as of a m london time on that interest determination date for the libor currency the index maturity is the period to maturity of the debt securities with respect to which the related interest rate basis or formula table of contents will be calculated for example the index maturity could be one month three months six months or one year if on a particular interest determination date libor for the applicable index maturity does not appear on reuters page libor at approximately a m london time or if reuters page libor is not available on such date libor for the particular interest period will be the rate for deposits in the libor currency for the applicable index maturity commencing on the second london business day immediately following the particular interest determination date that appears on bloomberg l p s page bbam at such time on such interest determination date if the applicable libor rate cannot be determined by reference to reuters page libor or bloomberg l p s page bbam on an interest determination date as described above then the calculation agent will determine libor as follows the calculation agent will select the principal london offices of four major banks in the london interbank market and request each bank to provide its offered quotation for deposits in the libor currency having the applicable index maturity commencing on the second london business day immediately following the interest determination date to prime banks in the london interbank market at approximately a m london time on the interest determination date those quotes will be for deposits in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in the libor currency in the market at that time but which principal amount shall be no less than million or its then equivalent in the libor currency if the libor currency is other than u s dollars if at least two of those banks provide a quotation the calculation agent will compute libor as the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided if fewer than two of those banks provide a quotation the calculation agent will request from three major banks in new york new york at approximately a m new york city time on the interest determination date quotations for loans having a term equal to the index maturity in libor currency to leading european banks commencing on the second london business day immediately following the interest determination date these quotes will be for loans in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in the market at that time but which principal amount shall be no less than million or its then equivalent in the libor currency if the libor currency is other than u s dollars the calculation agent will compute libor as the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided if none of the banks chosen by the calculation agent provides a quotation as discussed above the rate of interest will be the interest rate in effect

the accuracy of that information furthermore dtc euroclear and clearstream have no obligation to perform or continue to perform the procedures described below and any of them may discontinue or change those procedures at any time dtc dtc has advised us as follows dtc is a limited purpose trust company organized under the new york banking law a banking organization within the meaning of the new york banking law a member of the federal reserve system a clearing corporation within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act dtc holds securities that dtcs participating organizations referred to as direct dtc participants deposit with dtc dtc also facilitates the clearance and post trade settlement among direct dtc participants of sales and other securities transactions such as transfers and pledges in deposited securities through electronic computerized book entry changes in direct dtc participants accounts at dtc thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates direct dtc participants include both u s and non u s securities brokers and dealers including underwriters of our debt securities banks trust companies clearing corporations and certain other organizations some of which and or their representatives indirectly own dtc dtc is a wholly owned subsidiary of the depository trust clearing corporation or dttc which is the holding company for the national securities clearing corporation the fixed income clearing corporation and the emerging markets clearing corporation each of which is a registered clearing organization the users of dttcs regulated subsidiaries services own dttc indirect access to the dtc system is also available to others referred to as indirect dtc participants and together with direct dtc participants referred to as dtc participants such as u s and non u s securities brokers and dealers banks trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct dtc participant either directly or indirectly the rules applicable to dtc and the dtc participants are on file with the sec according to dtc the foregoing information with respect to dtc has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation warranty or contract modification of any kind table of contents beneficial interests in a global note representing our outstanding debt securities and registered in the name of dtc or the nominee of dtc will be shown on and transfers of beneficial interests in the global note will be made only through records maintained by dtc and dtc participants when you purchase such debt securities the purchases must be made by or through a direct dtc participant which will receive credit for the debt securities in its account on dtcs records upon that purchase you will become the beneficial owner of the purchased debt securities if you purchase through a direct dtc participant your interest will be recorded on the records of the direct dtc participant if you purchase through an indirect dtc participant your interest will be recorded on the records of the indirect dtc participant while the direct dtc participant through which the purchase is effected will reflect ownership of those debt securities in the account it maintain maintains for the indirect dtc participant neither dtc nor we will have any knowledge of your individual ownership of the debt securities when you purchase debt securities through the dtc system you will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from dtc you should instead receive these confirmations and account statements from the dtc participant through which you purchase the debt securities the dtc participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers including if you are a customer of such dtc participant any beneficial interests you may hold in our debt securities the trustee and we will treat the person in whose name a global note representing our debt securities is registered whether dtc or its nominee as the owner of such global note for all purposes accordingly the trustee will pay all amounts payable with respect to such debt securities to the registered holder of such global note it is dtcs current practice upon receipt of any payment of distributions or liquidation amounts due on a global note to proportionately credit direct dtc participants accounts on the payment date based on their holdings of the relevant securities payments to you with respect to your beneficial interest in any debt securities in turn will be the responsibility of the dtc participants based on their respective customary practices and the trustee any paying agent and we will have no direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due on a global note to you or any other beneficial owners in that global note we or at our request the trustee will send any redemption notices regarding debt securities directly to dtc which in turn will inform the dtc participants which will then contact you as a beneficial holder dtcs current practice is to pass through any consent or voting rights to the direct dtc participants by using an omnibus proxy those direct dtc participants should in turn solicit votes and consents from you as the ultimate owner of debt securities either directly or through the indirect dtc participant through which you hold the debt securities or provide you with a proxy based on their respective customary practices as a general proposition we understand that under existing industry practices if we request the holders of our debt securities to take or if a beneficial owner of our debt securities wants to take any action that a holder of such debt securities is entitled to take under the indenture dtc would authorize the direct dtc participants holding the relevant beneficial interests in such debt securities to take that action the dtc participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding our debt securities through such dtc participants under applicable rules regulations and procedures dtc must make book entry transfers of our debt securities represented by global notes registered in the name of dtc or its nominee between direct dtc participants and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of premium if any on interest on and the redemption price for such debt securities those dtc participants with which investors have accounts to which such debt securities are credited must make similar book entry transfers and receive and transmit payments on behalf of their respective customers because dtc can only act on behalf of direct dtc participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect dtc participants and certain banks the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a security held in dtc to transfer or pledge that interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or otherwise take actions in respect of that interest may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest the laws of some states of the united states require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form in order to transfer or perfect a security interest in those securities consequently the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a security held in dtc to those persons or to perfect such a security interest may be limited table of contents dtc has advised that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities under the terms and conditions of the debt securities including without limitation the presentation of debt securities for exchange only at the direction of one or more of the direct dtc participants to whose accounts with dtc interests in the relevant debt securities are credited and only in respect of the portion of

different than those discussed below the discussion set forth below also assumes that all debt securities issued under this prospectus constitute debt for u s federal income tax purposes if any debt securities do not constitute debt for u s federal income tax purposes the tax consequences of ownership of such debt securities could differ materially from the tax consequences described below we will summarize any special united states federal tax considerations relevant to a particular issue of the debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements we urge you to consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular u s federal income tax consequences to you and any consequences arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction consequences to united states holders the following is a discussion of the material u s federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a united states holder of debt securities certain consequences to non united states holders of debt securities are described under consequences to non united states holders below table of contents united states holder means a beneficial owner of debt securities that is a citizen or individual resident of the united states a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for u s federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any state of the united states or the district of columbia an estate the income of which is subject to u s federal income taxation regardless of its source or a trust that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the united states and the control of one or more u s persons or has a valid election in effect under applicable u s treasury regulations to be treated as a u s person payments of interest except as described below under original issue discount interest on debt securities that you beneficially own will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes original issue discount if you own debt securities issued with original issue discount oid you will be subject to special tax accounting rules as described in greater detail below in that case you should be aware that you generally must include oid in gross income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income however you generally will not be required to include separately in income cash payments received on the debt securities even if denominated as interest to the extent those payments do not constitute qualified stated interest as defined below if we determine that a particular debt security will be issued with oid an oid debt security we will disclose that determination in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities special rules described below apply to debt securities with a maturity of one year or less and debt securities that are denominated in a currency other than u s dollars foreign currency debt securities a debt security with an issue price that is less than the stated redemption price at maturity the sum of all payments to be made on the debt security other than qualified stated interest generally will be issued with oid if that difference is at least of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity the issue price of each debt security in a particular offering will be the first price at which a substantial amount of that particular offering is sold to the public the term qualified stated interest means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property other than debt instruments of the issuer and the interest to be paid meets all of the following conditions it is payable at least once per year it is payable over the entire term of the debt security and it is payable at a single fixed rate or subject to certain conditions based on one or more interest indices if we determine that particular debt securities of a series will bear interest that is not qualified stated interest we will disclose that determination in the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities if you own a debt security issued with de minimis oid which is discount that is not oid because it is less than of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity you generally must include the de minimis oid in income at the time principal payments on the debt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid any amount of de minimis oid that you have included in income will be treated as capital gain table of contents certain of the debt securities may contain provisions permitting them to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity at our option and or at your option oid debt securities containing those features may be subject to rules that differ from the general rules discussed herein if you are considering the purchase of oid debt securities with those features you should carefully examine the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements and should consult your own tax advisors with respect to those features since the tax consequences to you with respect to oid will depend in part on the particular terms and features of the debt securities if you own oid debt securities with a maturity upon issuance of more than one year you generally must include oid in income in advance of the receipt of some or all of the related cash payments using the constant yield method described in the following paragraphs this method takes into account the compounding of interest the amount of oid that you must include in income if you are the initial united states holder of an oid debt security is the sum of the daily portions of oid with respect to the debt security for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which you held that debt security accrued oid the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the oid allocable to that accrual period the accrual period for an oid debt security may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the debt security provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period the amount of oid allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess if any of the debt securitys adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to maturity determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period over the aggregate of all qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period oid allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity other than a payment of qualified stated interest and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period special rules will apply for calculating oid for an initial short accrual period the adjusted issue price of a debt security at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued oid for each prior accrual period determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition or bond premium as described below and reduced by any payments previously made on the debt security other than a payment of qualified stated interest under these rules you will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of oid in successive accrual periods we are required to provide information returns stating the amount of oid accrued on debt securities held by persons of record other than corporations and other exempt holders floating rate debt securities are subject to special oid rules in the case of an oid debt security that is a floating rate debt security both the yield to maturity and qualified stated interest will be determined solely for purposes of calculating the accrual of oid as though the debt security will bear interest in all periods at a fixed rate generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to interest payments on the debt security on its date of issue or in the case of certain floating rate debt securities the rate that reflects the yield to maturity that is reasonably expected for the debt security additional rules may apply if either the interest on a floating rate debt security is based on more than one interest index or the principal amount of the debt security is indexed in any manner this discussion does not address the tax rules applicable to debt securities with an indexed principal amount or other contingent payments or debt securities that may be convertible into or exchangeable for other securities if you are considering the purchase of floating rate oid debt securities debt securities with indexed principal amounts or other contingent payments or debt securities that may be convertible into or exchangeable for other table of contents securities you should carefully examine the applicable prospectus supplement or supplements relating to those debt securities and should consult your own tax advisors regarding the u s federal income tax consequences to you of holding and disposing of those debt securities you may elect to treat all interest on any debt securities as oid and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above for purposes of this election interest includes stated interest acquisition discount oid de minimis oid market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium you must make this election for the taxable year in which you acquired the debt security and you may not revoke the election without the consent of the internal revenue service the irs if this election were to be made with respect to a debt security with market discount you would be deemed to have made an election to currently include in income market discount with respect to all other debt instruments having market discount that you acquire during the year of the election or thereafter as described below in market discount similarly if you make this election for a debt security that is acquired at a premium you will be deemed to have made an election to amortize bond premium with respect to all debt instruments having amortizable bond premium that you own or acquire during the year of the election or thereafter as described below in acquisition premium and amortizable bond premium you should consult with your own tax advisors about this election short term debt securities in the case of debt securities with a maturity upon issuance of one year or less short term debt securities all payments including all stated interest will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity and will not be qualified stated interest as a result you will generally be taxed on the discount instead of stated interest the discount will be equal to the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity over the issue price of a short term debt security unless you elect to compute this discount using tax basis instead of issue price in general individuals and certain other cash method united states holders of short term debt securities are not required to include accrued discount in their income currently unless they elect to do so but may be required to include stated interest in income as the income is received united states holders that report income for u s federal income tax purposes on the accrual method and certain other united states holders are required to accrue discount on short term debt securities as ordinary income on a straight line basis unless an election is made to accrue the discount according to a constant yield method based on daily compounding if you are not required and do not elect to include discount in income currently any gain you realize on the sale exchange or retirement of a short term debt security will generally be ordinary income to you to the extent of the discount accrued by you through the date of the sale exchange or retirement in addition if you are not required and do not elect to include discount in income currently you may be required to defer deductions for a portion of your interest expense with respect to any indebtedness attributable to the short term debt securities market discount if you purchase debt securities other than oid debt securities for an amount that is less than their stated redemption price at maturity or in the case of oid debt securities their adjusted issue price the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for u s federal income tax purposes unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount under the market discount rules you will be required to treat any principal payment on or any gain on the sale exchange retirement or other disposition of the debt securities as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that you have not previously included in income and are treated as having accrued on the debt securities at the time of the payment or disposition in addition you may be required to defer until the maturity of the debt securities or their earlier disposition in a taxable transaction the deduction of all or a portion of the interest expense on any indebtedness attributable to the debt securities you may elect on a debt security by debt security basis to deduct the deferred interest expense in a tax year prior to the year of disposition you should consult your own tax advisors before making this election any market discount will be considered to accrue ratably during the period from the date of acquisition to the maturity date of the debt securities unless you elect to accrue on a constant interest method you may elect to table of contents include market discount in income currently as it accrues on either a ratable or constant interest method in which case the rule described above regarding deferral of interest deductions will not apply your election to include market discount in income currently once made applies to all market discount obligations acquired by you on or after the first taxable year to which your election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs you should consult your own tax advisor before making this election acquisition premium and amortizable bond premium if you purchase oid debt securities for an amount that is greater than their adjusted issue price but equal to or less than the sum of all amounts payable on the debt securities after the purchase date other

include in gross income with respect to those debt securities for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of the acquisition premium properly allocable to that year if you purchase debt securities including oid debt securities for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on those debt securities after the purchase date other than qualified stated interest you will be considered to have purchased those debt securities at a premium and if they are oid debt securities you will not be required to include any oid in income you generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of those debt securities on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under your regular accounting method in the case of debt

exercise or not exercise options in a manner that minimizes your yield except that we will be assumed to exercise call options in a manner that maximizes your yield if you do not elect to amortize bond premium that premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss you would otherwise recognize on disposition of the debt security your election to amortize premium on a constant yield method

with revised terms if this is the case you would realize gain or loss equal to the difference between the issue price of the new debt securities and your tax basis in the old debt securities although in certain circumstances such a deemed exchange may qualify as a tax free recapitalization if the exercise of the option is not treated as an exchange of old debt securities for new debt securities

translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into u s dollars you will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment if you use the accrual method of accounting you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods under the first method you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the u s dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued under the second method you may elect to translate

extent of the difference between the u s dollar value of the accrued oid determined in the same manner as for accrued interest and the u s dollar value of such payment determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the date such payment is received for these purposes all receipts on a debt security will be viewed first as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the debt security second as receipts of previously accrued oid to the extent thereof with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first and third as the receipt of principal table of contents market discount and bond premium the amount of market discount on foreign currency debt securities includible in income will generally be determined by translating the market discount determined in the foreign currency into u s dollars at the spot rate on the date the foreign currency debt securities are retired or otherwise disposed of if you have elected to accrue market discount currently then the amount which accrues is determined in the foreign currency and then translated into u s dollars on the basis of the average exchange rate in effect during such accrual period you will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to market discount which is accrued currently using the approach applicable to the accrual of interest income as described above bond premium on foreign currency debt securities will be computed in the applicable foreign currency if you have elected to amortize the premium the amortizable bond premium will reduce interest income in the applicable foreign currency at the time bond premium is amortized exchange gain or loss which is generally ordinary gain or loss will be realized based on the difference between spot rates at such time and the time of acquisition of the foreign currency debt securities if you elect not to amortize bond premium you must translate the bond premium computed in the foreign currency into u s dollars at the spot rate on the maturity date and such bond premium will constitute a capital loss which may be offset or eliminated by exchange gain sale exchange or retirement upon the sale exchange retirement or other taxable disposition of foreign currency debt securities you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the
