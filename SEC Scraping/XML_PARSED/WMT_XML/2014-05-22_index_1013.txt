please execute and return your proxy card according to wal mart stores inc s instructions may dear wal mart shareholder at wal marts june annual meeting shareholders will have an opportunity to vote on proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay which asks wal mart to report annually whether it clawed back pay from senior executives in the previous year and to describe the general circumstances of any recovery we believe that disclosure would improve accountability to shareholders and enhance the effectiveness of wal marts clawback policy and we urge you to vote for the proposal we are five institutional investors holding over million shares of wal mart common stock we offer the following points for your consideration disclosure of misconduct based incentive pay recovery takes on additional urgency at wal mart in our view because wal mart has been embroiled in several recent controversies the u s doj and sec are investigating whether wal mart violated us anticorruption laws by bribing foreign officials in mexico and wal marts own anticorruption probe has broadened to include operations in india china and brazil these ongoing investigations already have cost the company million wal mart is among the companies that are facing intense scrutiny following a series of building collapses and fires in bangladeshi and pakistani garment factories wal mart has confirmed that some of its clothing was produced in the tazreen fashions factorywhere bangladeshi garment workers were killed in a fireby one of its vendors using an unauthorized subcontractor in may wal mart pled guilty to federal criminal charges and paid over million in civil fines for illegally dumping hazardous waste in california and missouri the national labor relations board nlrb in january issued a complaint against wal mart alleging the company illegally threatened surveilled and terminated u s workers who initiated strikes and protests urging better pay and improved working conditions wal marts existing clawback policy does not require disclosure of decisions to claw back pay and sec rules only require disclosure of pay adjustments for named executive officers neos in our view broader disclosure would foster a corporate culture of compliance and ethical conduct by educating employees about behavioral expectations setting the tone at the top and deter future compliance violations increase accountability to shareholders and other stakeholders by informing them about the application of the clawback policy and promote better alignment between pay and performance by recovering compensation from wrongdoers whose conduct damaged wal mart may page of proposal no balances the need for greater transparency around clawbacks and the important role the compensation nominating and governance committee the committee has in setting executive pay accordingly the recoupment disclosure policy we seek would not require wal mart to claw back pay in any particular circumstance but does ensure that decisions regarding recovery from senior executives under wal marts existing plans and agreements are disclosed would give the committee flexibility to determine the level of detail it provides in the report taking into account privacy and legal concerns is consistent with the practices of other large multinational corporations including northrop grumman mckesson omnicare united technologies and halliburton and disclosures similar to those we are seeking have begun to appear in proxy statements wal mart arguesin its statement in opposition to our proposal that the disclosure required under sec rules is sufficient we disagree we believe that the disclosure of clawbacks for a handful of individuals is inadequate for a company with million employees and multiple business units and subsidiaries located around the globe incentives for senior executives below the neo level we think are particularly important in establishing a culture of compliance and deterring violations given the more hands on role such executives play major compliance failures at walmart may be costly both in terms of the direct costs of investigations and penalties as well as the indirect costs of damaged brand reputation increased regulatory scrutiny and the erection of potential barriers to operating in certain markets accordingly we believe shareholders have a compelling interest in monitoring the committees decisions regarding clawbacks for misconduct we therefore urge you to vote for proposal no sincerely uaw retiree medical benefits
