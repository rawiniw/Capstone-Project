securities and exchange commission the commission contained in that letter and have provided our response in regular type following each comment form k for the fiscal year ended january exhibit item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations page please expand your disclosure to explain the impact on your effective income tax rates and obligations of having earnings in countries where you have lower statutory tax rates as well as the relationship between the foreign and domestic effective tax rates given the continued growth in your international operations it appears that a separate discussion of foreign effective income tax rates would provide more transparency in understanding your results of operations we refer you to item a i of regulation s k and section iii b of sec release letter to the securities and exchange commission june page our international pre tax earnings approximated billion or of consolidated earnings in fiscal while international earnings are generated in tax jurisdictions with various applicable statutory tax rates more than of our international pre tax earnings were generated in countries where the statutory income tax rates range from to we advise in our mda disclosure under the caption results of operations on page of exhibit to our annual report to shareholders on form k for fiscal year exhibit that our annual effective tax rates may be impacted by the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations additionally there has not been significant historical volatility in our annual effective tax rates which ranged from to during the last six fiscal years we disclose the relationship between domestic and foreign pre tax earnings and their respective impact to the effective tax rates in our disclosure in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of exhibit specifically we disclose the separate amounts of our domestic and foreign pre tax earnings and our provisions for u s federal state and local income taxes and foreign income taxes we believe that it is clearly discernable to the user that our foreign effective tax rate is lower than our domestic rate and that as foreign pre tax earnings increase as a percentage of the total pre tax earnings our overall effective tax rate will likely decrease assuming everything else being constant accordingly we do not believe expanded disclosure is required although if significant volatility in our effective tax rate were to occur in the future then appropriate disclosure of that fact and the primary causes of the volatility of the effective tax rate would be described in our periodic filings liquidity and capital resources page please tell us what consideration you gave to providing a discussion of the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the associated potential tax impact we refer you to item a of regulation s k and section iv of sec release we have disclosed our intention to use cash flows from operations to fund our global expansion activities including increasing international retail square footage and pending business acquisitions as noted on page of exhibit under the caption liquidity and capital resources in our mda we may deploy a portion of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries toward these global activities and therefore such amounts will not be repatriated to the united states we do not believe that these matters have required or will require discussion in our mda because we intend to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries as noted in our disclosure in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of exhibit cash flows from operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity which in conjunction with long term debt and short term borrowings funds our operations inside and letter to the securities and exchange commission june page outside of the u s as well any new global expansion activities without the need to repatriate significant undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets have historically provided us with substantial sources of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past and strong credit rating item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies page please advise us if cash held in your foreign subsidiaries is freely transferable to the u s if not and the restricted funds held in another country are significant in proportion to your consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounts please disclose the amounts not freely transferable in your notes to the financial statements we refer you to rule of regulation s x please note that we would consider funds restricted due to adverse tax consequences of repatriation to be restricted cash cash held in our foreign subsidiaries is freely transferable to the u s except in jurisdictions where we are subject to remittance restrictions imposed by certain foreign governments and where we may be subject to u s tax upon transfer cash subject to remittance restrictions in foreign jurisdictions may fluctuate and did not represent a material amount of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at january or we do not believe adverse tax consequences exist that restrict our use of our cash and cash equivalents in a material manner in future annual filings if the portion of our cash and cash equivalents as of any balance sheet date that is subject to remittance restrictions in foreign jurisdictions is material to consolidated cash and cash equivalents or adverse tax consequences exist that restrict our use of cash and cash equivalents in a material manner we will provide appropriate disclosure regarding that matter revenue recognition page tell us and disclose if your shopping gift cards have expiration dates if not tell us and disclose your policy in recognizing gift cards or prepaid cards that are never redeemed including how you estimate such breakage if you have no policy for recognition of prepaid or gift cards that expire or are never redeemed please explain the reason s for lack of a policy in this regard we note the popularity of wal marts money card our shopping cards gift cards shopping card s in the u s do not carry an expiration date and therefore customers and members can redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely however our shopping cards in certain foreign countries where we do business may have expiration dates we will disclose these facts in future annual filings letter to the securities and exchange commission june page we have an accounting policy with respect to recognizing revenue related to shopping cards that are never redeemed we estimate breakage on unredeemed shopping cards based on historical usage of shopping cards and recognize the breakage as revenue over the historical usage period we review these estimates periodically and update our estimates if necessary we have not disclosed our accounting policy for recognizing shopping card breakage because the amounts involved are not material historically approximately of funds initially established or added to an individual shopping card are never redeemed as a result shopping card breakage recorded as revenue historically has been insignificant note accrued liabilities page we note that you consider the policies and estimates applicable to self insurance reserves to be among your critical accounting policies and estimates please revise the notes to your financial statements to provide a table showing the year end balances of the reserve and the additions subtractions and adjustments

we will provide a table showing a roll forward of self insurance reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements in future annual reports on form k subject to our determination of self insurance continuing to be a critical accounting policy of the company our disclosures regarding critical accounting estimates under the caption self insurance states liabilities associated with any claims are estimated by considering historical claims experience including frequency severity demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions this includes both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims in future annual reports on form k we will explicitly disclose that incurred but not reported claims are considered in the companys estimates we maintain stop loss insurance coverage for workers compensation and general liability of million and million respectively per occurrence to limit our exposure to certain risks we will disclose this stop loss coverage in future annual reports on form k when our assumptions with respect to self insurance reserves change significantly we include appropriate disclosure for example we disclosed a million change in estimate with respect to general letter to the securities and exchange commission june page liability and workers compensation claims during fiscal year in future periodic reports we will add comments regarding any material risks that could impact the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions in the future we confirm that when we have or expect to have significant adjustments in the future we will provide the necessary disclosures note income taxes page you state that a provision has not been made for u s taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of your international subsidiaries of approximately billion as of january because you intend to reinvest these earnings permanently outside of the u s please tell us how you believe your policy complies with asc in this regard please also address your repatriation of earnings in each of the last three fiscal years in accordance with asc if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely no income taxes shall be accrued our assertion that we will and our intent to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign undistributed earnings is based on our plan that those non u s earnings will be used to fund our operations in the markets where the funds are generated and our global expansion efforts additionally as described in comment no cash flows from operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity which in conjunction with long term debt and short term borrowings funds our operations inside and outside of the u s as well as any new global expansion activities without the need to repatriate significant undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries over the past three years the following amounts of foreign earnings have been repatriated to the u s primarily by deemed inclusions under the u s tax code and to a lesser extent by cash distributions year ended inmillions the related tax impacts have been properly recorded in the year of those distributions and are disclosed in the effective tax rate reconciliation table in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of exhibit letter to the securities and exchange commission june page note legal proceedings page it appears that your disclosure regarding braun hummel v wal mart stores inc is outdated please provide us with proposed disclosure expanding your description to include material events that have occurred after the filing of your notice of appeal on december with regard to braun hummel v wal mart stores inc the braun proceeding we believe that the disclosure set forth in the companys previous filings included an appropriate description of all of the material events in the litigation as you point out there had been no change in the description of the braun proceeding for the past several quarters however the matter has been pending on appeal and as of june when our first quarter form q was filed with the commission the first quarter form q no material events had occurred during that time however to update the disclosure the company included additional information regarding the appellate briefs and oral argument in front of the superior court of appeals in the first quarter form q on june the pennsylvania superior court of appeals upheld the trial courts certification of a class of current and former hourly associates who worked in pennsylvania the superior court of appeals upheld the jurys award of million in damages for missed meal breaks and off the clock work as well as statutory penalties but reversed the trial courts award of attorney fees with that matter being remanded back to the trial court for a downward adjustment the company intends to file a petition with the supreme court of pennsylvania to review the trial courts decision the disclosure regarding the braun proceeding that appears in future periodic filings with the commission beginning with the companys form q for the second quarter of fiscal the second quarter form q will be as reflected in the response to comment no below we further note that a final judgment in the approximate amount of million was entered in in this regard it appears you may have recorded an accrual as all of the criteria in fasb asc have been met however you have not disclosed the amount of the accrual nor is there disclosure indicating that there is an exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued please revise to disclose what the additional loss may be for this matter or an aggregate estimate which includes other matters where an accrual has been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and reasonably estimable but an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amounts accrued and no accrual has been made because a loss although estimable is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable please include all of disclosures as required by paragraphs of fasb asc letter to the securities and exchange commission june page we believe the disclosure set forth in note to the financial statements regarding the braun proceeding complies with the disclosure requirements set forth in paragraphs and of fasb asc as applicable in this regard we note that as to the braun proceeding note discloses i the contingency represented by the braun proceeding and the trial courts judgment as required by paragraph of fasb asc ii the nature of the contingency and the possible loss in the matter i e the braun proceeding the trial courts judgment therein and the amount awarded by that judgment as required by paragraph of fasb asc and iii the amount of the possible loss contingency represented by the braun proceeding as contemplated in the last sentence of paragraph of fasb asc with regard to the possibility of additional loss please be advised that the company currently foresees no additional potential losses in excess of the amount of possible loss already disclosed in note in connection with the braun proceeding other than the accrual of post judgment interest on the judgment during the pendency of the appeal by operation of law post judgment interest accrues at the rate of six percent per annum on the amount of the judgment from november until the date the judgment is paid unless of course the judgment is reversed or set aside on appeal in which event any liability for such interest is extinguished along with the principal amount of the judgment it does not appear that the accumulation of post judgment interest at this rate constitutes a material event nevertheless in response to your comment the company included language in the first quarter form q regarding post judgment interest therefore as amended in response to comments nos and and in light of the recent ruling by the superior court of appeals the companys disclosure regarding the braun proceeding absent any further developments beginning with the second quarter form q as supplemented will read as follows wage and hour class action the company is a defendant in braun hummel v wal mart stores inc a class action lawsuit commenced in march in the court of common pleas in philadelphia pennsylvania the plaintiffs alleged that the company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented class members from taking their full meal and rest breaks on october a jury awarded back pay damages to the plaintiffs of

final judgment in the approximate amount of million which included the jurys back pay award plus statutory penalties prejudgment interest and attorneys fees by operation of law post judgment interest accrues on the judgment amount at the rate of six percent per annum from the date of entry of the judgment which was letter to the securities and exchange commission june page november until the judgment is paid unless the judgment is revised or set aside on appeal on december the company filed its notice of appeal the company filed its opening appellate brief on february plaintiffs filed their response brief on april and the company filed its reply brief on june oral argument was held before the superior court of appeals on august on june the superior court of appeals upheld the trial courts certification of the class the jurys back pay award the statutory penalties and prejudgment interest the superior court of appeals reversed the trial courts award of attorneys fees and remanded the fee award back to the trial court for a downward adjustment the company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to the claims at issue and filed a petition for review of the trial courts decision with the pennsylvania supreme court on july finally please be advised that the company does not set forth accrual information on a case by case basis in its public filings we believe our disclosures comply with fasb asc with regard to litigation matters in particular the company believes that public disclosure of such information could compromise the companys applicable legal privileges impair its ability to conduct effective settlement negotiations and otherwise negatively impact its defenses the decision whether or not to establish an accrual in connection with the braun proceeding has been evaluated under appropriate fasb standards and based upon advice of counsel as also indicated in note which states that t he company has made accruals with respect to these matters where appropriate which are reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements exhibit the consent lacks evidence of a signature by the independent registered public accounting firm as required by item b ii of regulation s k see also item of regulation s t for requirements regarding signatures in electronic submissions please confirm whether your auditor provided a manually signed consent as of march and if so supplementary provide us with a copy of the consent please also confirm that all future consents will include a conformed signature as appropriate our auditor provided a

were our specific performance targets for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to these targets page letter to the securities and exchange commission june page please provide us with proposed disclosure expanding your discussion of diversity goals in the first paragraph on page to disclose the specific placement goals and good faith efforts goals for each of your named executive officers

fiscal participation in two diversity events will be required the placement component of this program generally applies only to managers who have responsibility for our walmart us and sams club field operations during fiscal two of our named executive officers mr duke and mr simon were subject to placement objectives the determination as to whether each of these named executive officers satisfies his or her placement objectives is based on both a qualitative and quantitative review of the named executive officers respective diversity efforts during the fiscal year the factors considered in this review include a the relative number of placements of diverse candidates in specified positions within the named executive officers organization during the fiscal year b the named executive officers engagement and participation in developing and implementing diversity and inclusion strategies c the named executive officers leadership efforts and commitment to our diversity and inclusion efforts and d the named executive officers efforts in recruiting diverse candidates and developing diverse associates because the determination as to whether a named executive officer has satisfied his or her diversity goals is not strictly quantitative and includes elements of subjectivity we have structured the diversity goals component of our cash incentive plan as a potential discretionary reduction of each named executive officers cash incentive in order to preserve the deductibility of the cash incentive payment as performance based under section m of the internal revenue code of as amended we believe that information relating to the specific good faith efforts and placement components of our diversity goals program is not material to an understanding of our executive

recruiting and developing diverse associates applying these factors at the end of each fiscal year our chief diversity officer reviews each neos performance under our diversity program and reports the
