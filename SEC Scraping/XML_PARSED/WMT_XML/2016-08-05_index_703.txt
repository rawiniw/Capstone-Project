consideration of expanding the description of your leasing arrangements to explain how a noncash gain was determined and your accounting for the gain please provide us with references to the authoritative guidance supporting your accounting when we are deemed the owner of leased assets pursuant to asc leases asc due to the nature of our involvement in the construction of those leased assets we apply a financing lease model to account for such failed sale leaseback transactions our financing lease model is based on our review and interpretation of the guidance in asc sale leaseback transactions additionally we referred to guidance in asc for bifurcation of real estate leases for classification purposes in asc for adoption of depreciation methods and in asc for the effective interest method the application of the financing lease model was made on a lease by lease basis considering the specific provisions of each arrangement under the financing lease model the financing lease asset and financing obligation often amortize independently from one another as the asset is amortized on a straight line basis while the obligation is amortized using the effective interest method additionally a portion of each lease payment is allocated as implied land rental cost which is reflected within the operating lease column in our minimum lease payment table with the remaining amount of the lease payment used to service the debt i e interest expense is recognized and a reduction to the financing lease obligation is recorded using the effective interest method in certain circumstances the portion of the lease payment allocated to servicing the debt is insufficient to extinguish the financing obligation by the end of the lease term thus any excess of the net remaining financing obligation compared to the net carrying value of the leased asset would result in a noncash gain upon the termination of such leases under the heading leases in note page of exhibit to our k portions of our annual report to shareholders for the year ended january we included discussion of our lease policy pertaining to our involvement in the construction of our stores in future filings we will update that portion of our accounting policy shown below to include the underlined sentence the company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores in certain cases payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor s construction of the leased assets result in the company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes as a result regardless of the significance of the payments accounting standards codification leases asc defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the company to capitalize the lessor s total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation upon completion of the lessor s project the company performs a sale leaseback analysis pursuant to asc to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the company s consolidated balance sheets if the company is deemed to have continuing involvement the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term upon termination of a financing lease any net remaining financing obligation in excess of the net carrying value of the related financing lease asset will be recognized as a noncash gain note acquisitions disposals and related items page please tell us what consideration you gave to providing a separate schedule showing the effects of changes in the parent s ownership interest in subsidiaries on the equity attributable to the parent please refer to paragraph d of asc a we
