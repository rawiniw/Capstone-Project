factors to continue to weigh on our outlook said holley some of the factors affecting our consumers include reductions in government benefits higher taxes and tighter credit further we have higher group health care costs in the u s these concerns combined with investments in e commerce will make it difficult to achieve the goal we have of growing operating income at the same or faster rate than sales in october we forecasted a to percent net sales increase for fiscal given these factors and the ongoing headwind from currency exchange we expect to be toward the low end of the net sales

reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies calculation of return on investment and return on assetsmanagement believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percentand percentfor the fiscal years ended jan and respectively roi was impacted by a decrease in operating income as well as investments in fixed assets and the impact from acquisitions we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assetsfiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominatoraverage total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assetsnumeratorincome from continuing operations denominatoraverage total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of january certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billionand billionfor the fiscal years endedjan and respectively timing of tax payments as well as slightly higher capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the reduction free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities fiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for net sales and operating income for the three months and fiscal year ended jan three months ended january

fluctuations net sales from acquisitions constant currency net sales operating income as reported currency exchange rate fluctuations operating loss from acquisitions constant currency operating income excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations related to acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods underlying epsthe underlying diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart underlying eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because the underlying eps for each such period includes certain amounts not included in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan management believes that the underlying eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for each of such periods for certain items recorded in the three months and fiscal year ended jan is the metric that best compares with the eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan respectively in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for each of such periods when compared to walmart s earnings performance for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan respectively we have calculated the underlying eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan by adjusting the eps for each period for the amount of the dilutive impact of brazil non income tax contingencies brazil taxes brazil employment claim contingencies brazil employment matters the closure of underperforming brazil and china stores store closures china store lease expense charges lease matters the india transaction india transaction and sam s club u s staff restructuring and club closure sam s restructuring underlying eps for the three months and the
