measurements the company records and discloses certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities at their fair value the fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction a liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and level unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring the company to develop its own assumptions the disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at cost is as follows cash and cash equivalents the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments short term debt the carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments long term debt the fair value is based on the companys current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements or where applicable quoted market prices the carrying value and fair value of the companys long term debt as of april and january are as follows carrying value carrying value carrying value carrying value april january amounts in millions carryingvalue fairvalue carryingvalue fairvalue long term debt including amounts due within one year additionally as of april and january the company held certain derivative asset and liability positions that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis the majority of the companys derivative instruments relate to interest rate swaps the fair values of these interest rate swaps have been measured in accordance with level inputs of the fair value hierarchy using the income approach as of april and january the notional amounts and fair values of these interest rate swaps are as follows asset liability april january amounts in millions notionalamount fairvalue notionalamount fairvalue receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges receive floating rate pay fixed rate interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges total the fair values above are the estimated amounts the company would receive or pay upon a termination of the agreements relating to such instruments as of the reporting dates note derivative financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty if their derivative liability position exceeds certain thresholds the companys transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held million in cash collateral from these counterparties at april it is the companys policy to record cash collateral exclusive of any derivative asset and any collateral holdings are reflected in its accrued liabilities as amounts due to the counterparties furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral if the derivative liability position exceeds million the company has no outstanding collateral postings and in the event of providing cash collateral the company would record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks the contract terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings during the period instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change fair value instruments the company is party to receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating rate interest and receives fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the instruments the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the companys exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the instruments being hedged the derivative instruments were assumed to be perfectly effective hedges and all changes in the fair value of the hedges were recorded in long term debt and accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the condensed consolidated balance sheets with no net impact on the condensed consolidated statements of income these fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from april to may net investment instruments the company is party to cross currency interest rate swaps that hedge its net investment in the united kingdom the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed rate payments in one currency for fixed rate payments in another currency all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated

other comprehensive income loss offsetting the currency translation adjustment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss these instruments will mature on dates ranging from may to january cash flow instruments the company is party to receive floating rate pay fixed rate interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain non u s denominated debt the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk changes in the non u s benchmark interest rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings to offset the floating rate interest expense these cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from august to july the company is also party to receive fixed rate pay fixed rate cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non u s denominated debt the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non u s denominated debt changes in the currency exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings to offset the re measurement gain or loss on the non u s denominated debt these cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from september to march any ineffectiveness related to these instruments has been and is expected to be immaterial to the companys financial condition or results of operations financial statement presentation hedging instruments with an unrealized gain are

number of legal proceedings the company has made accruals with respect to these matters where appropriate which are reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements for some matters the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore accruals have not been made however where a liability is reasonably possible and material such matters have been disclosed the company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the companys shareholders the matters or groups of related matters discussed below if decided adversely to or settled by the company individually or in the aggregate unless stated otherwise may result in

and issued a revised opinion as a result the companys petition for rehearing en banc was denied as moot the company filed a new petition for rehearing en banc on january on february the court of appeals issued an order granting the petition on april the ninth circuit issued a divided opinion affirming certain portions of the district courts ruling and reversing other portions on august the company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court seeking review of the ninth circuits decision on december the supreme court granted the companys petition for writ of certiorari the company filed its brief for petitioner on january the brief for respondents was filed on february and oral argument was held on march if the company is not successful in its appeal of class certification or an appellate court issues a ruling that allows for the certification of a class or classes with a different size or scope and if there is a subsequent adverse verdict on the merits from which there is no successful appeal or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the litigation the resulting liability could be material to the companys financial condition or results of operations the plaintiffs also seek punitive damages which if awarded could result in the payment of additional amounts material to the companys financial condition or results of operations however because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the appeal because of the uncertainty of the balance of the proceedings contemplated by the district court and because the companys liability if any arising from the litigation including the size of any damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in the litigation or any negotiated settlement could vary widely the company cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from the litigation hazardous materials investigations on november the company received a grand jury subpoena from the united states

disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste the company has been informed by the u s attorneys office for the central district of california that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the clean water act and the hazardous materials transportation statute this u s attorneys office contends among other things that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because those materials may be considered hazardous waste the government alleges that to comply with rcra the company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier the u s attorneys office in the northern district of california subsequently joined in this investigation the company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition including disposal by certified facilities is compliant with applicable laws and regulations while management cannot

internationally we operate with similar philosophies our fiscal year ends on january for our u s and canada operations and on december for all other operations this discussion relates to walmart and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements as of april and for the three month period then ended and the accompanying notes included in part i item of this quarterly report on form q as well as our consolidated financial statements as of january and for the year then ended and the accompanying notes and the related managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations both of which are contained in our annual report to shareholders for the year ended january and incorporated by reference in and included as an exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended january we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess our performance the discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company as a whole our operations comprise three reportable segments the walmart u s segment the walmart international segment and the sams club segment the walmart u s segment includes the companys mass merchant concept in the united states and puerto rico operating primarily under the walmart or wal mart brands as well as walmart com the walmart international segment consists of the companys operations outside of the united states and puerto rico the sams club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the united states and puerto rico as well as samsclub com throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we discuss segment operating income and comparable store and club sales the company measures the results of its segments using among other measures each segments operating income including certain corporate overhead allocations from time to time we revise the measurement of each segments operating income including any corporate overhead allocations as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker when we do so the prior period amounts for segment operating income are reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation the amounts under the caption other in the table below relating to operating income are primarily unallocated corporate overhead items comparable store and club sales is a measure of the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs that reflects the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year walmarts definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations and expansions changes in format continue to be excluded from comparable store sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in square footage of more than five percent comparable store sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussions of our consolidated results and the operating results of our walmart international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to convert the walmart international segments operating results from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not denominated in the u s dollar company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the companys priority of growth focuses on sales through comparable store or club sales and unit square footage growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys objective to increase its operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing its operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of its net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company manages working capital through free cash flow growth net sales three months ended april dollar amounts in millions net sales percentoftotal percentchange net sales percentoftotal walmart u s walmart international sams club net sales our consolidated net sales increased for the three months ended april when compared to the three months ended april the increase in net sales is primarily due to our continued expansion activities as we grew retail square feet by during the trailing months ended april sams clubs net sales increased as a result of strong comp sales currency exchange rate fluctuations related to walmart international operations accounted for billion of the increase in net sales volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the

of our operating expenses to the growth of our net sales and comparing the growth of our operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful measures as they indicate how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at a faster rate than net sales operating expenses for the three months ended april operating expenses increased when compared to the same period in the prior year while net sales increased over the same periods first quarter operating expenses included a million currency exchange rate impact our focus on ensuring every day low cost remains a priority throughout the company operating income our operating income grew by for the three months ended april when compared to the same periods in the prior year while net sales increased by over net sales in the same prior year period operating income for the three months ended april included a million currency benefit returns return on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was percent and percent for the trailing month periods ended april and respectively the primary drivers of the change in roi were the impact from currency exchange and cash held for pending acquisitions we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows forthetwelvemonthsendedapril dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of april certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of

discontinued operations total assets as of april and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period negative free cash flow was billion at april due to our increased investment in inventory and timing of payments for accrued liabilities compared to billion for the three months ended april free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities

increase in net sales resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the companys net sales in the future our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit margin for the three months ended april decreased basis points when compared to the same period in the prior year driven by walmart internationals shift in sales

effective income tax rate was and for the three months ended april and respectively we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be approximately to significant factors that may impact our effective tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than

exchange rates may continue to affect the walmart international segment in the future gross profit margin decreased by basis points for the three months ended april compared to the same period in the

the membership increased basis points when compared to the same period last year liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity we use these cash flows supplemented with long term debt and short term borrowings to fund our operations and global expansion activities generally some or all of the remaining free cash flow if any funds all or part of the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases threemonthsendedapril amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were billion and billion for the three months ended april and respectively the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended april from the prior year period was primarily related to the timing of accrued liabilities and an increase in accounts receivable cash equivalents and working capital cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion at april and respectively our working capital deficits were billion and billion at april and respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payments of dividends cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of payments for property and equipment which were billion and billion during the three months ended april and respectively these capital expenditures primarily relate to new store growth as well as remodeling costs for existing stores we expect capital expenditures for our fiscal year ending january to range between billion and billion excluding acquisitions cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short and long term debt as well as dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock short term borrowings during the three months ended april we increased our net short term borrowings by billion as compared to an increase of billion during the same period in the prior year from time to time we utilize the liquidity under our short term borrowing programs to fund our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and for other cash requirements and corporate purposes on an as needed basis long term debt proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were billion and billion for the three months ended april and respectively the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were used to pay down or refinance existing debt and for other general corporate purposes information on new long term debt issuances during the first quarter of fiscal is as follows amounts in millions principal issue date maturitydate interestrate amount april april april april april april april april total issuances the notes of each series require semi annual interest payments on april and october of each year commencing on october unless previously purchased and cancelled the company will repay the notes of each series at of their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at their maturity the notes of each series are senior unsecured obligations of the company dividends on march the companys board of directors declared an annual dividend for fiscal of per share an increase of over the per share dividends paid in fiscal for the fiscal year ending january the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments according to the following record and payable dates record date payable date march april may june august september december january the dividend installment payable on april was paid as scheduled company share repurchase program from time to time we have repurchased shares of our common stock under a billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on june and announced on june on june the companys board of directors replaced that share repurchase program which had approximately billion of remaining authorization for share repurchase as of that date with a new billion share repurchase program announced on june as a result we have terminated and will make no further share repurchases under the program announced on june as was the case with the replaced share repurchase program the new program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased billion of our shares under the newly authorized program or we earlier terminate or replace the newly authorized program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status we spent approximately billion and billion for share repurchases during the first quarters of fiscal years and respectively we consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things our current cash needs our capacity for leverage our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock capital resources management believes cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets has historically provided us with substantial sources of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness continuing to be at or above the level of our current ratings at april the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long term debt were as follows rating agency commercialpaper long termdebt standard poors a aa moodys investors service p aa fitch ratings f aa dbrs limited r middle aa in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or any rated series of our outstanding long term debt issues were lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of the companys long term debt securities were lower than those noted above our ability to access the debt markets would be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt i e the rate of interest on any such indebtedness would be higher than our cost of funds had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings long term debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases total capitalization is defined as debt plus total walmart shareholders equity we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long term financing decisions at april and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased during the three months ended april as a result of an increase in our long term debt coupled with a decline in shareholders equity primarily as a result of the amounts expended for cash dividends and share repurchases over the trailing twelve months ended april item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates our market risks at april are similar to those disclosed in our form k for the year ended january the information concerning market risk under the sub caption market risk of the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra the clean water act and the hazardous materials transportation statute this u s attorney s office contends among other things that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the company s stores to its return centers is prohibited by rcra because
