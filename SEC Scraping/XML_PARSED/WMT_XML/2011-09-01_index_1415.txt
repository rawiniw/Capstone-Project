such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty if their derivative liability position exceeds certain thresholds the companys transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held million in cash collateral from these counterparties at

providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings during the period instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge

floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating rate interest and receives fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the instruments the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the companys exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the instruments being hedged the derivative instruments were assumed to be perfectly effective hedges and all changes in the fair value of the hedges were recorded in long

this quarterly report on form q as well as our consolidated financial statements as of january and the related managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations both are contained in our annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended january and incorporated by reference in and included as an exhibit to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes we also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess our performance the discussion also

operating income including any corporate overhead allocations as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our codm when we do so the prior period amounts for segment operating income are reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation the amounts representing other in the leverage discussion of the companys performance metrics are primarily unallocated corporate overhead items comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing u s stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding period in the prior year walmarts definition of comparable store and club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous months including remodels relocations and expansions changes in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in square feet of more than five percent comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing the consolidated and operating results of our walmart international segment we sometimes refer to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to convert the walmart international segments operating results from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not denominated in the u s dollar table of contents company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns the companys priority of growth focuses on sales through comparable store or club sales and unit square feet growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys objective to increase its operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing its operating selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses at a slower rate than the growth of its net sales and the priority of returns focuses on how efficiently the company employs its assets through return on investment roi and how effectively the company manages working capital through free cash flow growth net sales three

operating income to the growth of our net sales are meaningful measures as they indicate how effectively we manage costs and leverage operating expenses our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than net sales and to grow operating income at a faster rate than net sales operating expenses for the three and six months ended july operating expenses increased and respectively when compared to the same periods in the prior year while net sales increased and over the same periods respectively our focus on ensuring every day low cost remains a priority throughout the company table of contents operating income our operating income grew by and for the three and six months ended july respectively when compared to the same periods in the prior year while net sales increased by and for the three and six months respectively over the prior year operating income for the three and six months ended july included a currency translation benefit of million and million respectively from the walmart international segment volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the companys operating income in the future returns return on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was and for the trailing month periods ended july and respectively the decline in roi is primarily attributable to acquisitions and currency translation fluctuations we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies table of contents the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows forthetrailingtwelvemonthsendedjuly dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of july certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of discontinued operations total assets as of july and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated free cash flow of billion for the six months ended july compared to billion for the six months ended july the increase in accounts payables from the timing of payment cycles benefited free cash flow last year free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity table of contents additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities sixmonthsendedjuly amounts in millions net

income tax rate was and for the three and six months ended july respectively and and for the three and six months ended july respectively we expect the fiscal annual effective tax rate to be at the lower end of our range of to significant factors that may impact our effective income tax rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the u s statutory rate as a result of the factors discussed above we reported billion and

the declines in comparable store sales are primarily due to a decline in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in average ticket gross profit margin was relatively flat during the three and

compared to the three and six months ended july table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of

were billion and billion at july and respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payments of dividends cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of payments for property and equipment which were billion and billion during the six months ended july and respectively these capital expenditures primarily relate to new store growth and remodeling costs for existing stores we expect capital expenditures for our fiscal year ending january to range between billion and billion excluding acquisitions during the six months ended july cash flows from investing activities also included billion related to the acquisitions of netto and massmart cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short and long term debt as well as dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock short term borrowings short term borrowings increased by billion at july compared to an increase of billion during the same period in the prior year from time to time we utilize the liquidity under our short term borrowing programs to fund our operations dividend payments share repurchases capital expenditures and for other cash requirements and corporate purposes on an as needed basis long term debt proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were billion and billion for the six months ended july and respectively the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were used to pay down or refinance existing debt and for other general corporate purposes table of contents information on our significant issuances of

on march the companys board of directors declared an annual dividend for fiscal of per share an increase of over the per share dividends paid in fiscal for the fiscal year ending january the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments according to the following record and payable dates record date payable date march april may june august september december january the dividend installment payable on april and june were paid as scheduled company share repurchase program from time to time the company has repurchased shares of its common stock under a billion share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on june and announced on june on june the companys board of directors replaced that share repurchase program which had approximately billion of remaining authorization for share repurchase as of that date with a new billion share repurchase program announced on june as a result the company terminated and will make no further share repurchases under the program announced on june as was the case with the replaced share repurchase program the new program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which the company can make share repurchases and will expire only when and if the company has repurchased billion of its shares under the newly authorized program or when it earlier terminates or replaces the newly authorized program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status the company considers several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things its current cash needs its capacity for leverage its cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock the companys share repurchases during the six months ended july and were as follows share repurchases millions except per share data totalnumberofshares repurchased averagepricepaidper share totalinvestment six months ended july six months ended july capital resources management believes cash flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes table of contents our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets has historically provided us with substantial sources of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness continuing to be at or above the level of our current ratings at july the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long term debt were as follows rating agency commercialpaper long termdebt standard poors a aa moodys investors service p aa fitch ratings f aa dbrs limited r middle aa in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or any rated series of our outstanding long term debt issues were lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of the companys long term debt securities were lower than those noted above our ability to access the debt markets would be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt i e the rate of interest on any such indebtedness would be higher than our cost of funds had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term financing we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors for the purpose of this calculation debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings long term debt due within one year obligations under capital leases due in one year long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases total capitalization is defined as debt plus total walmart shareholders equity we monitor the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization as support for our long term financing decisions at july and the ratio of our debt to total capitalization was and respectively our ratio of debt to our total capitalization increased during the six months ended july as a result of an increase in our long term debt coupled with a decline in shareholders equity primarily as a result of the amounts expended for cash dividends and share repurchases over the trailing twelve months ended july item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in currency exchange

subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty if their derivative liability position exceeds certain thresholds the company s transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held million in cash collateral from these counterparties at july it is the company s policy to record cash collateral exclusive of any derivative asset and any collateral holdings are reflected in its accrued liabilities as amounts due to the counterparties furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral if the derivative liability position exceeds million the company has no outstanding collateral postings and in the event of such the company would record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are

change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in
