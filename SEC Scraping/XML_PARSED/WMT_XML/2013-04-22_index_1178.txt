voted abstain with respect to any proposal is considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal but is not considered a vote cast with respect to that proposal therefore an

earnings performance also compared favorably with our original annual eps guidance for fiscal of to provided at the beginning of fiscal when our fiscal incentive goals were set the walmart u s segment delivered strong financial results with walmart u s comparable store sales increasing percent during fiscal walmart u s also grew sales faster than operating expenses during fiscal walmart international had solid overall performance for the year and continues to deliver growth despite challenging economic environments in several key markets and on a constant currency basis walmart international grew sales faster than operating expenses in fiscal our sams club segment sustained its positive momentum increasing comparable club sales by percent including the percent impact of fuel sales and delivering solid operating income our company continued to leverage operating expenses and our return on investment roi for fiscal was slightly less than the prior fiscal year primarily due to acquisitions and currency exchange rate fluctuations we again delivered strong returns to our shareholders in fiscal with our stock price increasing approximately percent during the fiscal year we also paid dividends of per share during the fiscal year for a total of approximately billion in dividends and returned approximately billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases when we released our fiscal earnings on february we announced that our board approved an increase in our annual dividend for fiscal resulting in an annual dividend of per share for fiscal information about

are working as designed as noted above our operating income performance during fiscal was good particularly for our walmart u s and sams club divisions which each exceeded the operating income goals established by the cngc under our cash incentive plan despite overall solid performance our international division fell short of its target fiscal operating income goals our total company slightly exceeded the challenging target operating income goals established by the cngc and our operating income performance was stronger during fiscal than during fiscal this performance was reflected in our

slightly above our target performance goal under this program our fiscal roi goal under the performance share program was slightly lower than our roi for fiscal due to the expected impact of acquisition activity and planned capital expenditures walmart u s and sams club sales exceeded the target performance goals under this program while walmart international sales results fell short of

advisory vote to approve executive compensation at our last two annual shareholders meetings our shareholders had an opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve our neos compensation at each of these meetings approximately percent of the votes cast on this matter were voted to approve our neos compensation the cngc believes that the results of these votes affirm our shareholders support of our approach to executive compensation the cngc considered that support when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal as a result the cngc made no material changes in the structure of our executive compensation program or the performance measures used in our executive compensation program for fiscal at the annual shareholders meeting we will again hold an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation see page the cngc will consider the results from this years and future years advisory votes on executive compensation when making decisions about our executive compensation program proxy statement back to contents our pay practices what we do what we do not do pay for performance we heavily link our executive compensation program to the companys operating performance and our strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns we ensure that a significant majority of our executives target compensation is performance based with the amount of the payout to our executives contingent on the degree to which the company achieves pre established performance goals that the cngc determines are aligned with the companys short and long term operating and financial objectives no employment contracts all of our neos are employed on an at will basis however each neo has entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with the company pursuant to which each neo has agreed that in exchange for limited severance benefits provided therein for a two year period following termination of employment he or she will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment mitigation of risk we use a combination of performance measures in determining our executives performance based compensation that motivate our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders by using a variety of performance measures in our annual cash incentive program and our long term performance share program we mitigate the risk that our executives would be motivated to pursue results with respect to one performance measure to the detriment of our company as a whole no unapproved trading plans board members and our executive officers are prohibited from entering into securities trading plans pursuant to sec rule b without the pre approval of our corporate secretary further no board member or any executive officer may trade in our stock without the pre approval of our corporate secretary annual shareholder say on pay

dividends on unvested performance shares we do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned and unvested performance shares rigorous compensation benchmarking the cngc reviews publicly available information for three different peer groups to evaluate how our neos compensation compares to that of executives in comparable positions at other companies and considers that information when establishing tdc no pension plans or special retirement programs for executive officers we do not have a pension plan and our executive officers do not participate in any retirement programs not generally available to our officers no golden parachutes or other change in control agreements other than post termination and non competition agreements providing for separation payments equal to two years of base salary in the event their employment is terminated other than for a violation of walmart policy we do not have any agreements under which our executive officers would receive payments or accelerated stock vestings in the event of a change in control of our company proxy statement back to contents components of neo compensation and pay mix what are the primary components of our neo compensation packages our neos each receive a base salary annual cash incentive opportunity long term performance shares and service based restricted stock these elements comprise each neos total direct compensation or tdc base salary we pay base salaries to attract and retain talented executives and to provide fixed base cash compensation our general objective is for our neo base salaries to be positioned near the th percentile of our peer groups considered as a whole in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates a relatively small percentage of tdc to base salary annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment each neos annual target cash incentive award is based on a percentage of base salary the cash incentive payout can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our ceos target opportunity is percent of his base salary and his actual payout can range from percent of his base salary at threshold up to a maximum of percent of his base salary no payout will be made unless threshold performance goals are met the cngc sets the performance goals under our management incentive plan during the first quarter of each fiscal year our general guideline is to set annual cash incentive opportunities at a level that positions our neos target tdc near the th percentile of our peer groups considered as a whole however individual target tdcs will vary based on the factors described under how does the cngc establish tdc on pages long term equity the balance of tdc and generally the largest portion is then allocated between two forms of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity awards help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders and also serve as a retention tool for our companys executives consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance percent of our annual long term equity awards is in the form of performance shares with the remaining percent granted in the form of restricted stock our general guideline is to set annual equity opportunities at a level that positions our neos target tdc near the th percentile of our peer groups considered as a whole however individual target tdcs will vary based on the factors described under how does the cngc establish tdc on pages performance shares a performance share award gives the recipient the right to receive a number of shares if we meet certain pre defined performance goals during a specified performance period generally performance shares granted to our executives have a three year performance period with the performance measures and goals set annually by the cngc the number of shares received at the end of the performance period is based on the average performance as compared to these performance goals over three fiscal years our neos can earn from percent at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target number of shares at the time of payout for tdc purposes performance shares are valued by multiplying the number of shares by the share price on the date of grant which differs from the grant date fair value reported on the summary compensation table on page due to the fact that performance shares do not recieve dividends prior to vesting restricted stock the remaining percent of the long term equity value is in the form of restricted stock which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the neo remains employed by our company through the vesting date what was the tdc for our neos during fiscal as shown in the table below target tdc represents the amounts our neos would receive if target performance goals are achieved maximum tdc represents the amounts our neos would receive if maximum performance goals are achieved and therefore is intended to reflect the amounts our neos would receive only in the event of superior performance all dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest

simon c douglas mcmillon rosalind g brewer proxy statement back to contents how much of our neos target tdc was performance based in fiscal as shown in the chart below a substantial majority of our neos fiscal target tdc was performance based base salary represented less than percent of our ceos target tdc for fiscal while more than percent of his target tdc was tied to performance goals for each of our other neos the percentage of target tdc that was performance based ranged from approximately percent to approximately percent the percentages may not total percent due to rounding were there any significant changes to our neos compensation for fiscal there were no significant changes to the basic tdc structure for neos in fiscal for fiscal our neos continuing in the same position received base salary increases ranging from approximately percent to approximately percent which is consistent with annual base salary increases for management associates generally the annual cash incentive opportunity for each of our neos continuing in the same position expressed as a percentage of base salary was unchanged for fiscal as part of their fiscal compensation packages approved in january some of our neos received increases in the target value of their annual equity awards comprised of performance shares and restricted stock as follows mr duke increase in target equity value from million to million mr simon increase in target equity value from million to million mr mcmillon increase in target equity value from million to million and mr holley increase in target equity value from million to million these increases were intended to reflect these neos continued experience in their leadership roles and to align their tdc more closely with external peer groups are there any significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal our executive incentive compensation programs continue to be based on the financial measures of sales operating income and roi which are aligned with our priorities of growth leverage and returns in addition to these financial measures for fiscal our executive compensation program will also have a compliance component our company has made significant improvements to our compliance programs around the world and has taken a number of specific concrete actions with respect to our processes procedures and people these steps have included aligning our global compliance ethics investigations and legal functions under one organization creating new senior global compliance and investigations positions and hiring seasoned professionals to fill these positions and implementing enhancements to how we report and investigate allegations of wrongdoing worldwide in order to further emphasize our companys ongoing commitment to such a program beginning in fiscal the annual cash incentive payment of each of our neos and certain other executive officers will also be subject to achieving certain compliance objectives during fiscal our companys senior leadership will evaluate the companys key compliance policies processes and controls and prepare a timetable for implementing further enhancements on a prioritized basis the fiscal compliance objectives these enhancements will address the key components of a corporate compliance program including leadership and resources standards and controls communication systems training and monitoring among others senior management will provide quarterly reports to the audit committee on the progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives if in the judgment of the audit committee the company has not achieved adequate progress in implementing the fiscal compliance objectives and taking into account such other considerations with respect to compliance matters for fiscal as the audit committee in its judgment may deem appropriate then the cngc may reduce or eliminate fiscal annual cash incentive compensation for the relevant executive officers proxy statement back to contents in addition to demonstrate the importance of accountability with regards to compliance matters our ceo agreed to an additional compliance component to his fiscal cash incentive payment at the conclusion of fiscal the audit committee and cngc will have the authority to consider compliance matters for both fiscal and fiscal in evaluating the annual cash incentive for our ceo at the conclusion of fiscal and as a result of such evaluation the cngc may in its discretion elect to recover a portion of the annual cash incentive payment made to our ceo for fiscal fiscal performance measures and performance goals what performance measures were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal each neos performance measures were based on the performance of our total company or a combination of the performance of our total company and the neos respective operating division this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating officers based on performance within their control or influence while continuing to align a significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company thereby driving the

purposes of the performance shares award measures we define return on investment which is a non gaap financial measure as defined in the secs rules as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from continuing operations for the fiscal year divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that fiscal year plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight return on assets is the most comparable gaap measure to return on investment further information may be found in exhibit to our annual report on form k for fiscal filed with the sec on march the cngc chose these performance measures to align with the companys strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns the cngc concluded that the combination of these performance measures was likely to motivate our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders in addition the cngc believes that the combination and weighting of these performance measures helps to mitigate the risk that our executives would be motivated to pursue results with respect to one measure to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts proxy statement back to contents what was the weighting among each of these performance measures for fiscal the following charts show the portion of each of our neos target tdc that was subject to each of these measures during fiscal what were our specific performance targets for fiscal

can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not satisfy these objectives for fiscal these objectives consisted of up to two components good faith efforts and placement objectives each of our neos is subject to good faith efforts requirements in order to satisfy the good faith efforts component of this program each neo must actively sponsor at least two associates and must also participate in at least two diversity related events each of our neos with responsibility for our walmart u s and or sams club field operations is also subject to placement objectives for fiscal mr duke mr simon and ms brewer were subject to placement objectives the determination as to whether an neo satisfies his or her placement objectives is based on several factors including the relative number of diverse candidates placed in specified positions within the neos organization the neo demonstrating engagement and participation in a diversity and inclusion strategy the neos leadership efforts in implementing these strategies and the neos efforts in recruiting and developing diverse associates applying these factors at the end of each fiscal year our chief diversity officer reviews each neos performance under our diversity program and reports the results of this review to the cngc prior to the approval of annual cash incentive payouts to our neos based on the report of our chief diversity officer the cngc determined that each neo satisfied his or her diversity goals for fiscal in determining actual performance for purposes of our performance based plans i e annual cash incentive and performance shares the cngc made certain positive and negative adjustments to our reported results as required by the terms of the applicable plans these adjustments are intended to enable results for a particular fiscal year to be computed on a comparable basis to the prior fiscal year and to ensure that our incentive plans reward underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives for fiscal the most significant adjustment was to remove the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates other adjustments included removing the effect of operating income and expenses related to recent acquisitions an increase in estimated contingent liabilities related to pending employment claims in brazil an accounting change related to the capitalization of certain labor costs for our global ecommerce division and property losses due to natural disasters while these adjustments had the effect of increasing the fiscal cash incentive payments earned by our neos for fiscal adjustments had the opposite effect decreasing the fiscal cash incentive payments earned by our neos as a result of these adjustments fiscal operating income

shown on page above proxy statement back to contents other compensation what other types of compensation did our neos receive for fiscal our neos may from time to time receive special awards special awards are typically granted for retention purposes or in recognition of extraordinary performance because these awards are not part of an neos annual compensation the special awards are not included in the tdc amounts shown above in january the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for mr simon in the amount of million half of this award was contingent on meeting performance goals for fiscal and half is contingent on meeting performance goals for fiscal in order for mr simon to earn the first half of this award walmart u s total sales had to increase by at least percent during fiscal because actual walmart u s total sales exceeded this goal mr simon earned million of this award which is included in mr simons compensation shown on the summary

retention purposes and to continue to emphasize the importance of walmart u s sales growth to our companys overall strategy in early the cngc approved a million special restricted stock award to ms

anniversaries of the grant date for mr holley the awards vest on various dates from january through january finally as is customary with executive officer promotions in february ms brewer received two additional performance share grants vesting at the conclusion of the performance cycles ending january and january these additional performance share awards were intended to increase ms brewers target performance share opportunity for each of those cycles to which is equal to the target value of her annual performance share award granted in february for the performance cycle ending january what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations for our neos and provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a limited number of hours each year our neos also receive company paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance additionally our neos are entitled to benefits available to officers generally such as participation in the deferred compensation matching plan and benefits available to associates generally including a walmart discount card a limited percent match of purchases of shares through our stock purchase plan participation in our k plan medical benefits and foreign business travel insurance we provide these perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives and we believe their limited cost is outweighed by these benefits to our company executive compensation process and governance who establishes the tdc at walmart the cngc is the board committee that is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the officers subject to section including the ceo and other neos all members of the cngc are independent see page for more information on the cngc the cngc met seven times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including matters suchas the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance measures and performance goals applicable to the neos performance based compensation and the review of performance against those goals how does the cngc establish tdc the process of setting tdc is a dynamic one the cngc considers among other things the overall financial and operating performance of our company and operating segments as applicable each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future peer group data and analyses see pages for more details and the results of recent shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation as a general guideline our neos target tdc which would be earned if target performance goals are achieved should place the neos near the th percentile of the peer groups for comparable positions the cngc believes that it is generally appropriate to position our neos target tdc at this level because as the worlds proxy statement back to contents largest retailer the companys size extensive international presence and complex operations result in our neos jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at many of our peer group companies the target tdc opportunity for a particular neo may be higher or lower than the th percentile of the peer groups depending on a number of factors particularly time and experience in a similar role expertise individual performance historical compensation levels and retention and succession considerations in evaluating individual performance the cngc relied on annual performance evaluations for each neo and discussions with the neos supervisor the differences in tdc among our neos are due to many factors these factors include the differences in job scope and responsibilities the cngcs review of peer group compensation information through peer benchmarking expertise and years of experience historical compensation levels retention and succession considerations and individual and where relevant divisional performance the tdc levels set forth in the chart above on page represent the cngcs judgment as to the appropriate fiscal compensation opportunities for our neos in light of these factors how does the cngc set performance goals the goals for our performance based compensation plans are established in light of the operating plans for our company and each of its operating divisions the companys operating plans for reaching our strategic goals are reviewed by the board in light of economic conditions in our industry and in the broader markets in which we operate the companys operating plans are generally intended to be challenging and fiscal was no exception particularly given the impact of the overall economic environment on our customers once operating plans are established by the board the cngc then sets performance goals that are intended to be aligned with our operating plans in order to achieve the target goals in our performance based plans our company and operating segments must perform in line with our sales operating income and return on investment expectations and operating plans at the time the goals were set in order to achieve the maximum goals the performance of our company and operating segments would have to exceed those expectations to a significant degree generally goals for our international division require greater increases in operating income and sales relative to our other divisions this reflects our strategic growth plans for our international operations in light of market conditions and the level of capital investment required for growth in the international markets in which we operate the cngc generally attempts to set the threshold and maximum performance goals so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the cngc generally establishes the maximum performance goals at a level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance goals at a level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify a payment the cngcs independent compensation consultant evaluates the difficulty of the performance goals and advises the cngc in this regard what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations of these neos provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our global people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews his annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc when establishing and approving the compensation of our ceo our chairman with support from our global people division and the chair of the cngc reviews our ceos performance evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation since early the cngc has engaged an independent consultant on executive compensation matters since early pay governance llc pay governance has been engaged by the cngc as its independent executive compensation consultant under the terms of its engagement pay governance reports directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc has sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting services to walmart without the approval of the cngc other than its engagement by the cngc pay governance does not and has not ever performed any services for walmart the cngcs independent consultant attends and participates in cngc meetings at which executive compensation matters are considered and performs analyses for the cngc at the cngcs request including benchmarking realizable pay analyses analyses of the correlation between performance measures and shareholder return and assessments of the difficulty of performance goals the cngc has reviewed the independence of pay governance in light of new sec rules and nyse listed company rules regarding compensation consultant independence and has affirmatively concluded that pay governance is independent from walmart and has no conflicts of interest relating to its engagement by the cngc how is peer group data used by the cngc our company is the worlds largest retailer by a substantial margin and has significantly more extensive international operations than most publicly traded u s based retailers as a result the cngc believes that simply benchmarking neo compensation against a retail industry index would not provide the cngc with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our neos therefore the cngc reviews publicly available information for three peer groups to determine how our neos compensation compares to the compensation paid to executives in comparable positions at other companies since information regarding positions comparable to those of some of our neos is not available for many of the companies in our peer groups using three peer groups results in a larger number of comparable positions against which our neos compensation can be benchmarked the cngc uses benchmarking data when allocating each neos tdc among the various elements of compensation as a general guide to ensure that the amount of tdc allocated to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation the cngc did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them while the benchmarking data is generally used for comparable positions the cngc also reviews peer group data for retail ceo positions for our executives proxy statement back to contents who lead our operating divisions these roles have significant responsibilities and we believe that these positions are often comparable to ceo positions at many of our peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint it is more likely that our operating segment leaders would be recruited for a ceo position rather than a lateral move therefore the cngc benchmarks these executives compensation against that of ceos within our retail peer groups retail industry survey this survey allows the cngc to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary competitors in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly traded retail companies with significant u s operations with annual revenues exceeding approximately billion which were amazon com inc the home depot inc rite aid corporation autonation inc j c penney company inc safeway inc best buy co inc

and ms brewers tdc was between the th and th percentiles select fortune the cngc also benchmarks our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by our global people division with input by the cngcs independent consultant the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we excluded retailers from this group because those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also excluded companies with business models that are broadly divergent from ours such as financial institutions and energy companies the companies included in the select fortune when setting fiscal compensation were archer daniels midland company honeywell international inc pepsico inc att inc ingram micro inc pfizer inc caterpillar inc intel corporation philip morris

approximately times larger in terms of market capitalization than the retail industry survey at the median to take into account this size discrepancy and the corresponding complexity of our neos job

information does the cngc consider when establishing tdc the cngc also reviews other information in the process of setting tdc although the cngc generally considers these factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized compensation the cngc reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years thecngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys global people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation as noted above on page our shareholders have expressed strong support for our executive compensation program at the last two annual shareholders meetings the cngc considered that support when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal the cngc will continue to consider the outcome of these annual advisory votes when making future compensation decisions for our neos what are our practices for granting stock options and other equity awards option exercise prices we did not grant any stock options to our neos during fiscal and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances when we grant stock options the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our neos for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance shares and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible unless it is performance based a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos is designed to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under section m moreover the terms of equity awards granted to our neos generally provide that upon vesting the receipt of such equity will be deferred if the payment of such equity would not be dedicutible for federal income tax purposes when designing neo compensation the cngc considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes the cngc retains the ability to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos all neos are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his or her violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period following his or her termination of employment he or she will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment in this context a competing business generally means any retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by walmart with annual revenues in excess of certain thresholds these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company we do not have any contracts or other arrangements with our neos that provide for payments or other benefits upon a change in control of our company see potential payments upon termination or change in control on page for more information proxy statement back to contents what types of retirement and other benefits are our neos eligible for our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation matching plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our k plan our neos do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or non payment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our mip and our stock incentive plan both provide that we will recoup awards to the extent required by walmart policies furthermore our mip provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the participant must repay the incentive award upon demand the amended mip submitted for aprroval at the annual shareholders meeting includes an expanded clawback provision see page similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of our stock to further align the long term interests of our executives and our shareholders the board has approved the following stock ownership guidelines our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to five times his current annual base salary and each of our other executive officers and certain other officers must beginning on the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to a position covered by the stock ownership guidelines maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to three times his or her current annual base salary if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any shares that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in compliance with such guidelines until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines further as noted below any shares pledged by a board member or executive officer will not be counted when determining whether the board member or executive officer is in compliance with the guidelines the board or the cngc can modify these guidelines in the event of dramatic and unexpected changes in the market value of our shares or in other circumstances that the board or the cngc deem appropriate currently each of our neos is in compliance with our ownership guidelines the following graph clearly illustrates that all of our neos currently subject to the requirements of the stock ownership guidelines well exceed the minimum stock ownership requirements applicable to them ms brewer is not included in the graph above because she has not yet reached the required compliance date applicable to the stock ownership guidelines proxy statement back to contents are there any restrictions on the ability of our neos to engage in transactions involving company stock yes our insider trading policy contains the following restrictions our directors and executive officers may trade in our stock only during open window periods and only after they have pre cleared transactions with our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not enter into trading plans pursuant to rule b without having such plans pre approved by our corporate secretary our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in hedging transactions such as swaps collars and similar financial instruments that would eliminate or limit the risks and rewards of walmart stock ownership our directors and executive officers may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell options puts or calls whether exchange traded or otherwise or engage in any other transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using walmart stock as collateral for any margin loan before using walmart stock as collateral for any other borrowing our directors and executive officers must satisfy the following requirements the pledging arrangement must be pre approved by walmarts corporate secretary and any walmart shares pledged will not be counted when determining whether the directors or executive officer is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines currently none of our independent directors or executive officers have any pledging arrangements in place involving walmart stock one non management director has pledged shares related to a line of credit as disclosed on page under holdings of officers and directors risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the performance based cash incentive and performance share portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our performance based incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures namely operating income based measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significantpercentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe motivate our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our performance based incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold our executive officers fiscal cash incentive payments are subject to reduction if certain compliance objectives are not satisfied finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests

approve named executive officer compensation section a of the exchange act and related sec rules require that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve on a non binding advisory basis the compensation of our neos as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with sec rules we must provide this opportunity to our shareholders at least once every three years however following the recommendation of our shareholders at our annual shareholders meeting our board has chosen to hold this vote every year as described above under compensation discussion and analysis our executive compensation program is designed with an emphasis on performance and is intended to closely align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that compensation is closely tied to aspects of our companys performance that our executive officers can impact and that is likely to have an impact on shareholder value our compensation programs are also designed to balance long term performance with shorter term performance and to mitigate any risk that an executive officer would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single performance measure or company division to the detriment of our company as a whole in the compensation discussion and analysis referred to above we discuss why we believe the compensation of our neos for fiscal properly reflected our companys performance in fiscal we urge you to read carefully the compensation discussion and analysis the compensation tables and the related narrative discussion in this proxy statement the vote on this proposal is advisory which means that the vote will not be binding on walmart the board or the

plan awards made under the plan are instrumental in attracting and retaining key talent throughout our company shareholder approval of the performance measures contained in the plan is required to maintain the tax deductibility of awards made to covered employees as defined in section m of the internal revenue code as discussed in greater detail in compensation discussion and analysis beginning on page incentive plan awards are a key element of our pay for performance philosophy with respect to our neo compensation and the amended mip provides for a clawback of the incentive plan award if the cngc determines within months following the payment of an award under the plan or before the award is paid that the participant engaged in acts deemed inimical to the best interests of the company or violated company policy or the clawback is otherwise required by company policy the recent amendments further strengthen this clawback by providing that all incentive plan awards will be subject to

shareholder proposals based on broader policy reasons as set forth in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal in our statements in opposition we have not attempted to refute all of the assertions made about walmart in the shareholder proposals proxy statement back to contents proposal no special shareowner meeting right resolved shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary unilaterally to the fullest extent permitted by law to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders of of our outstanding common stock or the lowestpercentage permitted by law above the power to call a special shareowner meeting this includes that such bylaw and or charter text will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language in regard to calling a special meeting that apply only to shareowners but not to management and or the board to the fullest extent permitted by law this proposal does not impact our boards current power to call a special meeting special meetings allow shareowners to vote on important matters such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings shareowner input on the timing of shareowner meetings is especially important when events unfold quickly and issues may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal topic won more than support at cvs sprint and safeway this proposal should also be evaluated in the context of our companys overall corporate governance as reported in gmi the corporate library an independent investment research firm had rated our company d continuously since the first term of the bush administration with high governance risk also concern for our directors qualifications and high concern in executive pay million for michael duke mr dukes annual incentive pay relied on only one performance goal operating income a mix of performance goals is better not just to prevent our executives from the temptation to game results but to ensure that they do not take actions to achieve one goal that might ultimately damage another despite missing operating income targets mr duke received million in annual incentive pay our highest paid executives continued to be given restricted stock that simply vested over time without job performance requirements equity pay should have job performance requirements to align with shareholder interest these executives also were given a so called long term incentive of performance shares which were based on short term results of years our highest paid executives received the key to the corporate jet for their personal travel because such a perk is not tied to job performance it is difficult to justify in terms of shareholder value two directors were inside executives another director was a former executive and two other directors were potentially conflicted due to related party transactions rpts with entities affiliated with wal mart additionally there are several other related party transactions involving walton family members and wal mart executives that raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of our board in representing the interests of us the minority shareholders in spite of the walton family controlling of the vote four directors received double digits in negative votes lee scott christopher williams ceo michael duke and chairman robson walton please vote to protect shareholder value special shareowner meeting right proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board believes that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best interests of our company or its shareholders consistent with delaware corporate law our bylaws provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called by a majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and ceo this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for a public company of our size because it allows our board according to its fiduciary obligations to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best interests of shareholders to convene a special meeting permitting shareholders with as little as tenpercent of the outstanding shares regardless of the holding period to call special meetings for any reason and at any time creates the risk of special meetings being called by a relatively small minority of shareholders focused on narrow or short term interests rather than the long term best interests of the company and all of its shareholders we take shareholders meetings very seriously and take steps to provide shareholders with access to our shareholders meetings including making our shareholders meetings available via webcast holding a special meeting of our shareholders at the request of only tenpercent of our shareholders would be a costly undertaking involve substantial planning and require us to commit significant resources and attention to the legal and logistical elements of such a meeting for example we would incur legal printing and mailing costs associated with preparing and distributing the disclosure documents required for a special shareholders meeting the board also believes that the merits of this proposal should be viewed in light of our companys high standards of corporate governance as discussed in this proxy statement our companys existing governance policies and practices provide shareholders with access to the board and members of senior management and offer ample opportunity for shareholders to express their views to management these governance policies include the annual election of all board members and a majority voting requirement for the election of directors the board has also determined to include an advisory vote on executive compensation at each annual shareholders meeting until the next required vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation because the board believes it is important to receive feedback from shareholders on this important issue annually in addition shareholders may submit shareholder proposals which if appropriate under the secs rules may be included in our annual proxy statement and voted on at our annual shareholders meeting furthermore the rules governing companies listed on the nyse and incorporated under delaware law require us to submit certain matters to a vote of shareholders for approval such as mergers large share issuances or similar transactions and the approval of equity based compensation plans for the above reasons the board recommends that theshareholders vote against this proposal proxy statement back to contents proposal no equity retention requirement resolved shareholders of wal mart stores inc the company urge the compensation committee of the board of directors the committee to adopt a policy requiring that senior executives retain a significantpercentage of shares acquired through equity compensation programs until reaching normal retirement age or terminating employment with the company for the purpose of this policy normal retirement age shall be defined by the companys qualified retirement plan that has the largest number of plan participants the shareholders recommend that the committee adopt a share retentionpercentage requirement of at least percent of net after tax shares the policy should prohibit hedging transactions for shares subject to this policy which are not sales but reduce the risk of loss to the executive this policy shall supplement any other share ownership requirements that have been established for senior executives and should be implemented so as not to violate the companys existing contractual obligations or the terms of any compensation or benefit plan currently in effect supporting statement equity based compensation is an important component of senior executive compensation at our company while we encourage the use of equity based compensation for senior executives we are concerned that our companys senior executives are generally free to sell shares received from our companys equity compensation plans in our opinion the companys current share ownership guidelines for its senior executives do not go far enough to ensure that the companys equity compensation plans continue to build stock ownership by senior executives over the long term for example our companys share ownership guidelines require the chief executive officer the ceo to hold an amount of shares equal to five times his salary or approximately shares based on current trading prices in comparison the ceo currently owns million shares in our company granted the ceo up to performance share awards assuming maximum performance and restricted shares in other words even if performance shares are discounted one years equity awards are more than half the companys share ownership guideline for the ceo we believe that requiring senior executives to only hold shares equal to a set target loses effectiveness over time after satisfying these target holding requirements senior executives are free to sell all the additional shares they receive in equity compensation our proposal seeks to better link executive compensation with long term performance by requiring a meaningful share retention ratio for shares received by senior executives from the companys equity compensation plans requiring senior executives to hold a significantpercentage of shares obtained through equity compensation plans until they reach retirement age will better align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders and the company a report by the conference board task force on executive compensation observed that such hold through retirement requirements give executives an ever growing incentive to focus on long term stock price performance as the equity subject to the policy increases availableat http www conference board org pdf free execcompensation pdf we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no we have adopted robust stock ownership guidelines and other governance policies to ensure that our ceo executive officers and certain other officers are focused on walmarts long term success and that their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders as explained in the cda above walmarts stock ownership guidelines require that our ceo maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted walmart stock equal in market value to five times his current annual base salary and that all of our executive officers and certain other officers must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted walmart stock equal in market value to three times his or her current annual base salary these officers have five years from their appointment to a position covered by our stock ownership guidelines to achieve these levels of ownership if any covered officer is not in compliance with the guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any walmart shares that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in compliance with the guidelines until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines as disclosed in the cda each of our neos currently subject to the ownership guidelines is in compliance with these guidelines and in many cases own walmart stock significantly in excess of the guideline requirements for example as disclosed in the cda and noted in the proponents proposal our ceo owns shares valued at more than times his current base salary while certain of our executives subject to the guidelines have not yet been in a position covered by the guidelines for five years each of these individuals is expected to be in compliance with the guidelines at the time he or she reaches the applicable compliance date in addition to the ownership guidelines the companys insider trading policy restricts the ability of the members of the board and executive officers to engage in speculative transactions involving company stock as discussed in the cda above the insider trading policy prohibits hedging transactions such as swaps collars and similar financial instruments that would eliminate or limit the risks and rewards of walmart stock ownership furthermore members of the board and executive officers may not at any time use walmart stock as collateral for a margin loan before using walmart stock as collateral for any other borrowing members of our board and executive officers must have the pledging arrangement pre approved by walmarts corporate secretary and any walmart shares pledged by a member of the board or an executive officer will not be counted when determining whether the member of the board or executive officer is in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines additionally the insider trading policy prohibits short selling buying or selling options puts or calls whether exchange traded or otherwise or engaging in any other transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place the financial interests of the members of the board and executive officers against the financial interests of our company moreover we believe the cngc is the governing body best suited to formulate the companys executive compensation policies as described in the cda the cngc has designed our executive compensation program so that long term equity awards are generally the largest portion of our executives annual compensation packages the long term equity awards are allocated percent in the form of performance shares which vest if the company meets pre defined performance goals over a three year period provided the executive remains employed by our company and percent in the form of restricted stock which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the executive proxy statement back to contents remains employed by our company these awards are designed to help align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders and also serve as a retention tool for our companys executives a policy that would require senior executives to hold percent of their equity awards until reaching normal retirement age would put our company at a competitive disadvantage for recruiting and retaining top talent and is not a common practice among our companys peer groups in addition this policy would restrict the ability of our executives to diversify their investment portfolios and could motivate executives to leave walmart earlier than they otherwise would have so they could realize the value of their equity compensation for the foregoing reasons we believe this proposal is unnecessary and would provide no benefit to the company or its shareholders walmarts existing stock ownership guidelines and other governance policies effectively facilitate significant stock ownership by walmart executives and adopting the proposal would not be in the best interests of walmarts shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that theshareholders vote against this proposal proposal no independent chairman resolved the stockholders of wal mart stores inc the company ask the board of directors to adopt a policy that whenever possible the board chairman should be a director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the company and who is independent of management for these purposes a director shall not be considered independent if during the last three years he or she was or was affiliated with a company that was an advisor or consultant to the company or a significant customer or supplier of the company was employed by or had a personal service contract s with the company or its senior management was affiliated with a company or non profit entity that received the greater of million or of its gross annual revenues from the company had a business relationship with the company that the company had to disclose under the securities and exchange commission regulations has been employed by a public company at which an executive officer of the company serves as a director had a relationship of the sort described above with any affiliate of the company and was a spouse parent child sibling or in law of any person described above the policy should be implemented without violating any contractual obligation and should specify how to select an independent chairman if a current chairman ceases to be independent between annual shareholder meetings compliance with the policy may be excused if no independent director is available and willing to be chairman supporting statement the board of directors led by its chairman is responsible for protecting shareholders long term interests by providing independent oversight of management including the chief executive officer ceo in directing the corporations affairs in our view this oversight can be diminished when the chairman is not independent we believe that an independent chairman who sets agendas priorities and procedures for the board can enhance its oversight and accountability of management and help ensure the objective functioning of an effective board we view the alternative of having a lead outside director even one with a robust set of duties as adequate only in exceptional circumstances fully disclosed by the board recent bribery and corruption issues at the companys mexican subsidiary highlight the need for enhanced oversight of wal marts corporate culture and behaviour a board led by an independent chairman is best positioned to drive such change several respected institutions recommend such separation calpers corporate core principles and guidelines state that the independence of a majority of the board is not enough the leadership of the board must embrace independence and it must ultimately change the way in which directors interact with management in yale school of managements millstein center issued a report endorsed by a number of investors and directors that recommended splitting the two positions as the default provision for u s companies we urge you to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart has always strived to maintain high corporate governance standards in keeping with this goal the board has separated the roles of chairman and ceo since as stated in our corporate governance guidelines the board has a policy of separating the roles of chairman and ceo as described under the heading board leadership structure above we believe this separation of roles allows our ceo to focus on managing walmarts complex daily operations we also believe that having a separate chairman focused on oversight and governance matters allows the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role in addition we have a number of other key corporate governance measures that ensure our board acts independently of management independent presiding director since our board has appointed an independent presiding director over executive sessions of our non management directors and independent directors majority independent board currently of the members of our board are independent and of the board members are non management directors fully independent key board committees all members of the audit committee and compensation nominating and governance committee are independent the chairs of these committees are heavily engaged in establishing agendas for committee meetings annual board and board committee self assessments as required by our corporate governance guidelines the board and each of the board committees evaluate their organization and processes each year to ensure that the board and board committees are functioning effectively our chairman has more than years of experience with walmart and is well positioned to provide our ceo with guidance advice and counsel regarding walmarts business operations and strategy moreover our chairmans significant proxy statement back to contents ownership stake in our company provides unparalleled alignment with the interests of his fellow shareholders our shareholders have recognized the effectiveness of our current board leadership structure by re electing our chairman and other board members by wide margins each year we note that the proponent in its supporting statement cites a report by the yale school of managements millstein center for corporate governance and performance chairing the board the case for independent leadership in corporate north america available at http millstein som yale edu sites millstein som yale edu files chairing the board final pdf the millstein report far from supporting this proposal a significant portion of the millstein report focuses on the value of separating the roles of chair and ceo a structure that walmart already has in place moreover the millstein report recognizes that there is no one size fits all approach to board leadership the vast majority of advocates of the separation of the roles of chair and ceo recognizes that specific company conditions may warrant the combination under exceptional circumstances in these cases most would agree that companies should explain to shareowners why such an alternative model best serves the long term interests of the corporation and its investors for example a situation in which a company may choose to explain rather than comply with separating the roles may include a family controlled enterprise in which the ceo and chair is the majority shareowner millstein report at for the above reasons the board recommends that theshareholders vote against this proposal proposal no request for annual report on recoupment of executive pay resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors the board to adopt a policy the policy that walmart will disclose annually whether walmart in the previous fiscal year recouped any incentive or stock compensation from any senior executive or caused a senior executive to forfeit an outstanding incentive or stock compensation award in each case as a result of a determination that the senior executive breached a company policy or engaged in conduct inimical to the interests of or detrimental to walmart for purposes of this proposal senior executive includes a former senior executive the policy should provide that the general circumstances of the recoupment or forfeiture will be described the policy should also provide that if no recoupment or forfeiture of the kind described above occurred in the previous fiscal year a statement to that effect will be included in the report the disclosure made under the policy is intended to supplement not supplant any disclosure of recoupment or forfeiture required by law or regulation supporting statement as long term shareholders we believe that compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation we agree with former ge general counsel ben heineman jr that recoupment policies with business related misconduct triggers are a powerful mechanism for holding senior leadership accountable to the fundamental mission of the corporation proper risk taking balanced with proper risk management and the robust fusion of high performance with high integrity http blogs law harvard edu corpgov making sense out of clawbacks walmart has mechanisms in place to recoup certain incentive compensation upon a finding of unethical conduct walmarts management incentive plan provides for recoupment of incentive compensation paid in the previous months if the compensation nominating and governance committee the committee determines that the recipient engaged in any act deemed inimical to the best interests of the company or failed to comply with company policies management incentive plan section b similarly the stock incentive plan provides for forfeiture of outstanding awards and repayment of amounts received in respect of certain plan awards in the event the recipient is found by the committee to have engaged in conduct detrimental to walmarts best interests stock incentive plan of section separation agreements with several recently retired senior executives state that walmart is entitled to suspend and recoup payments made under any agreement with the executive if a failure on the executives part to abide by walmarts statement of ethics is discovered disclosure of the application of these recoupment forfeiture provisions to senior executives would inform walmarts shareholders whether the provisions have been applied and allow shareholders to hold members of the committee accountable for their administration of the provisions for example disclosure would enable shareholders to determine whether walmart recouped compensation from any current or former senior executive as a result of foreign corrupt practices act violations currently being investigated in mexico china india and brazil http www nytimes com business wal mart expands foreign bribery investigation html pagewanted all we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal because existing sec disclosure rules already require sufficient disclosures regarding walmarts comprehensive recoupment policies and practices the board and our management believe that compensation policies should promote sustainable value creation that is why we include in our compensation plans offer letters and other agreements numerous terms and conditions that give us broad rights to recoup or not to pay compensation otherwise payable to associates or former associates who have engaged in misconduct we believe that these recoupment rights are broader than those provided to the boards and management of many companies and reflect walmarts strong commitment to ethics and integrity walmarts broad existing recoupment rights include the following our cash incentive plan states that a participant must have complied with walmarts policies including our statement of ethics at all times in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment moreover a participant must repay an incentive award upon demand if the cngc determines within twelve months of its payment that prior to the awards payment the participant violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts inimical to the best interests of our company proxy statement back to contents our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares when an executive officer leaves walmart we generally enter into a separation agreement that states t he associate acknowledges that the associate has complied with the applicable statement of ethics during the associates employment the discovery of a failure to abide by the statement of ethics whenever discovered shall entitle walmart to suspend and recoup any payments paid or due under this agreement or any other agreements between the parties our statement of ethics among other directives forbids all associates from being dishonest acting illegally and having conflicts between the associates work and personal affairs walmart and the board are committed to pursuing recoupment actions against current and former associates believed to have acted unethically we already are required by sec disclosure requirements to disclose in our annual proxy statement when compensation has been recouped and the amount recouped from our neos moreover where necessary to an understanding of our compensation policies and compensation decisions regarding the neos we already must disclose in our annual proxy statement the reasons for the recoupment and how we determined the amount to be recovered this proposal seeks to require these disclosures with respect to all current and former senior executives a term that is not defined in the proposal however as noted above the secs existing disclosure rules already require walmart to disclose recoupment from both certain current and former executive officers who served during the prior fiscal year to the extent that such individuals meet the secs definition of an neo we do not believe that expanding the disclosure requirements to all current and former senior executives is warranted in sum the board believes this proposal is unnecessary because existing sec disclosure rules already require sufficient disclosures regarding walmarts comprehensive recoupment policies and practices for the above reasons the board recommends that theshareholders vote against this proposal other matters our company is not aware of any matters that will be considered at the annual shareholders meeting other than the matters described in this proxy statement if any other matters are properly brought before
