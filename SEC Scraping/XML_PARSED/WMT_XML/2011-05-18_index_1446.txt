comptroller of the city of new york centre street new york ny john c liu comptroller may dear wal mart stores shareowner on behalf of the new york city pension funds nyc funds i urge you to vote for proposal no require supplier s to publish an annual sustainability reportat wal mart stores annual meeting on friday june the proposal calls on wal marts board of directors to require the companys suppliers to publish annually an independently verifiable sustainability report among other important disclosures a report would include a suppliers objective assessment and measurement of performance on workplace safety and human and worker rights using internationally recognized standards indicators and measurement protocols in addition a report would include incidents of non compliance actions taken to remedy those incidents and measures taken to contribute to long term prevention and mitigation the securities and exchange commission rejected wal marts arguments that it could exclude the proposal from its proxy statement on the grounds that it relates to the companys ordinary business operations or that the company had already substantially implemented the proposal the nyc funds collectively hold million shares of wal mart common stock valued at approximately million as of may as new york city comptroller i serve as investment advisor custodian and a trustee for the nyc funds as long term investors the nyc funds affirm that the global integration of sustainability into business strategies and cultures is critically needed for the protection and enhancement of long term investments and sustainable economic prosperity however the failure of suppliers to integrate sustainability into their strategic plans and culture poses a major impediment to the achievement of this important goal consider the following the un global compact accenture ceo study a new era of sustainability found that ceos viewed the integration of sustainability issues into the supply chain as the most significant performance gap in executing sustainability wal mart does not publicly disclose the thousands of suppliers it has abroad making it difficult for human rights organizations and labor groups to identify and engage in private monitoring of working conditions at factories where wal marts products are manufactured a number of wal marts foreign suppliers have been repeatedly accused of subjecting workers to sweatshop conditions and using forced child labor wal marts supplier sustainability assessment is grossly inadequate because it simply asks suppliers to provide yes or no answers in response to very general questions regarding energy and climate material efficiency and social compliance given wal marts apparent inadequate monitoring of its suppliers compliance with its standards for suppliers the long term interests of wal mart its shareholders and suppliers would be better served if wal mart requires its suppliers to publish annual independently verifiable sustainability reports this approach derives from the old adage what gets measured gets done the independently verifiable reporting requirement would drive suppliers to establish performance goals and benchmarks that would help to integrate sustainability including workplace safety and human and worker rights into their business strategies and cultures please contact michael garland executive
