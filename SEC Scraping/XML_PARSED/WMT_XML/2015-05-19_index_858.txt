k street n w suite washington dc written materials are submitted pursuant to rule a g promulgated under the securities exchange act of may please vote against the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation at wal mart inc s nyse wmt annual meeting on june dear wal mart inc shareholder as we noted last year and despite the compensation nominations and governance committee cngc s claim that it seeks to align pay with performance wal mart executives continue to receive outsized compensation relative to lackluster performance according to equilar wal mart this year ranks in the nd percentile for pay but just the th percentile for total shareholder returns over the past three and five years equilar has given wal mart s pay performance alignment scores of and respectively indicating a significant long term misalignment as it has in the past this year the wal mart boards cngc has lowered performance targets and made numerous after the fact adjustments to its performance measures that have resulted in this stark divergence between pay and performance targeted levels for performance measures including return on investment roi us operating income growth and total company sales growth have all been reduced concurrent with declining performance the roi target which is given a weight in determining the vesting of wal marts equity grants to its named executives has been steadily reduced for the past seven years wal mart makes numerous adjustments to the performance measures it employs using contradictory justifications on the one hand the cngc argues that the assessment of executive performance should not be influenced by factors outside of executive control such as global macroeconomic fluctuations on the other the cngc asserts that such assessments should not reflect the effects of store closings restructurings acquisitions and dispositions but these factors clearly are under the control of executives and would seem to reflect their strategic acumen business planning and ability to execute plans successfully moreover these adjustments appear to be large and almost always raise performance on the adjusted measure relative to performance reported in the k in fy wal marts annual cash incentive plan payments provided payouts to named executives of at least of target even though the unadjusted performance on the relevant metrics was far lower for instance ceo douglas mcmillon received a cash incentive plan payout of of target equal to of annual salary when unadjusted performance achieved only a weighted average of of targeted performance while wal mart announced an important initiative to raise associate pay in january the company s approach to human capital management remains unbalanced we calculate that over the past year ceo mcmillon s total direct compensation equaled approximately x the annual pay of full time sales associates as reported by glassdoor com compared to x in fy and to x for previous ceo mike duke in fy with the companys share price now having underperformed the sp by percentage points over the past years percentage points over the past years and percentage points in the past year alone it is urgent for shareholders to send a clear message that a more balanced approach to human capital management is overdue the ctw investment group works with union sponsored pension funds sponsored by affiliates of change to win to enhance long term shareholder value through active ownership these funds have over billion in assets under management and are substantial wmt shareholders targets fall along with performance the wal mart boards cngc has repeatedly lowered the levels of the financial metrics it targets for performance related pay purposes and has done so again this year figure one below illustrates this problem as it relates to return on investment and total company sales the two metrics used to determine vesting of performance shares for wal marts ceo additionally each of the other metrics used in the performance share plan us sales international sales and sam s club sales was lowered significantly between fy and fy while the cngc insists that it does not undermine its performance goals by lowering these targets we find their reasoning unpersuasive indeed research by pay governance indicates that stretch targets for executives appear to successfully drive outperformance suggesting that wal mart s lackluster growth may have resulted in part from the cngc s failure to set and hold to genuinely demanding targets adjustments to performance measures further delink pay from performance additionally wal mart adjusts the performance measures it targets both for its annual cash incentive plan and for its performance share units to exclude a variety of costs associated with store closings restructurings acquisitions and dispositions as well as to remove the effects of exchange rate fluctuations losses and accruals related to litigation and losses attributable to walmart com and samsclub com as we note above the cngc s justifications for these adjustments contradict one another if performance should only be measured based on factors under executive control then why exclude the effects of store closings restructurings or wal mart s online operations since these are all clearly subject to executive control we further note that it is common for companies with significant international operations to hedge their currency exposure and that wal mart does report holding securities for such exchange rate hedging purposes it is not clear to us why such hedging strategies would not be under executive control or why the effectiveness of such strategies should not affect performance evaluation for pay purposes moreover it is remarkable how frequently the adjustments made by the cngc have a positive rather than negative effect on measured performance of the ten performance measures subject to adjustments across wal mart s performance related pay plans nine adjustments had the effect of raising performance and the one negative adjustment lowered performance by only the positive adjustments ranged from to as noted below these adjustments substantially increased the payouts to executives relative to their likely level based on unadjusted performance ira kay et al are companies setting challenging target incentive goals pay governance december excessive annual cash incentive payments given performance misses in fy wal mart fell short of targeted performance on of the measures used in determining the annual cash incentive payments even taking into account the significant positive the one negative adjustment was made to a metric used only in the performance share plan adjustments to of these metrics nevertheless executives still received large payouts under this program for each named executive the payout amounted to at least of salary and for ceo mcmillon it totaled these payouts would presumably have been much lower without the large significant adjustments to these measures for instance mr mcmillon s weighted average adjusted performance equaled of targeted performance and his cash incentive payout totaled of the targeted payout but on an unadjusted basis the company achieved only of the weighted average performance goals on which the ceo is evaluated for the cash incentive plan there are similar large divergences between the percentage of targeted performance achieved on an unadjusted basis and the percentage of target payout awarded to the other named executives mr foran received a payout based on achieving just of performance goals on an unadjusted basis adjusted mr cheesewright received a payout based on achievement of of targeted performance on an unadjusted basis adjusted once again over the past year the wal mart board and the cngc have found numerous mechanisms to delink pay from performance and provide scant if not implausible explanations for their decisions consequently wal mart has one of the highest ceo pay ratios in the united states even while its same store sales stagnate and its stock price lags we urge you to join us in insisting that the cngc take a new balanced approach by voting against the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation at wal mart inc s nyse wmt annual meeting on june dieter waizenegger executive director
