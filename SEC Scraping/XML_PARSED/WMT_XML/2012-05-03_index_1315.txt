behalf of the new york city pension funds nyc funds i urge you to vote against wal mart directors michael t duke h lee scott jr arne m sorenson s robson walton and christopher j williams at the companys annual shareowner meeting on june in fayetteville arkansas the nyc funds are long term wal mart shareowners with million shares we are taking this extraordinary step in light of the recently reported cover up in and of alleged widespread bribery in mexico which occurred at the same time the audit committee was stonewalling repeated shareowner demands for a comprehensive independent compliance review as well as our more general concerns with the boards independence specifically we believe directors duke and scott failed to act in shareowners best interests when confronted with credible allegations of widespread bribery director williams bears responsibility for the audit committees failure to ensure adequate internal compliance controls in and notwithstanding repeated shareowner concerns director sorenson who joined the board in is not independent given his role as ceo of marriott international which has a multi million dollar vendor relationship with wal mart and director s r walton whose ownership effectively guarantees his re election and that of his fellow directors is the affiliated chair of a board that is not at least two thirds independent in addition we believe it is inappropriate for the audit committee to oversee the independent investigation belatedly launched in december we do not consider audit committee director sorenson to be independent while the investigation involves matters for which committee chair williams may have been ultimately responsible given his role on the committee at the time background reported cover up underscores shareowners longstanding compliance concerns the recent new york times report that wal mart quashed an independent investigation into allegations that its executives systematically bribed mexican officials from to suggests a disturbing disregard for legal and ethical compliance at the highest levels of the corporation if the allegations are true the company not only violated the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa but may also have broken federal securities and other laws possibly including criminal statutes it remains unclear whether wal marts non executive directors were informed by management of the bribery allegations or had knowledge of or approved decisions to reject the independent investigation recommended by outside counsel that had extensive expertise in the fcpa what is clear is that wal marts failure to pursue a timely independent investigation in has potentially exposed the corporation and its shareowners to even more serious financial and reputational harm two current inside directors ceo michael duke and former ceo h lee scott were aware of the allegations and in mr scotts case took steps to shut down a thorough independent investigation the audit committee failed to ensure adequate internal controls with respect to wal marts legal and regulatory compliance as evidenced by the companys failure to respond appropriately when the bribery allegations surfaced in if the underlying bribery allegations are true the companys failure to detect the fraudulent accounting used to hide substantial illegal payments over several years would reflect weak internal controls over financial reporting as well the audit committees failure with respect to legal and regulatory compliance is especially troubling given that in three separate letters between may and may then nyc comptroller william c thompson jr joined by other institutional shareowners requested that wal marts audit committee retain independent counsel to conduct a comprehensive review of wal marts legal and regulatory controls and issue a report to shareowners with findings and recommendations i encourage you to review the letters and the audit committee chairs response all of which we have now made available at http comptroller nyc gov press walmart html the shareowners who were unaware of the concurrent bribery allegations that have recently come to light specifically expressed serious concerns about reports of legal and regulatory non compliance at wal mart the comptrollers office and allied shareowners discussed these concerns with two audit committee directors including current audit committee chair christopher j williams in a meeting at the comptrollers office on september following the meeting the nyc funds and other shareowners reiterated the request for an independent review in a letter dated november the letter specifically cited a cavalier attitude toward legal compliance at the highest levels of management and included a three page addendum with very specific questions regarding compliance systems whistleblower policies and protections and procedures for addressing allegations of wrongdoing among other policies although unknown to shareowners at the time only weeks earlier wal mart executives had inexplicably rejected an independent investigation of alleged bribery of mexican officials and instead launched a limited internal inquiry according to the new york times conclusion for the reasons stated in this letter i urge you to vote against the five wal mart directors named above at present the nyc funds lack sufficient information to cast an informed vote on five additional nominees who have been on the board since at least unless information becomes available clarifying whether or not these additional directors had knowledge of the bribery allegations and aborted independent investigation the funds intend to abstain on their election please dont hesitate to contact michael garland executive director for corporate governance at for additional information sincerely john c liu
