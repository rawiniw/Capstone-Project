under the bylaws an uncontested election is an election in which the number of nominees for director is not greater than the number of directors to be elected and a contested election is an election in which the number of nominees for director is greater than the number of directors to be elected what happens if a director nominee does not receive a majority vote in an uncontested election at the

abstain with respect to any proposal is considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal but is not considered a vote cast with respect to that proposal therefore an abstention will not have any effect on the election of directors because each of the other proposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote on each

company since we separate these roles in recognition of the differences between the two roles and the value to our company of having the distinct and different perspectives and experiences of a separate chairman and ceo as specified in our bylaws our ceo is responsible for the general management supervision and control of the business and affairs of our company and ensuring that all orders and resolutions of the board are carried into effect our chairman on the other hand is charged with presiding over all meetings of the board and our shareholders and providing advice and counsel to the ceo and our companys other officers regarding our business and operations by separating the roles of ceo and chairman our ceo is able to focus his time and energy on managing walmarts complex daily operations while our chairman can devote his time and attention to addressing matters relating to the responsibilities of our board our ceo and chairman have an excellent working relationship and with over years of experience with walmart our chairman is well positioned to provide our ceo with guidance advice and counsel regarding our companys business operations and strategy moreover we believe that having a separate chairman focused on oversight and governance matters allows the board to more effectively perform its risk oversight role described below in connection with the boards annual self evaluation process as required by our corporate governance guidelines the board evaluates its organization and processes to ensure that the board is functioning effectively for the foregoing reasons we believe that our separate ceo chairman structure is the most appropriate and effective leadership structure for our company and our shareholders the boards role in risk oversight the audit committee reviews and discusses with management the companys processes and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management including the companys enterprise wide risk management program in addition the companys risk oversight process involves the board receiving information from management on a variety of matters including operations legal regulatory finance reputation and strategy as well as information regarding any material risks associated with each matter the full board or the appropriate board committee if the board committee is responsible for the oversight of the matter receives this information through updates from the appropriate members of management to enable it to understand monitor and give direction with respect to the companys risk management practices in addition when a board committee receives an update the chairperson of the relevant board committee reports on the discussion to the full board during the board committee reports portion

will vote the shares as to which they hold proxies in their discretion executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis executive summary in the following pages we discuss how our ceo cfo and certain other executive officers our named executive officers or neos were compensated in fiscal february through january and describe how this compensation fits within our executive compensation philosophy our financial performance for fiscal was solid our earnings were in the top half of our annual guidance provided at the beginning of fiscal when our incentive goals were set the walmart us segment delivered positive comparable store sales for the fiscal year and walmart us sales improved over the course of the year with consecutive fiscal quarters of positive comparable store sales in the third and fourth quarters walmart international continues to deliver strong growth and sams club sustained its momentum with continued strong sales and operating income our company continued to leverage expenses and our return on investment roi continued to be relatively stable with roi for fiscal moderately less than the prior fiscal year primarily due to additional investments in property plant and equipment global ecommerce and higher inventories as well as investments in price our stock price increased more than percent during fiscal and we paid dividends of per share during the fiscal year for a total of approximately billion in dividends we also returned an additional billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases the key financial measures on which our incentive compensation plans are based are operating income sales and roi despite our strong earnings performance and relatively stable returns in fiscal with the exception of our sams club division our overall fiscal performance was below the challenging goals established by the cngc for our executive compensation plans in which our neos participate in particular with the exception of sams club our operating income fell short of the target performance goals under our cash incentive plan and our sales and roi fell short of the target performance goals under our long term equity incentive program this performance directly impacted our neos compensation for fiscal in particular each of our neos earned a cash incentive payment that was below target for fiscal and our ceos cash incentive payment was approximately percent less than his cash incentive payment for the prior fiscal year similarly with the exception of mr brianc cornell who was responsible for our sams club segment in fiscal our neos long term equity incentive payout for fiscal was reduced because we determine long term equity payouts based on performance over three years these payouts will be reduced for the next two fiscal years as well our compensation program emphasizes performance our total direct compensation tdc packages for neos comprising base salary annual cash incentives and long term equity are heavily weighted towards performance base salary represents less than percent of each neos target tdc opportunity approximately percent for the ceo and a substantial majority at least percent of each neos target tdc opportunity is contingent on meeting operating income sales and roi goals that we believe have a meaningful impact on shareholder value our neos annual cash incentive is based primarily on the operating income of our company and or one or more operating divisions depending on each neos responsibilities our long term performance share program is based on total company roi and the sales performance of one or more operating divisions depending on each neos area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and the balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating divisions drives financial performance and shareholder value and mitigates the risk that our executives will overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of our company as a whole in addition our executive compensation program seeks to balance long term and annual performance our annual cash incentive plan is primarily based on operating income during a single fiscal year while our long term performance share program is based on sales and roi over a three year period with performance goals set annually and payouts table of contents based on the average performance against these goals during each of the three years our executives also receive service based restricted stock restricted stock granted in january as part of our neos annual equity awards vests on the third anniversary of the grant date along with performance shares restricted stock gives our neos ownership in the company as well as serving as a retention tool the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation programs to ensure that compensation is competitive but remains closely tied to performance that can be impacted by our executives and that the cngc believes is aligned with shareholder value in addition the cngc ensures that the goals and objectives of our performance based compensation plans are challenging in light of the expectations of and our commitments to our shareholders and other stakeholders as well as the internal expectations of the board and our company our incentive plans during fiscal the compensation earned by our neos for fiscal shows that our incentive plans are working as designed while our fiscal earnings performance was strong our total company operating income was below the fiscal target goals under our annual cash incentive plan as a result our ceos cash incentive payment for fiscal was approximately million which was significantly less than his target payout of million this compares to a cash incentive payment of million to our ceo for fiscal and a maximum cash incentive payment of million to our ceo for fiscal with respect to our long term performance share program our roi remained relatively stable but was below the target performance goal under this plan and our sales performance also fell short of our target performance goals under this plan with the exception of sams club which exceeded its sales goals for fiscal under this plan as a result with respect to the portion of performance shares dependent on fiscal performance our ceo earned approximately percent less than his target opportunity compared to approximately percent less than his target opportunity earned in fiscal and approximately percent above target earned in fiscal because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only did this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but it will also adversely impact our ceos performance share payouts for fiscal and fiscal who are the named executive officers covered in this proxy statement for fiscal our neos were michael t duke president and ceo mr duke joined our company in and has served in a number of positions prior to becoming president and ceo in february charles m holley jr executive vice president and cfo mr holley joined our company in and was promoted to cfo on december william s simon executive vice president president and ceo walmart us mr simon joined our company in and was promoted to his present position on june c douglas mcmillon executive vice president president and ceo walmart international mr mcmillon joined our company in and was promoted to his current position in february brian c cornell former executive vice president president and ceo sams club mr cornell joined our company in and resigned as president and ceo of sams club on january mr cornell remained as an executive vice president of our company in a transitional role through march neil m ashe executive vice president president and ceo global ecommerce mr ashe joined our company on january mr ashe joined our company less than one month before the end of fiscal however because mr ashe received his initial annual equity award in january prior to the end of fiscal mr ashe is an neo for fiscal due primarily to the value of this annual equity award mr ashe did not receive a cash incentive payout or a long term performance share payout for fiscal we have voluntarily included mr cornell as a neo because he led our sams club segment during fiscal table of contents impact of fiscal performance on executive compensation how was walmarts fiscal performance reflected in our executive compensation cash incentive plan while our fiscal earnings performance was strong operating income for the total company as well as for the walmart us and international segments was below the fiscal target performance goals under our annual cash incentive plan as a result our ceos cash incentive payment for fiscal was less than the target payout with the exception of mr ashe who was not eligible for a cash incentive payout for fiscal each of our other neos also received a cash incentive payout that was below target moreover because our growth in operating income during fiscal was not as strong relative to our performance goals as it was in the prior two years our neos earned less under our annual cash incentive plan for fiscal than for each of the prior two years with the exception of mr simon whose payout percentage was slightly higher and whose cash incentive opportunity was greater in fiscal than in prior years as described below the following table compares our fiscal fiscal and fiscal payouts under our cash incentive plan company division fiscal cashincentive payout of target fiscal cashincentive payout of target fiscal cashincentive payout of target total company walmart us international sams club as a result our neos who continued in the same positions with the same cash incentive opportunities earned a smaller cash incentive payment for fiscal as compared to the previous two fiscal years for example our ceo earned a cash incentive payment for fiscal that was almost million less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal and approximately million less than his cash incentive payment for fiscal when he received a maximum payout under the plan michael t duke cash incentive fiscal year of target cash incentivepayment performance shares with respect to our long term performance share program our roi was below the target performance goal under our long term incentive plan our sales performance for the total company and the walmart us and international divisions also fell short of our target performance goals under this plan as a result as shown in the table below we fell short of our target performance share goals applicable to each of our neos with the exception of mr cornell who was responsible for our sams club operations because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only did this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but it will also adversely impact our neos performance share payouts for fiscal and fiscal performance shares company division performancevs fiscal goals of target performancevs fiscal goals of target performancevs fiscal goals of target total company walmart us international sams club as a result of our fiscal performance the combined value of mr dukes performance share payouts for fiscal fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million less than if we had reached our target performance share goals for fiscal assuming a stock price of per share which was the closing price of shares on the nyse on january actual performance share payouts to our neos for the three year period ended january are shown below on page table of contents fiscal performance measures and performance goals what performance metrics were used in our executive compensation program for fiscal commensurate with the cngcs philosophy our neos fiscal tdc was substantially performance based each neos performance measures are based on the performance of our total company or a combination of the performance of our total company and the neos operating division this approach is consistent with our objective of compensating officers based on performance within their control or influence while still tying a significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company to drive the companys business strategies the performance measures applicable to our neos fiscal compensation were element of compensation fiscal performance metrics performanceperiod annual cash incentive operating income total company and or division performance shares total company return on investment total company sales for mr duke and mr holley walmart us sales for mr simon international sales for mr mcmillon sams club sales for mr cornell for purposes of the performance shares we define return on investment which is a non gaap measure as defined in the secs rules as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight the cngc chose these performance measures to align with the companys strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns the cngc concluded that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to incentivize our executives to achieve performance that is in line with the best interests of our company and our shareholders in addition the cngc believes that the combination and weighting of these performance metrics help to mitigate the risk that our executives would be motivated to pursue results with respect to one metric to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts what were our specific performance targets for fiscal and how did we perform in comparison to these targets in determining actual performance for purposes of our performance based plans the cngc made certain positive and negative adjustments to our reported results as provided by the terms of the applicable plans these adjustments are intended to enable results for a particular fiscal year to be computed on a comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our incentive plans reward underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives for fiscal operating income and roi were adjusted to exclude the net effect of recent acquisitions currency exchange rate fluctuations natural disaster related costs the sale of real estate in brazil and certain other items that were not material in the aggregate or individually and sales growth was adjusted to exclude the effects of fuel sales by our international and sams club segments currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions the adjustments to operating income had the effect of reducing the fiscal cash incentive payments earned by our neos table of

ashe not applicable a portion of each neos cash incentive payment is also subject to satisfying diversity objectives and each neos cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not satisfy these objectives for fiscal these objectives consisted of two components good faith efforts and placements each of our neos is subject to good faith efforts requirements in order to satisfy the good faith efforts component of this program each neo must actively sponsor at least two associates and must also participate in at least two diversity related events each of our neos with responsibility for our walmart us and or sams club field operations are also subject to placement objectives for fiscal messrs duke simon and cornell were subject to placement objectives the determination as to whether an neo satisfies his or her placement objectives is based on several factors including the relative number of diverse candidates placed in specified positions within the neos organization the neo demonstrating engagement and participation in a diversity and inclusion strategy the neos leadership efforts in implementing these strategies and the neos efforts in recruiting and developing diverse associates applying these factors at the end of each fiscal year our chief diversity officer reviews each neos performance under our diversity program and reports the results of this review to the cngc prior to the approval of annual cash incentive payouts to our neos based on the report of our chief diversity officer the cngc determined that each neo satisfied his

not applicable components of fiscal compensation and pay mix what are the other components of our neos compensation in addition to the annual cash incentive and long term performance shares described above our neos also receive a base salary and a service based restricted stock award these four elements comprise each neos total direct compensation or tdc consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance the value of each neos annual restricted stock award is one third the target value of the neos performance share award table of contents how much of our neos tdc was performance based in fiscal for fiscal base salary represented less than percent of each neos target tdc opportunity and a substantial majority of each neos target tdc opportunity was comprised of an annual cash incentive and performance shares that is compensation that is contingent on satisfying a balance of performance measures that we believe have a meaningful impact on shareholder value as shown in the following charts mr ashe is not included above because he joined our company at the end of fiscal what other types of compensation did our neos receive for fiscal our neos may from time to time receive special awards special awards are typically granted for retention purposes or in recognition of extraordinary performance because these awards are not part of an neos annual compensation the special awards are not included in tdc in march the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for mr cornell in the amount of million in order for mr cornell to earn this award sams club total sales excluding fuel had to increase by at least percent during fiscal the purpose of this award was to emphasize the importance of continued strong sales performance during fiscal total sales for sams club excluding fuel increased by approximately percent as a result mr cornell earned the award in full the special performance based cash award is included on the summary compensation table in mr cornells fiscal compensation since it was earned for that period what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations for our neos we provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a limited number of hours each table of contents year our neos also receive company paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance our neos also are entitled to benefits available to officers generally such as participation in the deferred compensation plan and benefits available to associates generally including a walmart discount card a limited percent match of purchases of shares through our stock purchase plan participation in the k plan medical benefits and foreign business travel insurance we provide these perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives fiscal total direct compensation opportunity what was the tdc for the neos in fiscal and the other years covered in the summary compensation table the following table shows the tdc established for each neo for the fiscal years reported on the summary compensation table rounded to the nearest thousand as shown in the table below target tdc represents the amounts our neos would receive if target performance goals are achieved maximum tdc represents the amounts that our neos would receive if maximum performance goals are achieved and is therefore intended to reflect the amounts our neos would receive only in the event of exceptional performance named executive officer fiscalyear basesalary annual cash incentive total cash equity tdc target max target max target max target max michael t duke charles m holley jr william s simon c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell neil m ashe n a as described above because our overall performance during fiscal was not as strong as our performance during the prior two fiscal years our continuing neos realized less of their tdc opportunity during fiscal as compared to prior fiscal years why is tdc different than the amounts shown in the summary compensation table inclusion of the tdc table above is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the cngcs decision making process when establishing neo compensation the summary compensation table that appears on page provides specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal years for our neos in the manner required by sec rules the amounts in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation opportunities approved by the cngc for our neos nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation that may actually be earned by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance conditions for example because the cngc typically grants annual equity awards to our neos prior to the start of the fiscal year the equity awards granted for fiscal appear on the summary compensation table as part of fiscal compensation as noted above mr ashe received equity awards in january that are included on the summary compensation table for fiscal but are intended as part of mr ashes fiscal tdc table of contents what were the significant changes to our neos compensation for fiscal there were no significant changes to the basic tdc structure for neos in fiscal after including a walmart us sales component in mr simons cash incentive award in fiscal mr simons cash incentive for fiscal was based on operating income as it is for our other senior executives and most management associates generally in making this change the cngc recognized that a significant portion of mr simons tdc is already dependent on walmart us sales by means of our long term performance share program for fiscal our neos received base salary increases ranging from approximately percent to approximately percent which is consistent with annual base salary increases for management associates generally for fiscal mr simons target cash incentive award increased from percent to percent of his base salary this increase reflected mr simons continued experience in his leadership role and was intended to align mr simons cash incentive opportunity with other internal leaders and external peer groups how is tdc allocated between annual and long term compensation a majority of each neos fiscal tdc was allocated to performance shares which have a three year performance period an additional portion of fiscal tdc was allocated to restricted stock which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date the following charts illustrate this allocation for our ceo and for our other neos as a group the percentages may not total due to rounding we believe that this mix appropriately balances annual and long term performance executive compensation philosophy and process who establishes the tdc at walmart the cngc is the board committee that is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the officers subject to section including the ceo and other neos the members of the cngc are independent see pages and for more information on the cngc the cngc met seven times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance metrics and performance goals applicable to the neos performance based compensation and the review of performance against those metrics what is the companys compensation philosophy in establishing tdc the companys philosophy is that a substantial portion of tdc should be tied to performance that drives the companys business strategies and that each neo can impact this philosophy focuses on the long term interests of table of contents shareholders and seeks to align the interests of the neos with the companys continued growth and long term performance goals applying this philosophy the cngc designs the executive compensation program to provide fair competitive compensation based on performance and contributions to the company provide incentives to attract and retain key executives instill a long term commitment to the company and develop a sense of company ownership how does the cngc establish tdc the process of setting tdc is a dynamic one the cngc considers among other things the overall financial and operating performance of our company and operating segments as applicable each neos individual performance and contributions to the achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future the peer group data and analyses see pages for more detail and the results of recent shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation generally our neos target tdc which would be earned if target performance goals are achieved place the neos in the top quartile of the peer groups for their respective positions the cngc believes that it is generally appropriate to position our neos target tdc at this level because as the worlds largest retailer the companys size extensive international presence and complex operations result in our neo jobs having a greater level of complexity than similar jobs at many of our peer group companies the target tdc opportunity for a new executive may be less than the top quartile of the peer groups depending on a number of factors particularly time and experience in a similar role in evaluating individual performance the cngc relied on annual performance evaluations for each neo and discussions with the neos supervisor the differences in tdc among our neos are due to many factors these factors include the differences in job scope and responsibilities the cngcs review of peer group compensation information through peer benchmarking expertise and years of experience historical compensation levels retention and succession considerations and individual and where relevant divisional performance the tdc levels set forth in the table on page represent the cngcs judgment as to the appropriate compensation opportunities in light of these factors how is tdc allocated among the various elements of compensation base salary in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates a relatively small percentage of tdc to base salary because our more senior executives typically have a large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of tdc attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our executives advance in our company annual cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment the target opportunity for the annual cash incentive is based on a percentage of base salary the cash incentive payout can range from percent of the target opportunity at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target opportunity for example our ceos target opportunity is percent of his base salary and he can earn a cash incentive from percent of his base salary at threshold to a maximum of percent of his base salary the cash incentive earned depends on whether we achieve pre established performance goals and no payout will be made unless the threshold performance goals are met the cngc sets the performance goals in the first quarter of the fiscal year long term equity awards the balance of tdc generally the largest portion is then allocated between two forms of long term equity compensation we believe that long term equity awards help align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders as well as providing a retention tool consistent with our philosophy of tying table of contents compensation to performance percent of the annual equity award is in the form of performance shares with the remaining percent granted in the form of restricted stock performance shares a performance share award gives the officer receiving it the right to receive a number of shares if we meet certain performance goals during a specified performance period generally performance shares granted to our executives have a three year performance period with the performance metrics set annually by the cngc the number of shares received at payout is based on the average performance as compared to these performance metrics over three fiscal years the neos can earn from percent at threshold to a maximum of percent of the target number of shares restricted stock the remaining percent of the equity value is in the form of restricted stock which for annual awards granted in fiscal vests on the third anniversary of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting date how does the cngc set performance goals the goals for our performance based plans are established in light of the operating plans for our company and each of its operating segments the companys operating plans to reach our strategic goals are reviewed by the board in light of economic conditions in our industry and in the broader markets in which we operate the companys operating plans are generally intended to be challenging and fiscal was no exception particularly given the economic environment for our core customer in order to achieve the target goals in our performance based plans our company and operating segments must perform in line with our sales operating income and return on investment expectations and operating plans at the time the goals were set in order to achieve the maximum goals the performance of our company and operating segments would have to exceed those expectations to a significant degree generally goals for our international division require greater increases in operating income and sales relative to our other divisions this reflects our strategic growth plans for our international operations in light of market conditions and the level of capital investment required for growth in the international markets in which we operate the cngc generally attempts to set the threshold and maximum performance goals so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the cngc generally establishes the maximum performance goals at a level that would represent superior performance for the company and the threshold performance goals at a level that is attainable but below which the company could not justify a payment do our neos receive any compensation that is not included in tdc on occasion we grant our officers including our neos special awards that are not included in tdc these awards are generally in the form of performance based restricted stock or service based restricted stock and are intended for retention purposes and or to reward exceptional performance also the cngc may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual neos cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target payout for that neo based upon the cngcs subjective evaluation of that neos individual performance the cngc did not increase or decrease any neos cash incentive payment for fiscal mr cornell received a special performance based cash award of million based on sams club performance during fiscal which is described above on page our neos also receive limited perquisites and other benefits as described above on pages in january the cngc approved a special performance based cash award opportunity for mr simon in the amount of million half of this award is contingent on meeting performance goals for fiscal and half is contingent on meeting performance goals for fiscal in march the cngc established a performance goal for fiscal applicable to this award the cngc will establish a performance goal or goals for the portion of this award contingent on fiscal performance at a later date the purpose of this award was to allow the cngc the ability to set separate strategic goals for mr simon which for fiscal is to continue to emphasize the importance of sales growth and for retention purposes also in january the cngc approved a million special restricted stock award to mr mcmillon primarily for retention purposes one half of this award will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and the other half will vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date provided that mr mcmillon continues to be employed by walmart through the vesting dates finally as is customary for new officer hires in january the cngc approved two performance share awards to mr ashe that were in addition to his annual performance share award that is scheduled table of contents to vest on january these additional performance share awards are scheduled to vest on january and january respectively and each has a target value of million which is equal to the target value of his annual performance share award in addition as described above our neos receive other benefits generally available to our associates such as participation in our k plan our stock purchase plan and other plans available to our officers such as our deferred compensation plan our neos also receive certain perquisites and supplemental benefits described above other compensation considerations are there any significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged in march the cngc established performance metrics and goals for the fiscal performance based plans for fiscal our executive incentive compensation programs continue to be based on sales operating income and roi metrics what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations of these neos provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our global people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews his annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc when establishing and approving the compensation of our ceo our chairman with support from our global people division and the chair of the cngc reviews our ceos performance evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation since early the cngc has engaged an independent consultant on executive compensation matters since early pay governance llc pay governance has been engaged by the cngc as its independent executive compensation consultant under the terms of its engagement pay governance reports directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc has sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of pay governance and pay governance may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting services to walmart without the approval of the cngc other than its engagement by the cngc pay governance does not perform any services for walmart the cngcs independent consultant attends and participates in cngc meetings at which executive compensation matters are considered and performs analyses for the cngc at the cngcs request including benchmarking realizable pay analysis analysis of the correlation between performance metrics and shareholder return and assessments of the difficulty of performance goals how is peer group data used by the cngc our company is the worlds largest retailer by a wide margin and has significantly more extensive international operations than most publicly traded u s based retailers as a result the cngc believes that simply benchmarking neo compensation against a retail industry index would not provide the cngc with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our neos therefore the cngc reviews publicly available information for three peer groups to determine how our neos compensation compares to the compensation paid to executives in comparable positions at other companies since information regarding positions comparable to those of some of our neos is not available for many of the companies in our peer groups using three peer groups results in a larger number of comparable positions to which our neos compensation can be benchmarked the cngc uses benchmarking data when allocating each neos tdc among the various elements of compensation as a general guide to ensure that the amount of tdc allocated to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation we did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them while the benchmarking data is generally used for comparable positions the cngc also reviews peer group data for retail ceo positions for our executives who lead our operating divisions these roles have significant responsibilities and the cngc believes that these positions are often comparable to ceo positions at many of our table of contents peer group companies in addition from a competitive standpoint it is more likely that our operating segment leaders would be recruited for a ceo position rather than a lateral move therefore we benchmark these executives compensation against that of ceos within our retail peer groups retail industry survey this survey allows us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary competitors in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly traded retail companies with significant u s operations with annual revenues exceeding approximately billion which were amazon com inc autonation inc best buy co inc bjs wholesale club inc costco wholesale corporation cvs caremark corporation dollar general corporation the gap inc the home depot inc j c penney company inc kohls corporation the kroger co lowes companies inc macys inc office

quartile of tdcs for peer positions within the retail industry survey when compared to ceo positions within the retail industry survey mr mcmillons target tdc was between the th and th percentile and mr simons and mr cornells target tdcs were between the th and th percentiles select fortune we also benchmark our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by our global people division with input by the cngcs independent consultant the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we excluded retailers from this group because those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also excluded companies with business models that are broadly divergent from ours such as financial institutions and energy companies the companies included in the select fortune when setting fiscal compensation were archer daniels midland company att inc caterpillar inc cisco systems inc the coca cola company dell inc fedex corporation ford

terms of market capitalization than the retail industry survey at the median to take into account this size discrepancy and the corresponding complexity of our neos job responsibilities we also

positions within this survey group what other information does the cngc consider when establishing tdc the cngc also reviews other information in the process of setting tdc although the cngc generally considers these factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized compensation the cngc also reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years the cngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys global people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation at the annual shareholders meeting for the first time walmarts shareholders had an opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve our neos compensation at the annual shareholders meeting approximately percent of the votes cast on this proposal were voted to approve our neos compensation while this vote was not held until after the cngc had established our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal the cngc believes that the results of this vote affirms shareholders support of our companys approach to executive compensation which as described above has not changed significantly since fiscal the cngc considered that support when establishing our neos compensation opportunities for fiscal based on the recommendation of the board our shareholders also voted overwhelmingly in favor of an annual advisory vote to approve our neo compensation and we have determined to hold such a vote annually the cngc will continue to consider the outcome of these annual advisory votes when making future compensation decisions for our neos table of contents what are our practices for granting stock options and other equity awards option exercise prices we did not grant any stock options to our neos during fiscal and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances when we grant stock options the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our neos for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance shares and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible unless it is performance based a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos satisfies the requirements for deductibility under section m when designing neo compensation the cngc considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes the cngc retains the ability to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws similarly the cngc generally has the ability to require an neo to defer into the future compensation that is not deductible under federal tax laws do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos all neos are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period following his termination of employment he will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment in this context a competing business generally means any retail wholesale or merchandising business with revenues over certain thresholds that sells products of the type sold by walmart in addition mr ashes agreement prohibits him from working for a global ecommerce company these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company we do not have any contracts or other arrangements with our neos that provide for payments or other benefits upon a change in control of our company we did not pay mr cornell any severance in connection with his departure from our company however mr cornell continues to be subject to the non compete obligations described in the previous paragraph see potential payments upon termination or change in control on page for more information what types of retirement and other benefits are our neos eligible for our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our k plan our neos do not participate in any pension or other defined benefit retirement plan table of contents does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or nonpayment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our cash incentive plan provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the participant must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of our stock to further align the long term interests of our executives and our shareholders the board has approved the following stock ownership guidelines our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to five times his current annual base salary and each of our other executive officers and certain other officers must beginning on the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to a position covered by the stock ownership guidelines maintain beneficial ownership of unrestricted shares equal in market value to three times his or her current annual base salary if any covered officer is not in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines he or she may not sell or otherwise dispose of more than percent of any shares that vest pursuant to any equity award during any period for which he or she is not in compliance with such guidelines until such time as he or she is in compliance with the guidelines and such sale would not cause the covered officer to cease to be in compliance with the guidelines the board or the cngc can modify these guidelines in the event of dramatic and unexpected changes in the market value of our shares or in other circumstances that the board or the cngc deems appropriate currently each of our neos is in compliance with our ownership guidelines are there any restrictions on the ability of neos to engage in speculative transactions involving company stock yes other than pursuant to a rule b plan that has been approved by our legal department our insider trading policy allows neos to trade in our stock only during open window periods and only after they have pre cleared transactions moreover neos may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange traded puts or calls or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share program we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures namely earnings related measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts table of contents maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share program are capped at percent and percent of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking because the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe incentivize our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company table

independent accountants to audit the consolidated financial statements of the company for fiscal ey and its predecessor arthur young company have been walmarts independent accountants since prior to

representatives of ey will attend the annual shareholders meeting they will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate questions although shareholder ratification is not required the appointment of ey as the companys independent accountants for fiscal is being submitted for ratification at the annual shareholders meeting because the board believes it is a matter of good corporate governance practice furthermore the audit committee will take shareholders opinions regarding eys appointment into consideration in future deliberations if eys selection is not ratified at the annual shareholders meeting the audit committee will consider the engagement of other independent accountants the audit committee may terminate eys engagement as the companys independent accountants without the approval of the companys shareholders whenever the audit committee deems termination appropriate eys fees for fiscal and fiscal were as follows

promulgated by the sec for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote for the ratification of ey as the companys independent accountants for fiscal proposal no advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation section a of the exchange act and related sec rules now require that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve on a non binding advisory basis the compensation of our neos as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with sec rules we must provide this opportunity to our shareholders at least once every three years however following the recommendation of our shareholders our board has chosen to hold this vote every year as described above under compensation discussion and analysis our executive compensation program is designed with an emphasis on performance and is intended to closely align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that compensation is closely tied to aspects of our companys performance that our executive officers can impact and that is likely to have an impact on shareholder value our compensation programs are also designed to balance long term performance with shorter term performance and to mitigate any risk that an executive officer would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single performance metric or operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole in the compensation discussion and analysis referred to above we discuss why we believe the compensation of our neos for fiscal properly reflected our companys performance in fiscal we urge you to read carefully the compensation discussion and analysis the compensation tables and the related narrative discussion in this proxy statement the vote on this proposal is advisory which means that the vote will not be binding on walmart the board or the cngc the cngc will review and consider the results of the vote on this proposal in connection with its regular evaluations of our executive compensation program in view of the foregoing shareholders will vote on the following resolution at the annual shareholders meeting resolved that the companys shareholders hereby approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the named executive officers of walmart as disclosed in walmarts proxy statement for the annual shareholders meeting in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions compensation disclosure rules the board recommends that shareholders vote for this proposal table of contents shareholder proposals our company has received notice of the intention of shareholders to present three separate proposals for voting at the annual shareholders meeting the text of the shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received by our company unless otherwise noted all statements contained in a shareholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to wal mart stores inc c o lynn hancock senior liaison to the board of directors southwest th street bentonville arkansas some of the shareholder proposals contain assertions about walmart or other matters that our company believes are incorrect but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions in our statements of opposition following these proposals the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals based on broader policy reasons as set forth in walmarts statements in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no political contributions report resolved that the shareholders of wal mart stores inc wal mart or company hereby request that the company provide a report updated semi annually disclosing the amounts that the company has paid or incurred in connection with influencing legislation participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office and attempting to influence the general public or segments thereof with respect to elections legislative matters or referenda the report should include a contributions to or expenditures on behalf of political candidates political parties political committees and other political entities and b the portions of any dues or other payments that are made to a tax exempt organization for an expenditure or contribution that if made directly by the company would not be deductible under section e of the internal revenue code the report should identify each recipient the amount paid to each and the purpose of any contribution or expenditure stockholder supporting statement as long term shareholders of wal mart we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on lobbying and political activities the expenditures upon which we seek a report are those that congress has said do not warrant a deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense namely lobbying participation in the political system by supporting or opposing candidates for office and trying to influence the general public or segment thereof as to elections legislative matters or referenda this includes payments to third parties including trade associations and other tax exempt groups which payments are used for expenditures that would not be deductible if made by the company itself disclosure is consistent with public policy and we believe in the best interest of the company and its shareholders the supreme courts citizens united decision recognized the importance of political spending disclosure when it said d isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way this transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages gaps in transparency and accountability may expose the company to reputational and business risks that could threaten long term shareholder value moreover publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the companys lobbying or political expenditures thus the companys payments to trade associations for these purposes are undisclosed and unknown as are any payments to tax exempt groups that work to influence legislation and political campaigns as well as public opinion that could affect legislation or elections the sums involved can be significant a bloomberg story reported that several health insurers donated million to the u s chamber of commerce in for advertisements polling and grassroots events to drum up opposition to health care reform legislation a former federal election commission chairman described this figure as breathtaking we believe that shareholders need improved disclosure in order to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets on these activities thus we urge you to vote for this critical governance reform table of contents walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political contributions consistent with the federal state and local laws governing such contributions we are fully committed to complying with all laws concerning political contributions including laws requiring public disclosure federal law currently prohibits corporations from making contributions directly to candidates for federal office and to national party committees as a result walmart does not make such contributions some of our associates voluntarily fund a political action committee wal pac that makes political contributions to state and federal candidates political party committees and or political action committees the activities of wal pac are subject to comprehensive regulation by the federal government including detailed disclosure requirements wal pac files monthly reports of receipts and disbursements with the federal election commission the fec as well as pre election and post election fec reports all political contributions over are shown in public information made available by the fec under the lobbying disclosure act of as amended walmart submits to congress quarterly reports which also are publicly available at the state level both walmarts and wal pacs political contributions also are subject to regulation although some states have not banned corporate contributions to candidates or political parties all states require that such contributions be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available as a result of the disclosures mandated by law the board has concluded that ample disclosure exists regarding our political contributions to alleviate the concerns cited in this proposal in addition the board believes that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution would place our company at a competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business strategies and priorities we are also involved in a number of legislative initiatives that could dramatically affect our business and operations because parties with adverse interests also participate in the political process for their own business reasons any unilaterally expanded disclosure by walmart regarding its political contributions or payments to trade associations and other tax exempt groups could benefit these parties to the detriment of walmart and its shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no director nomination policy resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors the board to adopt a policy that the board based on the compensation nominating and governance committees recommendation will nominate at least one director for election at each walmart annual shareholders meeting at which directors are elected who a is a current or retired executive officer of a company government agency or non profit organization in the healthcare sector and b has significant experience in patient safety and quality issues the policy should be implemented prospectively and in a manner that does not interfere with the service of any incumbent director or violate any contractual obligation compliance should be excused if walmarts board becomes classified supporting statement as long term investors in walmart we are concerned that the competencies of walmarts board members do not reflect the companys increasing focus on pharmacy and other healthcare services the descriptions of directors qualifications in the and proxy statements do not reflect experience

oversee we agree with deloittes corporate governance center that a proactive approach to board composition one that focuses on the companys future is most effective creating the board your company deserves at available at www corpgov deloitte com we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no as previously discussed in this proxy statement under the heading nomination process for director candidates the cngc engages in a rigorous and dynamic process for identifying and evaluating potential candidates and recommending candidates to the board for nomination for election to the board in discharging its duties to identify qualified and diverse candidates for the board the cngc regularly reviews the composition of the board and its committees and determines whether the addition of one or more directors with particular experience skills or characteristics would make the board and its committees more effective to that end the cngc engages spencerstuart the companys director candidate search consultant to seek out candidates who have the experience skills and characteristics that the cngc has determined as necessary to serve as an effective member of the board as also previously explained in this proxy statement candidates for nomination to the board are selected on the basis of outstanding achievement in their professional careers broad experience wisdom personal and professional integrity ability to make independent analytical inquiries experience with and understanding of the business environment willingness and ability to devote adequate time to board duties and such other experience attributes and skills that the cngc may determine as qualifying candidates for service on the board ultimately when assessing a potential candidate the cngc and the board consider the different viewpoints and experiences that a candidate could bring to the board and how those viewpoints and experiences could enhance the boards execution of its responsibilities the cngc and the board recognize the importance of healthcare related services and products to our customers as well as the importance of many other services and products to our customers our board and the audit committee are fully engaged with management regarding the companys processes and policies with respect to risk assessment and management including any potential risks pertaining to healthcare related services and products offered by our company we believe however that adopting the policy described in this shareholder proposal would unduly limit the ability of the cngc and the board to review and select potential nominees who in their judgment have the combination of experience skills and characteristics that are best suited to oversee the companys complex global business operations and oversee the company and its management in achieving the companys strategic priorities and evolving business objectives further shareholders already have an adequate means for recommending candidates for nomination to the board whom shareholders believe have certain experience skills or expertise that might benefit the company and its shareholders as described under the heading nomination process for director candidates in this proxy statement shareholders may follow the listed procedures to recommend candidates for nomination for election to the board who meet the minimum qualifications for a director candidate as described in this proxy statement all shareholder recommendations of potential board candidates are submitted to the cngc for its review analysis and consideration table of contents and candidates who are recommended by shareholders and who meet the minimum qualifications described in the proxy statement will be evaluated by the cngc on the same basis as all other director candidates for the above reasons the board recommends that the shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no report regarding incentive compensation programs resolved that shareholders of wal mart stores inc walmart urge the board of directors the board to adopt a policy that the compensation nominating and governance committee the committee will annually analyze and report to shareholders at reasonable expense and omitting proprietary information on whether walmarts incentive compensation plans and programs considered together provide appropriate incentives to discourage senior executives from making investments that result in declining rates of return on investment taking into account the following over the previous three years the relationship between growth in invested capital and growth in operating income trends in return on investment roi the relationship between same store sales growth also known as comparable store sales and total sales growth the adjustments made to walmarts reported results in connection with the measurement of performance for performance based plans and the extent to which sales at stores open for more than one year declined because of sales at newly opened stores the cannibalization rate supporting statement as walmart employees and long term shareholders we believe that incentive compensation plans and programs for senior executives should encourage sustainable value creation we are concerned that recent decisions by the committee may overemphasize sales growth even when that growth is resulting in declining rates of return on investment and in some cases does not produce returns that cover the cost of capital specifically the replacement of same store sales growtha metric walmart has repeatedly touted as critically importantwith total sales growth as the sales metric under walmarts performance share program risks encouraging senior executives to invest in new stores even if doing so leads to cannibalization of existing stores sales and lower returns on investment during fiscal years and same store sales and total sales growth moved in opposite directions and since the growth in invested capital has been significantly greater than the growth in operating income reinforcing our concerns we also note that based on walmarts disclosures the rate of cannibalization increased significantly from approximately in to in walmart asserts in its proxy statement that the use of operating income growth for the annual incentive plan balances the sales and roi metrics used in the long term plan the operating income measure is adjusted to ensure that walmarts incentive plans reward underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of walmarts executives proxy statement at we disagree however that at least one adjustment listed in the proxyaccruals for litigation settlementsis beyond the control of walmarts senior executives this proposal asks the board to commit to a policy that the committee will annually analyze and report to shareholders on whether incentive compensation arrangements encourage investments that result in declining returns on investment taking into account specified factors in our view requiring such an analysis and report will focus the committee on ensuring that incentives for senior executives promote long term value creation for shareholders we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the cngc is responsible for among other things establishing and verifying the attainment of performance goals under our performance based incentive compensation plans the members of the cngc discharge this responsibility with a high degree of care and professionalism reviewing executive compensation matters including incentive compensation matters at multiple meetings throughout the year for example in fiscal the cngc considered executive compensation matters including the selection of performance metrics and performance goals applicable to table of contents our senior executives performance based compensation and the review of the companys performance against those metrics at seven separate meetings the cngc analyzes the companys incentive compensation programs and the behavior encouraged by those programs far more frequently than is requested by this shareholder proposal we believe that our incentive compensation programs provide appropriate incentives to our senior executives to manage the company in a manner that will help us achieve our strategic priorities of growth leverage and returns and therefore maximize shareholder value as discussed in the cda included in this proxy statement and in previous proxy statements the cngc has concluded that the design of our performance based incentive compensation programs strikes an appropriate balance between rewarding both annual and long term performance and mitigates the risk that our senior executives will make decisions that overemphasize any single performance metric to the detriment of the company as a whole reflecting the balanced approach taken in our incentive compensation programs return on investment roi is a key performance measure used in determining the amount of incentive compensation our neos receive through our long term performance share plan even a slight fluctuation in roi performance can lead to a meaningful reduction in our neos performance share based incentive compensation as explained in the cda included in this proxy statement we fell short of our target roi goal under our long term incentive plan this resulted with the exception of one of our neos in our neos falling short of target performance under our performance share plan in fiscal further because we average three separate years of performance to determine the three year payout under our performance share program not only did this result in a lower performance share payout for fiscal but it will also impact our neos performance share payouts for fiscal and fiscal as well the importance of roi performance to our neos total compensation is described in the narrative in the cda and is clearly depicted in charts included in the cda in this proxy statement the cngc through its regular review and approval of the performance measures applicable to performance based compensation already analyzes whether our incentive compensation programs appropriately incentivize our senior executives to achieve our strategic priorities including the strategic priority of returns the cngc via the cdas included in the companys annual proxy statements already reports to shareholders on an annual basis regarding the relationship between our incentive compensation programs and the companys roi performance and how the companys roi performance may have a meaningful impact on the amount of compensation our neos receive commensurate with its responsibilities the cngc will continue to analyze whether the performance measures used in our incentive compensation programs properly incentivize our senior executives to achieve the companys strategic priorities in light of the companys evolving business strategy and consistent with the rules and regulations of the sec the cngcs analyses of our incentive compensation programs will continue to be reported to shareholders in our annual proxy statements furthermore because the board has approved an annual shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our neos we believe that our shareholders have an adequate opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of the companys incentive compensation plans and programs each year because the cngc already regularly analyzes whether our incentive compensation programs provide proper incentives to our neos to achieve our companys strategic priorities including roi and because our shareholders already receive annual reports on those matters in the cdas in our annual proxy statements we believe that the adoption of the policy requested by the proposal is unnecessary duplicative of practices already followed by the cngc and our company and would result in an expenditure of walmarts resources and our managements and directors time that ultimately would not be in our shareholders best interests for the above reasons
