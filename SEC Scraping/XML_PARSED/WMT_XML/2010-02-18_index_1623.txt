the three months ended january the fy quarter and the fiscal year ended january fy and our financial condition as of january the press release provides information regarding certain financial measures that may be considered non gaap financial measures each a non gaap measure under the rules of the securities and exchange commission certain of those non gaap measures include our return on investment roi for fy and for the fiscal year ended january fy we believe the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles each a gaap measure most directly comparable to our roi for those periods is our return on assets calculated as described in the press release roa for fy and fy which were and respectively a reconciliation of our roi for fy to our roa for fy is included as exhibit hereto financial measures presented on a constant currency basis which are calculated by translating the results of our international operating segment international for a fiscal period in the local currencies in which international operates into u s dollars using the currency exchange rates used to translate the similar results of international for the prior year comparable period into u s dollars to report those prior period results in our consolidated financial statements our total u s comparable store sales and our sams club operating segments comparable club sales for the thirteen week periods and fifty two week periods ended january and january calculated excluding the fuel sales of sams club for such periods our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart for fy and our adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to walmart for fy and for the three months ended january the fy quarter as to which the most directly comparable gaap measures are our diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart for fy which was per share and our income from continuing operations attributable to walmart for fy which was billion and the fy quarter which was billion the press release provides information that reconciles each of these non gaap measures other than fy roi to the most directly comparable gaap measures the press release discusses the reasons why our management believes the presentation of our roi and such adjusted earnings per share and adjusted earnings provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations our management believes that presentation of the other non gaap measures discussed above provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations as to the periods for which they are presented for the following reasons we are required to translate our international segments operating results as stated in local currencies into u s dollars to report our results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles period over period comparisons of our operating results can be affected by the differences between currency exchange rates in the prior fiscal period to which the comparison is made and the currency exchange rates in the current fiscal period as reflected in our operating results reported in u s dollars making an investors assessment of the underlying performance of international and its effect on total company underlying performance for the current fiscal period more difficult the presentation of the non gaap measures described above as stated on a constant currency basis permits investors to understand important aspects of internationals underlying performance in the current fiscal period without the effect of any period to period fluctuations in applicable currency exchange rates and how that performance would have affected our results of operations in the current fiscal period and in period over period comparisons had currency exchange rates remained constant since the comparable prior year period our total u s comparable store sales and comparable club sales excluding the fuel sales at our sams club operating segment permit investors to understand the effect of

million charge million net of tax or per share from several business restructurings that occurred in the three months ended january as to fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal the company defines

supplemental and in addition to and not as a substitute for the information relating to the companys income from continuing operations and diluted income per share from continuing operations included in the press release these non gaap financial measures provide investors with an understanding of our income from continuing operations and diluted income per share from continuing operations adjusted for the items described above and assist investors in making a ready comparison of the companys diluted income per share from continuing operations for its fiscal years ended january and january and the fiscal quarters ended january and january as so adjusted against those published securities analysts estimates of the companys diluted earnings i e income per share from continuing operations for those periods that did not include the effect of such adjustments and against published average or consensus estimates of the companys diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for those periods that are based at least in part on such analysts estimates the following table reconciles income from continuing operations and diluted income per share from continuing operations for the

operations or adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in this reconciliation refer to income from continuing operations attributable to walmart diluted income per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart adjusted earnings from continuing operations attributable to walmart or adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated positive free cash flow of billion and billion for the years ended january and respectively the increase in our free cash flow is primarily the result of improved operating results and inventory management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the years ended january and as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities in those periods for the years endedjanuary amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities calculation of return on investment and return on assets management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percent for the fiscal year ended january we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows fortheyearendedjanuary dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income
