information at the end of this release regarding non gaap financial measures wal mart stores inc reconciliations of and other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billionand billionfor the nine months endedoctober and respectively the increase in free cash flow was led by improved working capital management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months endedoctober dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar non usd entities into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions of non usd entities if any until such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions of non usd entities the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three and nine months endedoctober three months ended october nine

for the week and week periods ended october and october and for the week period ending jan in each case calculated by excluding sam s club s fuel sales for such periods the sam s club comparable sales measures are non gaap financial measures as defined by the sec s rules we believe the sam s club comparable club sales for the historical periods for which the corresponding sam s club comparable sales measures are presented calculated by including fuel sales are the financial measures computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to the respective sam s club comparable sales measures we believe that the presentation of the sam s club comparable sales measures provides useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of the fuel sales which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on sam s club s comparable club sales for the periods presented adjusted epsforecasted adjusted eps forecasted adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes that forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for fiscal performance to the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmart s core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal by adjusting forecasted eps for the amount of the impact of the gain from the sale of yihaodian in china forecasted adjusted eps fiscal fiscal diluted net income per share forecasted adjusted eps adjustments q gain on the sale of yihaodian in china q tax

non gaap measures roi we include return on assets roa which is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u s gaap as well as return on investment roi as metrics to assess returns on assets management believes roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roa was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively roi was percent and percent for the trailing twelve months ended october and respectively the declines in roa and roi were primarily due to our decrease in operating income we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases as mentioned above we consider return on assets to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustments mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than roa although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi non gaap measures roi cont the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assets trailing twelve months ended trailing twelve months ended

denominator depreciation and amortization average total assets rent return on assets roa adjusted operating income denominator certain balance sheet data average total assets total assets average

capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by non gaap measures free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billion and billion for the nine months ended october and respectively the increase in free cash flow was led by improved working capital management free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmarts definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities nine months ended october dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment capital expenditures free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow change versus prior year comparable period excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations related to acquisitions until the acquisitions are

operating income the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar non usd entities into u s dollars we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions of non usd entities if any until such acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmarts underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions of non usd entities the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues net sales and operating income for the three and nine months ended october non gaap measures fuel impact the net sales and operating income of sams club for the quarter ended october the percentage changes in those financial measures from the prior year period sams clubs comparable club sales for the week and week periods ended october and sams clubs projected comparable club sales for the week period ending january in each case calculated by excluding sams clubs fuel sales for such periods are non gaap financial measures we believe the sams club net sales and operating income for the quarter ended october the percentage changes in those financial measures from the prior year period sams clubs comparable club sales for the week and week periods ended october and sams clubs projected comparable club sales for the week period ending january in each case calculated by including sams clubs fuel sales for such period are respectively the financial measures computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to the non gaap financial measures described above we believe that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures with respect to sams club described above provides useful information to investors regarding walmarts financial condition and results of operations because that information permits investors to understand the effect of the fuel sales of sams club which are affected by the volatility of fuel prices on sams clubs net sales and operating income and on sams clubs comparable club sales for the periods presented non gaap measures fuel impact cont the table below reflects

adjusted eps forecasted adjusted eps forecasted adjusted eps is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes that forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for certain items recorded in the period is the metric that best allows comparison of the expected performance for fiscal to the performance for the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management is forecasting for walmarts core earnings performance for fiscal and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of the core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated forecasted adjusted eps for fiscal by adjusting forecasted eps for the amount of the impact of the gain from the sale of yihaodian in china forecasted adjusted eps fiscal fiscal diluted net income per share forecasted adjusted eps adjustments q gain on the sale of yihaodian in china q tax
