information at the end of this release regarding non gaap financial measures during the week period the walmart u s comp was driven by an increase in average ticket of percent and a traffic decline of basis points according to the nielsen company we gained basis points of market share in the measured category of food consumables and health wellness otc during the weeks ended jan and according to the npd group for the three month period ending dec we also improved market share in toys and the walmart entertainment categories despite comps at the low end of the guidance our market share gains as noted by nielsen and npd along with our two year positive comp trend indicates the underlying strength of walmart s business said simon comp sales grew by percent for the quarter lapping a solid percent comp last year this represented million in comp growth for the quarter the walmart u s week comp for last year s first quarter week period rose percent we are confident that our low prices will continue to resonate as families adjust to a reduced paycheck and increased gas prices simon said we see the underlying health of the walmart u s business is sound and sales trends are similar to what we ve demonstrated in the last few quarters however february sales started slower than planned due in large part to the delay in income tax refunds we began seeing increased tax refund check activity late last week in our stores resulting in a more normalized weekly sales pattern for this time of the year due to the slower sales rate in the first few weeks of this year s first quarter we are forecasting comp sales for the week period from jan to apr to be around flat we continue to monitor economic conditions that can impact our sales such as rising fuel prices changes in inflation and the payroll tax increase the sam s club week comp excluding fuel benefited from a percent increase in traffic and a percent increase in average ticket overall we are proud of the accomplishments this year at sam s club but also recognize the mounting economic concern from both small businesses and consumers said rosalind brewer sam s club president and chief executive officer the business member at sam s club is an integral part of our comp sales recent traffic patterns of our business members indicate that they are more deliberate in their spending due to macro economic factors additionally like walmart u s our advantage members are pressured by higher payroll income taxes ongoing unemployment and higher gas prices our role at sam s club is to support our members by creating value for them through price investments last year sam s club comp without fuel for the first quarter comparable week period rose percent our primary growth for fiscal will come from comp sales brewer said similar to walmart u s the first two weeks of our first quarter comp period were below plan but have improved over the last week we expect comp club sales without fuel for the current week period

other information regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited in millions except per share data the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billionand billionfor the fiscal years ended jan and respectively the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to income from continuing operations outpacing the growth in capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other company the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow for the fiscal years ended jan and as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities in those periods fiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow calculation of return on investment and return on assetsmanagement believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with any possible short term impacts roi was percentand percentfor the fiscal years ended jan and respectively the decline was primarily driven by acquisitions and currency exchange rate fluctuations we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate its roi before comparing our roi to that of such other company the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measurement is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assetsfiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest income depreciation and

return on assets roa as of january certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by total assets of continuing operations as of jan and in the

consolidated balance sheet constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates are those we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects
