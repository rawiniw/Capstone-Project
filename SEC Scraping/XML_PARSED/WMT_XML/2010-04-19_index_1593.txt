compensation discussion and analysis executive summary overview in the following pages we discuss how our ceo cfo and certain other current executive officers our named executive officers or neos were compensated in fiscal and describe how this compensation fits within our executive compensation philosophy during fiscal under the leadership of our senior executive team our company performed well we reported strong financial results for the fiscal year particularly our earnings results despite continued challenging economic conditions worldwide our earnings for fiscal significantly exceeded the top end of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year our free cash flow increased significantly over fiscal and we finished the fiscal year with a strong balance sheet our company continued to deliver stable pre tax returns with return on investment for fiscal the same as return on investment for fiscal our stock price increased slightly during fiscal and we returned more than billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends walmart us continued to grow profits faster than sales and continued to manage inventory effectively with inventory down percent versus the prior year and walmart us continues to be well positioned in the current economic environment comparable store sales at walmart us were slightly down in fiscal walmart international continued its strong growth with sales increasing above expectations sams club also experienced continued growth with comparable club sales excluding fuel increasing with fuel comparable club sales decreased slightly sams club also reduced inventory by percent these accomplishments resulted in the compensation described below for fiscal with our cash incentive plan which is based on profitability paying out at or near maximum levels our performance share plan which is based on return on investment and sales metrics resulted in payouts to our neos that were between threshold and target the total compensation earned by our neos in fiscal was reflective of our overall strong performance our compensation program emphasizes performance we design our neo compensation with an emphasis on performance base salary typically comprises less than percent of each neos total annual compensation opportunity and a substantial majority of each neos annual compensation is contingent on meeting performance goals that we believe have a meaningful impact on shareholder value the cngc regularly reviews our executive compensation programs to ensure that compensation is closely tied to performance that can be influenced by our executives and that we believe is likely to impact shareholder value our neos annual cash incentive is based on the profitability of our company and or one or more operating divisions depending on each neos responsibilities our performance share program is based on total company return on investment as well as the sales performance of one or more operating divisions depending on each neos area of responsibility we believe that this balance of performance metrics and balance between rewarding the performance of the total company and the performance of operating divisions mitigates the risk that our executives would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single metric or operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole in addition our executive compensation program seeks to balance rewarding long term performance with shorter term performance our cash incentive plan is based on single fiscal year results while our performance share plan is based on financial performance over a three year period our executives also receive service based restricted stock which typically vests in equal installments on the second fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date our company and each of our operating divisions had strong earnings performance for fiscal because our cash incentive plan is based on pre tax profit and operating income our executives received cash incentive payouts for fiscal that were at or near the maximum potential payout conversely our comparable store and club sales results for fiscal were not as strong as we expected when performance goals were set in early fiscal because our performance share program is based in part on performance versus sales metrics results under our performance share program were below the target performance goals for that program the cash incentives and performance shares earned by our neos for fiscal are discussed in more detail below because it is our goal to provide our executives with performance based compensation on criteria they can impact we consider underlying operational performance adjusted to ensure that operating results for the fiscal year are comparable to the prior year during fiscal the most significant adjustments were to remove the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and certain restructuring charges announced in the fourth quarter the adjustments made for purposes of determining fiscal performance under our compensation programs are described in more detail below table of contents executive compensation overview who are our neos for fiscal our neos were michael t duke our president and ceo mr duke joined our company in and has served in a number of positions including vice chairman prior to becoming president and ceo in february thomas m schoewe our executive vice president and cfo mr schoewe joined our company in eduardo castro wright our vice chairman mr castro wright joined our company in c douglas mcmillon our executive vice president president and ceo of walmart international mr mcmillon joined our company in brian c cornell our executive vice president president and ceo of sams club mr cornell joined our company in what are the primary components of our executive compensation program the annual compensation of our neos consists of three main components base salary a performance based annual cash incentive payment and annual equity based compensation comprised of a long term performance based award and a long term service based award for purposes of setting neo compensation the cngc considers the amount that each neo could earn from these three components assuming performance goals are achieved and all service based equity awards vest as that neos total direct compensation or tdc we discuss each of these components of tdc in greater detail below in addition our neos may from time to time receive special equity awards special awards are typically granted for retention purposes or in recognition of extraordinary performance fiscal compensation what were the significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal there were no significant changes to our compensation program for neos in fiscal prior to setting neo compensation for fiscal the cngc undertook a comprehensive review and analysis of our executive compensation program to determine if any improvements could be made to tie executive compensation more closely to performance and to otherwise align our executive compensation program more closely with shareholder interests for fiscal we further refined the performance metrics for our performance share program by distinguishing between walmart us comparable store sales and or sams club comparable club sales depending on the executives primary area of responsibility what was the tdc for each of our neos during fiscal and fiscal when setting neo compensation the cngc establishes a tdc amount for each neo and then allocates that tdc among the various components of compensation tdc represents the compensation opportunity available to an neo for a given fiscal year if performance goals are achieved as shown in the table below target tdc represents the amounts our neos would receive if target performance goals are achieved maximum tdc represents the amounts that our neos would receive if maximum performance goals are achieved and is therefore intended to reflect the amounts our neos would receive only in the event of exceptional performance the summary compensation table that appears on page provides specific compensation information for the three most recent fiscal years for our neos in the manner required by sec rules the amounts in the summary compensation table do not necessarily reflect the compensation opportunities approved by the cngc for our neos nor do they necessarily provide insight into the compensation actually earned by each neo upon satisfaction of applicable performance conditions for example our cngc typically approves neo compensation for the upcoming fiscal year in january prior to the start of our fiscal year on february as a result the equity awards that appear in the summary compensation table as granted in a particular fiscal year are typically part of an neos compensation package for the following fiscal year table of contents the following table shows the tdc established for each neo for fiscal and fiscal inclusion of this information is not designed to replace the summary compensation table but rather to provide insight into the cngcs decision making process when establishing neo compensation tdc for purposes of the table below is defined as the sum of base salary potential annual performance based cash incentive payout and estimated grant date value of annual equity awards assuming performance goals are satisfied because tdc is established through a benchmarking process as described below tdc does not include any one time or special awards as these types of awards are generally not reflected in the benchmarking data that is available for our peer group companies fiscal tdc fiscal tdc name target maximum target maximum michael t duke thomas m schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell n a n a mr duke was promoted from vice chairman to president and ceo effective february effective november mr castro wright was promoted from executive vice president president and ceo walmart us to vice chairman effective february mr mcmillon was promoted from executive vice president president and ceo sams club to executive vice president president and ceo walmart international the increases in tdc for fiscal shown above for messrs duke castro wright and mcmillon are reflective of these promotions mr schoewes increase in tdc is primarily attributable to an increase in the value of his annual equity award the cngc determined that mr schoewes performance in fiscal was strong as demonstrated by our companys excellent financial management and strong balance sheet the cngc also determined that mr schoewes annual equity value and as a result his tdc was relatively low given his performance and level of experience the cngcs annual benchmarking process is described in detail below mr cornell was appointed as executive vice president president and ceo sams club effective april the tdc amounts above for mr cornell are shown on an annualized basis a significant percentage of the tdc amounts shown above consisted of performance based cash and equity for example for fiscal approximately percent of our ceos target tdc consisted of performance shares and an additional percent of his target tdc consisted of his cash incentive opportunity the differences in tdc among our neos are due to factors that the cngc considers in evaluating and establishing the compensation of our neos these factors include the differences in job scope and responsibilities among our neos the cngcs review of peer group compensation information through peer benchmarking which is described in more detail below expertise and years of experience historical compensation levels retention and succession considerations and individual and where relevant divisional performance the tdc levels set forth in the table above represent the cngcs judgment as to the appropriate compensation opportunities in light of these factors and are not the result of any specific policy or formula table of contents how is the tdc of our neos allocated among the various elements of compensation each neos tdc is comprised of the following elements base salary annual cash incentive opportunity and equity each neos equity award is comprised of performance shares and restricted stock for fiscal the cngc allocated a majority of each neos target tdc to performance based elements of compensation as follows breakdown of fiscal target tdc name basesalary restricted stock grantdatevalue performance based compensation all performance based compensation performanceshares plus cash incentiveat target performanceshares at target cashincentive at target michael t duke thomasm schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell percentages in this table reflect the percentage of target tdc represented by the particular element of compensation these percentages have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent and may not total percent due to rounding base salary in keeping with our philosophy that a substantial majority of neo compensation should be performance based the cngc typically allocates less than percent of tdc to base salary because our more senior executives typically have a large portion of their annual compensation at risk the percentage of tdc attributable to base salary generally becomes smaller as our executives advance in our company and assume jobs with greater responsibilities for fiscal and fiscal our neos base salaries were as follows name fiscal basesalary fiscal basesalary michael t duke thomas m schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell n a in establishing the base salaries of our neos the cngc also benchmarks the proposed base salaries for our neos against base salaries within our peer groups to ensure that our neos base salaries are appropriately competitive the cngc typically seeks to set base salaries near the th percentile of our peer groups the cngc will set base salaries higher or lower if necessary to result in tdcs in the top quartile of our peer groups or if necessary to result in an appropriate mix of performance based versus fixed compensation the benchmarking process is described in more detail below the base salary increases shown above for messrs duke and mcmillon are a result of their promotions and are reflective of their new positions mr schoewe received a percent increase in base salary which is in line with base salary increases for management associates generally who are deemed to be performing at a high level mr cornells base salary is shown on an annualized basis cash incentive under our management incentive plan most salaried management associates including our neos are eligible to earn an annual cash incentive payment calculated as a percentage of base salary whether an incentive payment is earned and the amount of the incentive payment depend on whether we achieve pre established performance goals for fiscal as for the past several fiscal years these goals were based on growth in pre tax profit for the total company and on growth in operating income for each of the companys divisions incentive payments are also based on achieving diversity goals table of contents in addition beginning in fiscal we added an individual performance component to the management incentive plan under the plan as revised the cngc may in its discretion increase or decrease the amount of any individual neos cash incentive payment by up to percent of the target payout for that neo based upon the cngcs subjective evaluation of that neos individual performance for fiscal and fiscal our neos had the opportunity to earn the following cash incentives expressed as a percentage of base salary cashincentiveopportunityasa ofbasesalary name fiscalyear threshold target maximum michael t duke thomas m schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell n a n a n a the increases in cash incentive opportunity for mr duke and mr mcmillon are due to their promotions the actual cash incentives earned by our neos for fiscal performance are described on page below equity awards the balance of tdc is then allocated between various forms of equity compensation we believe that equity awards that vest over a period of time help to align the interests of our neos with the interests of our shareholders consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to performance for fiscal as in fiscal approximately three quarters of the annual equity value granted to our neos was granted in the form of performance shares with the remainder granted in the form of restricted stock performance shares a performance share award gives the officer receiving it the right to receive a number of shares if we meet certain performance goals during a specified performance period if an associate who holds performance shares ceases to be employed by us before the end of the applicable performance period the performance shares do not vest and the recipient receives no payout for those performance shares generally performance shares granted to our executives have a three year performance period for performance share awards granted prior to january the applicable performance metrics were return on investment and revenue growth beginning in fiscal we replaced the revenue growth metric used in prior performance share grants with a comparable store and club sales improvement metric and or a growth in international revenue metric depending on the neos area of responsibility these metrics are discussed in more detail below restricted stock the remaining percent of the equity value granted to each neo was in the form of restricted stock which is scheduled to vest in three equal installments on the second fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date so long as the neo remains employed by our company on the vesting dates the estimated value of the equity awards granted to our neos for fiscal and fiscal assuming target performance under the performance share metrics is as follows name fiscal equityvalue fiscal equityvalue michael t duke thomas m schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell n a because the cngc approved these equity awards prior to the beginning of the fiscal year these awards are included in the summary compensation table as compensation for the prior fiscal year the increases in mr dukes mr castro wrights and mr mcmillons equity values for fiscal were primarily a result of their promotions to their current positions and our benchmarking process described below the increase in mr schoewes annual equity value is primarily due to the cngcs determination through its benchmarking process that mr schoewes equity value was relatively low given his performance and level of experience table of contents do our neos receive any compensation that is not included in tdc on occasion we grant our officers including our neos special equity awards that are not included in tdc these awards are generally in the form of restricted stock and are intended for retention purposes and or to reward exceptional performance in november in connection with their promotions to their present positions the cngc approved in performance based restricted stock awards to both mr duke and mr castro wright the vesting of these awards was contingent on our company achieving at least percent revenue growth in fiscal in march the cngc certified that this performance condition had been satisfied these awards continue to be subject to service based vesting requirements with mr dukes award scheduled to vest on january and mr castro wrights award scheduled to vest on june reflective of their new positions the cngc in late fiscal also approved increases in mr dukes and mr castro wrights performance shares with performance periods ending january and january respectively these equity awards are reported in the summary compensation table on page as part of fiscal compensation as a result the amounts reported for mr duke and mr castro wright in the stock awards column of the summary compensation table are greater for fiscal than for fiscal in january as part of the fiscal executive compensation process our cngc approved a performance based restricted stock award to mr castro wright with the award scheduled to vest in june the cngc also approved a service based restricted stock award to mr mcmillon with the award scheduled to vest in equal installments on the second fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date as a condition to receiving these awards mr castro wright and mr mcmillon were required to execute non competition agreements with walmart the terms of which are described on page as part of his offer of employment mr cornell is entitled to a signing bonus of with one half paid in march and the other half to be paid in march during the first two years of mr cornells employment walmart is entitled to recover this signing bonus if mr cornell voluntarily resigns from walmart or is terminated for a violation of walmart policy furthermore no signing bonus installment shall be paid if prior to the scheduled date of payment mr cornell voluntarily resigns from walmart mr cornell is terminated as the result of mr cornells violation of walmart policy or mr cornells employment is terminated as the result of his death or disability additionally mr cornell received a grant of restricted stock valued at in connection with commencing his employment with walmart in april this restricted stock grant is scheduled to vest in equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date finally mr cornell received certain relocation benefits in fiscal including reimbursement of certain losses on the sale of his home a relocation allowance duplicate housing costs and tax gross up payments related to such relocation benefits in addition our neos receive other benefits generally available to our associates such as participation in our profit sharing k plan our stock purchase plan and other plans available to our officers such as our deferred compensation plan our neos also receive certain perquisites and supplemental benefits described below table of contents what financial performance metrics were applied to our neos compensation awarded for fiscal the cngc selected the following performance metrics to apply to our neos incentive based compensation during fiscal element of compensation fiscal performance metrics performanceperiod cash incentive pre taxprofit fortotal company operating income for divisions performance shares return on investment walmart us comparable store sales sams club comparable club sales international revenue growth the cngc chose these performance metrics because it believed that good performance relative to these metrics is important for our overall financial performance and therefore is likely to have a positive effect on shareholder returns the cngc concluded that the combination of these performance metrics was likely to incentivize our executives to achieve performance that is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders the cngc believes that the combination of these performance metrics helps to mitigate the risk that our executives would be incentivized to pursue good results with respect to a single metric to the detriment of our company as a whole for example if our management were to seek to increase comparable store or club sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in cash incentive payouts what were the specific performance goals for fiscal and how did our company perform relative to those goals cash incentive payment goals the cngc generally attempts to set performance goals applicable to our cash incentive plan so that a consistent level of expected difficulty in achieving these goals is maintained from year to year the goals applicable to the cash incentive payments are expressed in terms of a percentage increase over our prior year performance as described below the cash incentive payments of our neos that are responsible for one of our operating divisions are based in part on the performance of those operating divisions for fiscal the threshold target and maximum performance goals under our cash incentive plan and our actual performance are shown in the following table because operating performance for purposes of the cash incentive plan is calculated on an as adjusted basis the actual results shown in the table below differ from our reported operating results fiscal pre taxprofitandoperatingincomegoalsunder cash incentive plan increase over fiscal goal applicable to threshold target maximum actual asadjusted total company pre tax profit walmart us operating income international operating income sams club operating income for the purpose of our cash incentive plan we define pre tax profit as income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest subject to certain adjustments necessary to compare pre tax profit results for a particular fiscal year to the prior years results on a comparable basis we have described the adjustments for fiscal below such pre tax profit as adjusted may be considered a non gaap financial measure under the secs rules for purposes of the performance shares we define return on investment which is a non gaap measure as defined in the secs rules as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income and depreciation and amortization and rent from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average investment during that period we consider average investment to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight the definition of comparable store sales and comparable club sales for this purpose is the same as the definition used for financial reporting purposes and includes sales from stores and clubs in the united states open for the previous months including remodels relocations and expansions changes in format are excluded from comparable store sales when the conversion is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in square footage of more than five percent comparable club sales as calculated for this purpose exclude the fuel sales of our sams club operations table of contents these goals were established in light of the operating plans for our company and each of its divisions and in light of economic conditions in our industry and in the broader markets in which we operated at the time the goals were established in february in order to achieve the target goals set forth above our company and operating divisions would have to perform in line with our earnings expectations and operating plan at the time the goals were set in order to achieve the maximum goals the performance of our company and operating divisions would have to exceed those expectations by a significant amount the higher performance goals for our international division relative to our other divisions reflected our strategic growth plans for our international operations including market conditions and the level of capital investment required for growth in the international markets in which we operate the sams club goals reflected the impact of fuel prices which contributed significantly to income in fiscal but were expected to have a negative impact on income in fiscal in determining actual performance for purposes of our cash incentive plan the cngc made certain positive and negative adjustments to the pre tax profit results of our total company and operating income results for each of our operating divisions as provided by the terms of the plan these adjustments are intended to enable results for a particular fiscal year to be computed on a comparable basis to the prior year and to ensure that our cash incentive plan rewards underlying operational performance disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives for fiscal the most significant adjustments to pre tax profit and operating income were to remove the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to exclude charges related to restructurings announced in the fourth quarter other adjustments were to exclude the impact of interest expense related to share repurchases to exclude the operating income related to recent acquisitions and to exclude accruals for litigation settlements as a result of this adjustment process the fiscal increases in operating income shown in the table above differ from our publicly reported operating results for fiscal under gaap after these adjustments the fiscal performance results under our cash incentive plan

additional award for mr mcmillon the cngc considered the outstanding performance of walmart international in a challenging environment and mr mcmillons contributions to that performance including his efforts in developing and executing a comprehensive global strategy walmart internationals net sales exceeded billion for the first time in fiscal and walmart international remains our fastest growing segment walmart international sales would have been even higher without the impact of lower currency exchange rates against the u s dollar walmart international also grew its operating income faster than sales during fiscal table of contents a portion of each neos cash incentive payment is also subject to meeting diversity goals for fiscal these goals consisted of two components placement goals and good faith efforts goals under our diversity goals program each officers cash incentive payment can be reduced by up to percent if he or she does not achieve applicable diversity goals for the fiscal year based on the report of our chief diversity officer the cngc determined that each neo satisfied his diversity goals for fiscal performance shares performance shares represent the long term performance based component of our executive compensation program performance shares vest only if performance goals over a three year period are satisfied the following table shows the performance

performance metrics in an effort to align the performance share program more closely with performance metrics that can be influenced by our executives for performance shares with a three year performance period ending january and january the weighting of these metrics for our neos for fiscal is as follows name return oninvestment walmart uscomparablestoresales sams clubcomparableclub sales internationalrevenue growth michael t duke thomas m schoewe eduardo castro wright c douglas mcmillon brian c cornell performance shares granted to officers with primary responsibility for the total company such as mr duke and mr schoewe are subject to a mix of the four performance measures described above performance shares granted to officers with primary responsibility for one of our operating divisions such as messrs castro wright mcmillon and cornell are subject to the performance measure corresponding to their operating division along with total company return on investment this approach is consistent with our philosophy of compensating officers based on performance within their influence while still tying a significant portion of executive compensation to the performance of the overall company as a result of its review of the performance share awards and how well they served their intended purpose beginning in fiscal the cngc also changed the manner in which performance goals are set and measured for awards granted prior to january performance goals were set at the beginning of the three year vesting period for the entire three year period after several years of experience with performance shares we determined that as a practical matter setting goals at the beginning of a three year period for the entire period could result in performance goals that were either not realistically achievable or that could prove to be too easy to achieve in either instance performance shares would cease to be an effective tool in motivating performance the performance shares granted in january and in subsequent years continue to have a three year vesting period and continue to be based on performance over that three year period however the cngc now sets the goals for each fiscal year within the three year performance cycle at the beginning of that fiscal year at the end of the full three year performance cycle we will calculate the average of our actual performance for each year in the three year performance period against that years performance goals to determine whether any performance shares will vest and if so how many we believe that this change gives the cngc the ability to set more effective performance goals based on more current information and over a more realistic time frame table of contents the following table shows the performance

as noted above the performance considered for purposes of our executive compensation program is adjusted to ensure that operating results for a particular fiscal year are computed on a comparable basis to the prior year and are intended to measure underlying operating performance therefore the results shown above differ from our reported operating results for fiscal for example the international revenue growth shown above is on a constant dollar basis excluding the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates these results will be averaged with the results against performance goals established by the cngc for the other two fiscal years within the three year performance period to determine the ultimate payout for these performance shares what perquisites and other benefits do our neos receive our neos receive a limited number of perquisites and supplemental benefits we cover the cost of annual physical examinations we provide each neo with personal use of our aircraft for a specified number of hours each year certain neos receive monitoring and maintenance of home security systems our neos also receive company paid life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance our neos also are entitled to benefits available to associates generally including a walmart discount card a limited percent match of purchases of our common stock through our stock purchase plan medical benefits and foreign business travel insurance we provide these perquisites and supplemental benefits to attract talented executives to our company and to retain our current executives what types of retirement benefits are our neos eligible for our neos are eligible for the same retirement benefits as our officers generally such as participation in our deferred compensation plan they may also take advantage of other benefits available more broadly to our associates such as our profit sharing k plan and our serp which is a non qualified non defined benefit plan in which all of our associates participate to the extent the internal revenue code limits the amounts we would ordinarily contribute for their benefit under our profit sharing k plan process for establishing neo compensation what is the cngcs role in determining neo compensation under its charter the cngc is responsible for establishing and approving annually the compensation of our ceo and in consultation with the ceo our other executive officers including our other neos more information regarding the members of the cngc and the cngcs responsibilities is set forth under board committees on page the cngc meets numerous times each year as part of the process of establishing neo compensation the cngc met a total of nine times in fiscal and met another nine times in fiscal during each of these meetings the cngc considered executive compensation matters including the review and approval of compensation for our neos the selection of performance metrics and performance goals applicable to neo compensation and the review of performance against those metrics given the importance of executive compensation decisions we engage in an extensive agenda planning and review process each regularly scheduled cngc meeting agenda is reviewed in advance by our corporate secretary the executive vice president of our people division our ceo our chairman and the chair of the cngc to ensure that the appropriate matters are considered at each meeting that appropriate time is allocated to each agenda item and that cngc members have appropriate input into and information regarding each agenda item table of contents what is the role of management and compensation consultants with respect to neo compensation when evaluating establishing and approving the compensation of our neos other than the ceo the cngc considers the performance evaluations provided by our ceo and the recommendations provided by our chairman our people division and our ceo as part of this process our ceo reviews his annual performance evaluations of the other neos with the cngc our chairman with support from our people division reviews our ceos evaluation with the cngc and makes recommendations to the cngc regarding our ceos compensation our people division engages hay group inc hay group a compensation consulting firm on a limited basis to assist it in formulating its recommendations to the cngc regarding neo compensation in analyzing the appropriate level of compensation for our neos for fiscal our people division relied on benchmarking data and a benchmarking system developed by hay group regarding executive pay at peer companies as described below hay group generally only advises management on compensation matters but in the past has been and in the future may be engaged to assist our company with non compensation related services representatives of hay group are available to meet with the cngc independently at the cngcs request beginning in early through fiscal watson wyattworldwide inc watson wyatt served as the cngcs independent consultant on executive compensation matters and assisted in assessing and establishing the compensation of our executive officers including our neos during the term of its engagement by the cngc watson wyatt reported directly and exclusively to the cngc and the cngc had sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of watson wyatt during fiscal representatives of watson wyatt attended all cngc meetings at which neo compensation was an agenda item and consulted frequently with members of the cngc independently of management watson wyatt also made recommendations to the cngc regarding the compensation of our ceo watson wyatt assisted the cngc in evaluating the appropriateness of the compensation to be provided to our neos for fiscal and fiscal in this role representatives of watson wyatt attended portions of cngc meetings during which executive compensation matters were considered and met with and advised members of the cngc on executive compensation matters including the proposed compensation of our neos outside of cngc meetings effective january watson wyatt merged with towers perrin forster crosby inc towers perrin to form towers watson co towers watson walmart management has historically engaged towers perrin to perform a variety of human resources and benefits consulting services and continues to engage towers watson to perform these services in light of the pending merger beginning in the fall of the cngc began to explore various alternatives to ensure that the advice it receives from its executive compensation consultant continues to be independent and objective on february the cngc unanimously voted to terminate its engagement of watson wyatt and to engage ira t kay company llc ira t kay company as its independent executive compensation consultant going forward ira kay served as watson wyatts primary advisor to the cngc during the term of watson wyatts engagement by the cngc on january mr kay left watson wyatt and founded ira t kay company under the terms of its engagement of ira t kay company ira t kay company will report directly and exclusively to the cngc the cngc will have sole authority to retain terminate and approve the fees of ira t kay company and ira t kay company may not be engaged to provide any additional consulting services to walmart without the approval of the cngc how does the cngc set tdc the process of setting tdc is a dynamic one in setting tdc for fiscal the cngc considered among other things the peer group data and analyses described below our overall performance in fiscal in the context of a challenging economic environment including our financial and operating performance and for those neos having direct responsibility for the performance of one of our operating divisions the performance of that operating division each neos individual performance and contributions to our achievement of financial goals and operational milestones each neos job responsibilities expertise historical compensation and years and level of experience and the importance of retaining each neo and each neos potential to assume greater responsibilities in the future we do not have any predetermined formula that determines which of these factors is more or less important in setting tdc and the importance of specific factors may vary from neo to neo the cngc considers the individual circumstances of each neo and the needs of our company when determining the importance of these factors in setting tdc for each neo table of contents in evaluating individual performance the cngc relied on annual performance evaluations and for each neo other than the ceo on discussions with our ceo regarding such neos performance during the fiscal year in assessing our ceos performance the cngc also relied on an evaluation of our ceos performance conducted by our chairman and by the chair of the cngc and on discussions with our chairman regarding our ceos performance how is peer group data used by the cngc during the compensation setting process the cngc considers benchmarking data in several ways first benchmarking data was used to help determine the fiscal tdc amounts for each neo in benchmarking our neos against executives at peer group companies the cngc relied on comparative data and analyses provided to our people division by hay group to determine which positions at peer companies are most comparable to our neos through this process hay group analyzes positions at our company and at peer group companies and sizes each job using a consistent methodology to represent the relative scope and difficulty of these jobs this results in a point score for each job that is intended to provide for more accurate comparisons by referencing jobs of similar size our people division and the cngc relied on these comparisons to determine those positions at peer group companies that are most comparable in terms of job scope and responsibilities to the positions and job responsibilities of our neos using this data does not produce comparable positions at all of our peer group companies for all of our neos the cngc also used benchmarking data when allocating each neos tdc among the various elements of compensation as a general guide to ensure that the amount of tdc allocated to each element of compensation was set at an appropriately competitive level consistent with our emphasis on performance based compensation against what peer groups do we benchmark the compensation of our neos our company is the worlds largest retailer by a wide margin and has significantly more extensive international operations than most publicly traded u s based retailers as a result the cngc believes that simply benchmarking neo compensation against a retail industry index would not provide the cngc with sufficient information with which to determine the appropriate compensation of our neos therefore the cngc reviews publicly available information for three peer groups to determine how our neos compensation compares to the compensation paid to executives in comparable positions at other companies since information regarding positions comparable to those of some of our neos is not available for many of the companies in our peer groups using three peer groups also resulted in a larger number of comparable positions to which our neos compensation could be benchmarked data regarding each of these peer groups was compiled by our people division based on publicly available information as vice chairman mr castro wright has significant global responsibilities including global sourcing in addition to his responsibilities as head of our walmart us operations therefore we benchmark mr castro wrights compensation against that of ceos within our peer groups this results in mr castro wrights compensation benchmarking at a significantly lower percentile to his peers than our other neos retail industry survey this survey allows us to compare our neo compensation to that of our primary competitors in the retail industry for fiscal the retail industry survey included all publicly traded retail companies with significant u s operations with annual revenues exceeding approximately billion which were alimentation couche tard inc amazon com inc autonation inc best buy co inc circuit city

fiscal target tdc fell between the th and th percentiles of ceo tdcs within the retail industry survey table of contents select fortune we also benchmark our neo compensation against a select group of companies within the fortune this group which we refer to as the select fortune was chosen from among the fortune by the people division the select fortune includes companies whose primary business is not retailing but that are similar to us in one or more ways such as global operations business model and size we excluded retailers from this group since those companies were already represented in the retail industry survey we also excluded companies with business models that are broadly divergent from ours such as financial institutions and energy companies the companies included in the select fortune when setting fiscal compensation were com corporation altria group inc att inc caterpillar inc the coca cola company dell inc fedex corporation ford motor company general electric company

benchmarking for fiscal we were approximately times larger in terms of annual revenue and approximately times larger in terms of market capitalization than the retail industry survey at the median to take into account this size discrepancy and the corresponding complexity of our neos job responsibilities we also benchmark our neos pay against the largest public companies excluding walmart

within the top mr castro wrights fiscal target tdc was slightly above the th percentile of ceo tdcs within the top we did not attempt to quantify or otherwise assign any relative weightings to any of these peer groups or to any particular members of a peer group when benchmarking against them table of contents what other information does the cngc consider when establishing tdc the cngc also reviews other information in the process of setting tdc although the cngc generally considers these factors to be less significant than the factors described above realized compensation the cngc also reviews an estimate of the realized compensation of each of our neos during prior fiscal years as well as forecasts of the compensation that could be realized by our neos in future years the cngc reviews this information in order to understand the compensation actually earned by each neo and to determine whether such realized compensation is consistent with its view of the performance of each neo as well as to provide insight into retention considerations no specific quantitative criteria are used in performing this analysis rather the cngc views this information as helpful in making a subjective determination as to the appropriateness and reasonableness of each neos compensation and of the effectiveness of our compensation programs in achieving our objectives tally sheets the cngc also reviews tally sheets prepared by our companys people division these tally sheets summarize the total value of the compensation received by each neo for the fiscal year and quantify the value of each element of that compensation including perquisites and other benefits the tally sheets also quantify the amounts that would be owed to each neo upon retirement or separation from our company fiscal are there any significant changes to our executive compensation program for fiscal for fiscal the basic structure of our executive compensation program is unchanged tdc continues to be comprised of base salary cash incentive opportunity and equity awards equity awards continue to be divided between performance shares and service based restricted stock in february the cngc established fiscal performance metrics and goals for the cash incentive payable under the management incentive plan for fiscal the cash incentive payable to our neos under this plan will be based on operating income as well as diversity results as in prior years the cngc established threshold target and maximum performance goals under this plan the cngc set the performance goals for fiscal such that our neos should earn approximately their target cash incentive payment if our performance is in line with our earnings expectations as of february our company must achieve results near the top of the range of our earnings expectations in order to achieve maximum performance goals for fiscal in march the cngc established performance metrics and goals for fiscal for performance shares held by our neos for fiscal these goals will be based on return on investment and total sales growth for fiscal the cngc selected total sales growth as the sales metric for corporate support and for our walmart us and sams club divisions replacing comparable store sales which had been used in fiscal and fiscal this change is intended to align our performance share goals more closely with our evolving business strategy which emphasizes productive growth appropriate leverage and return on investment the cngc recognized that return on investment continues to be the highest weighted performance metric for the performance shares which should help ensure that our executives are incentivized to grow the business productively these performance goals were set at levels which if we perform in line with our expectations target goals should be achievable our company must perform at or near the top of our expectations with respect to each of these performance metrics in order to achieve maximum performance goals for fiscal general executive compensation matters what are our practices for granting stock options and other equity awards option exercise prices we did not grant any stock options to our neos during fiscal and stock options are not currently a part of our executive compensation program the cngc may grant stock options in the future in special circumstances when we grant stock options the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant timing of equity awards the cngc meets each january to approve and grant annual equity awards to our neos for the upcoming fiscal year because of the timing of these meetings equity grants awarded for an upcoming fiscal year are reported in the executive compensation tables appearing in this proxy statement as granted during the prior fiscal year the cngc meets again in february and or march to establish the performance goals applicable to the performance shares and any other performance based equity granted at the january meeting any special equity grants to executive officers during the year are approved by the cngc at a meeting or by unanimous written consent table of contents does the cngc take tax consequences into account when designing executive compensation yes section m of the internal revenue code provides that compensation in excess of paid to certain of our neos is generally not deductible unless it is performance based a significant portion of the compensation awarded to our neos satisfies the requirements for deductibility under section m when designing neo compensation the cngc considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes the cngc retains the ability to evaluate the performance of our neos and to pay appropriate compensation even if our company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws with the exception of the portion of the cash incentive payment attributable to individual performance made to mr mcmillon we believe that the cash incentive payments made to our neos for fiscal met these deductibility requirements we also believe that the performance shares with a performance period ending january held by our neos that vested met these deductibility requirements do we have employment agreements with our neos we do not have employment agreements with any of our neos all neos are employed on an at will basis do we have severance agreements with our neos we have entered into a post termination and non competition agreement with each neo each agreement provides that if we terminate the neos employment for any reason other than his violation of company policy we will generally pay the neo an amount equal to two times the neos base salary one fourth of which is paid upon termination of employment and the balance of which is paid in installments commencing six months after separation under these agreements each neo has agreed that for a two year period following his termination of employment he will not participate in a business that competes with us and will not solicit our associates for employment in this context competing business means any retail wholesale or merchandising business that sells products of the type sold by us is located in a country in which we have a store or in which the executive knows we expect to have a store within the near future and has annual retail revenues above certain thresholds these agreements reduce the risk that any of our former neos would use the skills and knowledge they gained while with us for the benefit of one of our competitors during a reasonable period after leaving our company for more information regarding payments that we may be required to make to our neos upon termination of employment see the disclosure below entitled potential payments upon termination or change in control does our compensation program contain any provisions addressing the recovery or nonpayment of compensation in the event of misconduct yes our cash incentive plan provides that in order to be eligible to receive an incentive payment the participant must have complied with our policies including our statement of ethics at all times it further provides that if the cngc determines within twelve months following the payment of an incentive award that prior to the payment of the award a participant has violated any of our policies or otherwise committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company the recipient must repay the incentive award upon demand similarly our stock incentive plan provides that if the cngc determines that an associate has committed any act detrimental to the best interests of our company he or she will forfeit all unexercised options and unvested shares of restricted stock and performance shares are our neos subject to any minimum requirements regarding ownership of our stock to further align the long term interests of our neos and our shareholders our board has approved the following stock ownership guidelines our ceo must maintain beneficial ownership of shares equal in market value to five times his current annual base salary and each of our other neos must beginning on the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment as an executive officer maintain beneficial ownership of shares equal in market value to three times his or her current annual base salary the board or cngc can modify these guidelines in the event of dramatic and unexpected changes in the market value of our shares or in other circumstances that the board or cngc deem appropriate all neos are currently in compliance with these guidelines table of contents are there any restrictions on the ability of neos to engage in speculative transactions involving company stock yes our insider trading policy allows neos to trade in our stock only during open window periods and only after they have pre cleared transactions moreover neos may not at any time engage in any short selling buy or sell exchange traded puts or calls or otherwise engage in any transaction in derivative securities that reflects speculation about the price of our stock or that may place their financial interests against the financial interests of our company risk considerations in our compensation program the cngc pursuant to its charter is responsible for reviewing and overseeing the compensation and benefits structure applicable to our associates generally we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices for our associates give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company in reaching this conclusion we considered the following factors our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation the variable cash incentive and performance share portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance under the cash incentive plan and longer term performance under the performance share plan we believe this design mitigates any incentive for short term risk taking that could be detrimental to our companys long term best interests our incentive compensation programs for officers reward a mix of different performance measures namely earnings based measures sales based measures and return on investment we believe that this mix of performance measures mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure for example if our management were to seek to increase sales by pursuing strategies that would negatively impact our profitability resulting increases in performance share payouts should be offset by decreases in annual cash incentive payouts maximum payouts under both our annual cash incentive plan and our performance share plan are capped at percent and percent of target payouts respectively we believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk taking since the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited a significant percentage of our managements incentive compensation is based on the performance of our total company this is designed to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating division to the detriment of our company as a whole our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines which we believe incentivize our executives to consider the long term interests of our company and our shareholders and discourage excessive risk taking that could negatively impact our stock price our incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout cliffs that might encourage short term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold finally our cash incentive plan and our stock incentive plan both contain provisions under which awards may be recouped or forfeited if the recipient has not complied with our policies including our statement of ethics or has committed acts detrimental to the best interests of our company table of contents

stock incentive plan which would amend restate and rename the stock incentive plan the stock incentive plan will be the primary vehicle our board will use to grant long term equity awards to participating associates equity awards are an important component of our overall compensation program for our management associates and during fiscal we granted equity awards to more than management associates our board believes that meaningful equity ownership at all levels of management contributes to shareholder value by aligning the interests of our associates with our shareholders and helps us to attract and retain talented associates in addition the stock incentive plan will be used to grant non management directors the equity portion of their non management director compensation which has historically been granted under the director compensation plan we are seeking shareholder approval of the stock incentive plan in accordance with the nyse listed company manual which generally requires shareholder approval of all material revisions to or an increase in the number of shares available under certain equity compensation plans and for purposes of section m of the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations thereunder in order for certain compensation to be considered performance based and therefore deductible under section m of the internal revenue code the performance measures applicable to that compensation must be approved by shareholders at least every five years since walmart has granted equity awards through the stock incentive plan which amended and restated walmarts stock incentive plan of the board adopted the stock incentive plan on march we have summarized below the material and other provisions of the stock incentive plan and identified the material amendments to the stock incentive plan that will be made if our shareholders approve the stock incentive plan appendix a to this proxy statement contains the text of the stock incentive

compliance with current laws and regulations table of contents u s tax consequences this summary is based on u s federal income tax laws currently in effect this summary does not constitute tax advice

for the grantee or walmart upon exercising a non qualified stock option the recipient will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock acquired and the stock option exercise price and walmart will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount in general if applicable holding period requirements are satisfied the recipient will have no taxable income upon the exercise of an incentive stock option except that the alternative minimum tax may apply and walmart will have no deduction with respect to an incentive

description of the application of u s federal income tax laws to certain types of awards under the stock incentive plan because of the variety of awards that may be made under the stock incentive plan and the complexities of the tax laws grantees of awards under the stock incentive plan should consult a tax advisor about their individual circumstances the board recommends that shareholders vote for

incentive plan used by many large united kingdom public companies including many retailers the features of the asda limited sharesave plan which are described below have been tailored to meet the applicable united kingdom tax and regulatory provisions thereby providing a tax efficient opportunity for eligible associates to purchase the companys shares and align the interests of associates with those of our shareholders on march the board adopted amendments to the asda limited sharesave plan previously approved by asdas board of directors if the amendments to the asda limited sharesave plan

the amendments are approved by our shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting and increase the number of shares available for issuance under the asda limited sharesave plan we are seeking shareholder approval of the asda limited sharesave plan as so amended in accordance with the nyse listed company manual which generally requires shareholder approval of all material revisions to or an increase in the number of shares available under certain equity compensation plans and to provide for the continued operation of the asda limited sharesave plan as amended options to purchase shares

for cash at an exercise price not less than the higher of the par value of a share and percent of the average of the closing prices of a share on the nyse on the three trading days before the business day preceding the offer date asdas board may delegate the authority to make grants to a committee but it has not done so offers of the options are made for periods of days generally beginning five days after walmart announces its quarterly results of operations no more than two offers may be made in each calendar year options granted under the asda limited sharesave plan are not transferable the persons eligible to receive options under the asda limited sharesave plan are associates of asda and of its subsidiaries who have been continuously employed by asda for at least six months these eligible associates are generally employed in the united kingdom currently there are approximately such eligible associates the aggregate maximum number of shares that may be acquired pursuant to options granted under the asda limited sharesave plan on or after june is plus the remaining shares available under the asda limited sharesave plan as in place on june which was approximately on march subject to adjustment and amendment as described below if an option was granted on or after june but lapses without having been exercised new options covering the shares that were subject to that lapsed option may be granted under the asda limited sharesave plan although an eligible associate is not required to make any payment to asda with respect to an option to be granted to the associate any eligible associate offered an option under the asda limited sharesave plan and who applies for that option must enter into a save as you earn contract referred to as a savings contract with an authorized financial institution approved by the united kingdoms hm revenue customs the option holder agrees to make monthly savings by payroll deduction of a fixed amount currently not less than or more than per month for a three year savings period upon expiration of the savings contract the option holder will be entitled to a tax free bonus from asda in addition to repayment of the savings contributions this bonus is the equivalent of further monthly contributions in lieu of interest the number of additional contributions is fixed by reference to a formula and confirmed by the u k treasury options are normally only exercisable within six months from the end of the savings contract and can only be exercised using the proceeds of the savings contract including the tax free bonus

other affiliate of asda employing the option holder ceases to be affiliated with asda the option holder reaches age the acquisition of control of walmart pursuant to a tender offer or the acquisition of more than half of the issued share capital of asda by a company not affiliated with walmart options generally lapse six months after becoming exercisable one year after becoming exercisable in the case of options that become exercisable as a result of the option holders death options also lapse upon the option holders being adjudicated bankrupt if an option holder does not retire at age he or she may choose to wait until the end of the savings contract before exercising the minimum amount of the option that may be exercised is ten percent of the total shares covered by the option the maximum number of shares that can be acquired is the number of shares whose aggregate purchase price under the option can be paid using the proceeds of the savings contract at that time table of contents if walmart is acquired by another company by tender offer that other company may agree to allow option holders to exchange options granted under the asda limited sharesave plan for new options for shares in that other company or one of its affiliates so long as the new options meet certain requirements intended to ensure that they are equivalent to the old options the united

under the asda limited sharesave plan the exercise price of options and the overall limits on shares available under the plan to reflect stock splits reverse stock splits and other similar events affecting the shares the asda limited sharesave plan may be amended by asdas board of directors at any time including in ways that may increase the costs of the asda limited sharesave plan to walmart however any material revision as defined by the nyse listed company manual or any increase in the number of shares available under the asda limited sharesave plan except pursuant to an adjustment described in the preceding paragraph must be approved by our shareholders no amendment to a key feature of the asda limited sharesave plan affecting tax approval will take effect unless and until approved by the united kingdoms hm revenue customs no amendment that adversely affects participants rights under options already granted may take effect without the consent of a majority of the affected participants tax consequences the asda limited sharesave plan is designed to enable the recipients of options to receive favorable tax treatment under the tax laws of the united kingdom walmart does not intend for associates who are u s taxpayers to receive options under the asda limited sharesave plan the following paragraphs provide a brief summary of these tax benefits for the option holder and asda respectively for the option holder subject to income tax in the united kingdom the principal tax consequences of the asda limited sharesave plan are that any bonus received

an option provided that the exercise takes place within the statutory time limits asda will be able to claim united kingdom corporation tax relief for the difference between the amount paid by the option holder on the exercise of options and the market value of the shares acquired upon exercise of the options at the time of their acquisition this relief is given for the tax period in which the option holder acquires the shares summary of amendments the asda limited sharesave plan s term will be extended indefinitely pursuant to the asda limited sharesave plan as in place on june no options could be granted under the plan after the tenth anniversary of its approval by the asda board of directors to ease the administrative burden associated with the adoption of a new plan every ten years the asda limited sharesave plan has been amended to remove this term limit if our shareholders approve the continued operation of the asda limited sharesave plan those amendments will be retroactively effective to january except for the increase of the number of shares available under the plan discussed below the asda limited sharesave plan as amended provides that any options granted to asda associates between january and june will lapse unless such shareholder approval for the continued operation of the asda limited sharesave plan is obtained the number of shares available under the asda limited sharesave plan will be increased without the amendments described herein the asda limited sharesave plan limits the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to options granted under such plan after june to million shares of which only shares remained available for issuance as of march to permit us to grant options under the asda limited sharesave plan in the future the asda limited sharesave plan as amended provides an additional million shares to be available for issuance pursuant to options granted on or after june the board believes this increase is necessary to continue to allow walmart to properly compensate and incentivize our asda associates we are not seeking to make any other material amendments to the asda limited sharesave plan at this time the table below shows options granted under the asda limited sharesave plan between january and march to the individuals and groups listed therein walmart cannot determine at this time the number of such options that will

group all non management directors as a group all non executive associates as a group the board recommends that shareholders vote for the approval and continued operation of the asda limited sharesave plan as amended shareholder proposals our company has received notice of the intention of shareholders to present six separate proposals for voting at the annual shareholders meeting the text of the shareholder proposals and supporting statements appear exactly as received by our company unless otherwise noted all statements contained in a shareholder proposal and supporting statement are the sole responsibility of the proponent of that shareholder proposal our company will provide the names addresses and shareholdings to our companys knowledge of the proponents of any shareholder proposal upon oral or written request made to mike bradshaw senior liaison to the board of directors southwest th street bentonville arkansas some of the shareholder proposals contain assertions about walmart or other matters that our company believes are incorrect but we have not attempted to refute all of those assertions the board recommends a vote against each of the following shareholder proposals based on broader policy reasons as set forth in walmarts statement in opposition following each shareholder proposal proposal no gender identity non discrimination policy whereas wal mart stores inc does not explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity or expression in its written employment policy yet wal marts policy already does explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation over of the fortune companies have adopted written nondiscrimination policies prohibiting harassment and discrimination on the basis of gender identity as well as leading private sector companies and eighty five u s colleges and universities according to the human rights campaign ninety three city and county governments and twelve states have passed clear gender identity and expression legislative protections including california colorado the district of columbia hawaii illinois maine minnesota new mexico pennsylvania rhode island vermont and washington over u s based human rights organizations and every u s state civil rights advocacy group has endorsed national legislation explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as gender identity our company has operations in and makes sales to institutions in states and cities that currently prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity we believe that corporations that prohibit discrimination both on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity have a competitive advantage in recruiting and retaining employees from the widest talent pool resolved the shareholders request that wal mart stores inc amend its written equal employment opportunity policy to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression and to substantially implement the policy table of contents supporting statement employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity diminishes employee morale and productivity because state and local laws are inconsistent with respect to such employment discrimination our company would benefit from a consistent corporate wide policy to enhance efforts to prevent discrimination resolve complaints internally and ensure a respectful and supportive atmosphere for all employees wal mart will enhance its competitive edge by joining the growing ranks of companies guaranteeing equal opportunity for all employees walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no as one of the worlds largest private employers we are dedicated to building and retaining an inclusive and respectful workplace walmart employs more than million associates worldwide including more than million associates in the united states our continued success as a business depends on an inclusive work environment that leverages the unique talents ideas perspectives and backgrounds of our associates sam walton founded our company by incorporating respect for the individual as a core basic belief in keeping with this belief we serve our associates by promoting an inclusive working environment through our employment practices in we received awards from national organizations and publications for our efforts to advance diversity and inclusion although the board is proud of the recognition that walmart has received for its achievements in diversity and inclusion the board recognizes that the true strength of diversity and inclusion lies not in the number of awards our company receives but in our commitment to leverage the rich mix of unique insights talents perspectives and experiences that each of our associates brings to our company one example of our companys ongoing efforts to fulfill its commitment to recognizing and celebrating the diversity of our associates is the creation of associate resource groups at our home office these groups serve a variety of associate communities including the lgbt community they were developed to increase cultural awareness to help foster development among associates sharing similar backgrounds and to advance the business by leveraging diversity of thought our companys discrimination harassment prevention policy makes clear that walmart will not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any aspect of our business on the basis of race color ancestry ethnicity religion sex pregnancy national origin age disability marital status veteran status sexual orientation genetic information or any other legally protected status in light of our companys ongoing concrete efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace for all of our associates and in view of the fact that this policy broadly prohibits discrimination or harassment based on any status protected by the law the board does not believe that a change to our discrimination harassment prevention policy is necessary at this time for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no advisory vote on executive compensation resolved that the shareholders of wal mart stores inc wal mart or the company urge the board of directors to adopt a policy under which shareholders could vote at each annual meeting on an advisory resolution to be proposed by wal marts management to ratify the compensation of the named executive officers neos set forth in the proxy statements summary compensation table the sct and the accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the sct but not the compensation discussion and analysis the proposal submitted to shareholders should make clear that the vote is non binding and would not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any neo supporting statement investors are increasingly concerned about mushrooming executive compensation that sometimes appears to be insufficiently aligned with the creation of shareholder value those concerns have only increased in the current economic downturn a recent sec rule which received record support from investors requires companies to disclose additional information about compensation and perquisites for top executives in adopting this rule the sec made it clear that market forces not the sec should provide checks and balances on compensation practices we believe that existing u s corporate governance arrangements including sec rules and stock exchange listing standards do not give shareholders enough mechanisms to provide input to boards on senior executive compensation by contrast public companies in the united kingdom allow shareholders to cast an advisory vote on the directors remuneration report which discloses executive compensation such a vote is not binding but gives shareholders a clear voice that could help shape senior executive compensation table of contents u s stock exchange listing standards require shareholder approval of equity based compensation plans but those plans set only general parameters and accord the compensation committee substantial discretion in making awards and establishing performance thresholds for a particular year shareholders do not have a means to provide ongoing feedback on the application of those general standards to individual pay packages see lucian bebchuk jesse fried pay without performance similarly performance criteria submitted for shareholder approval that would allow a company to deduct compensation in excess of million are broad and do not constrain compensation committees in setting performance targets for particular senior executives withholding votes from compensation committee members who are standing for reelection is a blunt and inadequate instrument for registering dissatisfaction with the way in which the committee has administered compensation plans and policies in the previous year accordingly we urge wal marts board to let shareholders express their opinion about senior executive compensation by establishing an annual referendum process the results of such a vote would we think provide wal mart with useful information about whether shareholders view the companys senior executive compensation as reported each year to be in shareholders best interests we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no we recognize the importance of executive compensation to our companys shareholders and understand the importance of administering our companys executive compensation program in a manner that conforms to the highest standards of corporate governance after careful consideration the board does not believe that the adoption of this proposal is in the best interests of walmarts shareholders and recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal for the following reasons the cngc which is comprised solely of independent directors oversees our executive compensation programs as described in the cda the cngc engages in a thorough and disciplined process and considers a wide range of factors when designing and establishing executive compensation the board believes that the cngc is in the best position to make executive compensation decisions and should have flexibility in making appropriate executive compensation decisions that will attract and retain the talent necessary to achieve walmarts business objectives we believe that the information we disclose in the cda and the executive compensation tables gives shareholders the insight needed to have confidence that our compensation processes are sound and that our executives are compensated in a manner that is consistent with the interests of our shareholders we believe that shareholders currently have the opportunity to provide feedback related to executive compensation as described in the corporate governance section of this proxy statement shareholders have various means including email and written correspondence to communicate with the entire board with the cngc or with individual directors by communicating directly with the board through these channels shareholders can provide specific feedback regarding our executive compensation philosophy practices and decisions we believe that this is a much more effective and accurate method of expressing particular observations concerns or criticisms related to our executive compensation than a simple for or against advisory vote which provides no meaningful insight regarding specific views or concerns that a shareholder may have for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no political contributions report resolved that the shareholders of wal mart company hereby request that the company provide a report updated semi annually disclosing the companys policies and procedures for political contributions and expenditures both direct and indirect made with corporate funds monetary and non monetary political contributions and expenditures not deductible under section e b of the internal revenue code including but not limited to contributions to or expenditures on behalf of political candidates political parties political committees and other political entities organized and operating under usc sec of the table of contents internal revenue code and any portion of any dues or similar payments made to any tax exempt organization that is used for an expenditure or contribution if made directly by the corporation would not be deductible under section e b of the internal revenue code the report shall include the following a an accounting through an itemized report that includes the identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each recipient of the companys funds that are used for political contributions or expenditures as described above b identification of the person or persons in the company who participated in making the decisions to make the political contribution or expenditure and c the internal guidelines or policies if any governing the companys political contributions and expenditures the report shall be presented to the board of directors audit committee or other relevant oversight committee and posted on the companys website to reduce costs to shareholders stockholder supporting statement as long term shareholders of wal mart we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities these activities include direct and indirect political contributions to candidates political parties or political organizations independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of a federal state or local candidate disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and critical for compliance with recent federal ethics legislation absent a system of accountability company assets can be used for policy objectives that may be inimical to the long term interests of and may pose risks to the company and its shareholders wal mart contributed at least million in corporate funds since the election cycle cqs politicalmoneyline http moneyline cq com pml home do and national institute on money in state politics http www followthemoney org index phtml however relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the companys political expenditures for example the companys payments to trade associations used for political activities are undisclosed and unknown in many cases even management does not know how trade associations use their companys money politically the proposal asks the company to disclose all of its political contributions including payments to trade associations and other tax exempt organizations this would bring our company in line with a growing number of leading companies including hewlett packard aetna and american electric power that support political disclosure and accountability and present this information on their websites the companys board and its shareholders need complete disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets thus we urge your support for this critical governance reform walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no our business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels we seek to be an effective participant in the political process by making prudent political contributions consistent with the federal state and local laws governing such contributions we are fully committed to complying with all laws concerning political contributions including laws requiring public disclosure federal law currently prohibits corporations from making contributions directly to candidates for federal office and to national party committees as a result walmart does not make such contributions some of our associates voluntarily fund a political action committee wal pac that makes political contributions to state and federal candidates political party committees and or political action committees the activities of wal pac are subject to comprehensive regulation by the federal government including detailed disclosure requirements wal pac files monthly reports of receipts and disbursements with the federal election commission the fec as well as pre election and post election fec reports all political contributions over are shown in public information made available by the fec under the lobbying disclosure act of walmart submits to congress semi annual reports which also are publicly available at the state level both walmarts and wal pacs political contributions also are subject to regulation although some states have not banned corporate contributions to candidates or political parties all states require that such contributions be disclosed either by the recipient or by the donor that information is also publicly available table of contents as a result of the disclosures mandated by law the board has concluded that ample disclosure exists regarding our political contributions to alleviate the concerns cited in this proposal in addition the board believes that the disclosure of the business rationale behind each political contribution as requested in this proposal would place our company at a competitive disadvantage by revealing our long term business strategies and priorities we are also involved in a number of legislative initiatives that could dramatically affect our business and operations because parties with adverse interests also participate in the political process for their own business reasons any unilaterally expanded disclosure by walmart could benefit these parties to the detriment of walmart and its shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no special shareowner meetings special shareowner meetings resolved shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary unilaterally to the fullest extent permitted by law to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders of of our outstanding common stock or the lowest percentage permitted by law above the power to call a special shareowner meeting this includes that multiple small shareowners can combine their holdings to equal the above threshold this includes that such bylaw and or charter text will not have any exception or exclusion conditions to the fullest extent permitted by law that apply only to shareowners but not to management and or the board and that shareholders will have no less rights at management called special meetings than management has at shareholder called special meetings to the fullest extent permitted by law a special meeting allows shareowners to vote on important matters such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings if shareowners cannot call a special meeting investor returns may suffer shareowners should have the ability to call a special meeting when a matter merits prompt attention this proposal does not impact our boards current power to call a special meeting this proposal topic also won more than support at the following companies in cvs caremark cvs sprint nextel s safeway swy motorola mot and r r donnelley rrd william steiner and nick rossi sponsored these proposals the merit of this special shareowner meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for improvements in our companys reported corporate governance status the corporate library www thecorporatelibrary com an independent investment research firm rated our company d with high governance risk and very high concern for executive pay million former ceo lee scott the corporate library said the walton family owned more than of our total outstanding shares this increased the risk that the interests of us minority shareholders were subordinated to the interests of the walton family especially when the two walton brothers were on our board chairman robson walton with years long tenure and director jim walton seven directors were either wal mart executives or had relationships with wal mart which could compromise their independence this raised multiple concerns regarding board independence we had no shareholder right to vote on executive pay call a special meeting cumulative voting or an independent board chairman shareholder proposals to address each of these topics have received majority votes at other companies and each would be an excellent topic for our next annual meeting we did not have a separate board committee for executive pay or nominations the above concerns show there is need for improvement please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal special shareowner meetings yes on walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no the board believes that adoption of this proposal would not be in the best interests of our company or its shareholders consistent with delaware corporate law our bylaws provide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called by a majority of the board by the chairman and by our president and ceo this is an appropriate corporate governance provision for a public table of contents company of our size because it allows our board according to its fiduciary obligations to exercise its business judgment to determine when it is in the best interests of shareholders to convene a special meeting permitting shareholders with as little as ten percent of the outstanding shares to call special meetings for any reason and at any time could result in special shareholders meetings that are not in the best interests of our company and all of its shareholders we take shareholders meetings very seriously and take steps to provide shareholders with access to our shareholders meetings including making our shareholders meetings available via webcast holding a special meeting of our shareholders would be a costly undertaking involve substantial planning and require us to commit significant resources and attention to the legal and logistical elements of such a meeting for example we would incur legal printing and mailing costs associated with preparing and distributing the disclosure documents required for a special shareholders meeting the board also believes that our companys existing governance policies and practices provide shareholders with access to the board and members of senior management and offer ample opportunity for shareholders to express their views to management these governance policies include the annual election of all board members and a majority voting requirement for the election of directors in addition shareholders may submit shareholder proposals which if appropriate under the secs rules may be included in our annual proxy statement and voted on at our annual shareholders meeting furthermore the rules governing companies listed on the nyse and incorporated under delaware law require us to submit certain matters to a vote of shareholders for approval such as mergers large share issuances or similar transactions and the approval of equity based compensation plans for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no poultry slaughter resolved that to advance the companys financial interests and the welfare of chickens and turkeys killed for its stores shareholders encourage the board to require the companys chicken and turkey suppliers to switch to animal welfare friendly controlled atmosphere killing cak a less cruel method of slaughter within five years supporting statement the current slaughter method used by many of wal mart stores poultry suppliers is cruel and inefficient consider the following many of wal mart stores poultry suppliers use electric immobilization in their slaughterhouses this involves shackling live birds shocking them with electrified water in a stun bath cutting their throats and removing their feathers in tanks of scalding hot water birds often suffer broken bones bruising and hemorrhaging during the shackling process which lowers product quality and yield they also peck and scratch at each other which increases carcass contamination because the electric current in the stun bath is kept too low to effectively render birds unconscious many have their throats cut while they are still able to feel pain birds are often scalded to death in defeathering tanks when this happens they often defecate further decreasing yield and increasing the likelihood of contamination frenzied birds flap their wings kick workers and vomit and defecate on them leading to increased worker injuries and illness and poor overall ergonomics cak is better for the birds welfare and more efficient consider the following benefits with cak birds who are still in their transport crates are placed in chambers where their oxygen is replaced with nonpoisonous gasses putting them to sleep every published report on cak and numerous meat industry scientific advisors including drs temple grandin mohan raj and ian duncan have concluded that it is superior to electric immobilization with regard to animal welfare because there is no live shackling or live scalding product quality and yield are greatly improved and contamination is drastically decreased the manager of a cak turkey plant in ohio told poultry usa that since switching to cak his company is starting to quantify the improvements in yield and labor and see the benefits in wings wing meat and breast meat because workers never handle live birds ergonomics improve injury and illness rates decrease and the opportunities for workers to abuse live birds are eliminated the turnover rate at a nebraska poultry plant dropped by percent after it installed a cak system table of contents the following companies are already moving toward cak burger king popeyes wendys hardees and carls jr give purchasing preference or consideration to chicken suppliers that use cak kfcs in canada ruby tuesday quiznos kroger ap harris teeter and winn dixie are sourcing chickens or turkeys killed by cak wal mart has the ability to leverage its financial and industry power to require its suppliers to adopt this less cruel method of slaughter for poultry and move the industry in the right direction we urge shareholders to support this socially and ethically responsible resolution walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no walmart supports humane animal handling practices by all of its suppliers we believe that controlled atmosphere killing cak and other emerging poultry and livestock processing technologies merit continued study and review but that the effects of cak on food safety and product quality for poultry in commercial operations and the benefits of cak to our customers remain unclear furthermore walmart remains concerned that new technologies like cak could raise concerns with respect to compliance with food regulations and certain religious food preparation standards as a result requiring that all of walmarts poultry suppliers convert to cak systems appears to be premature at this time walmart has not experienced any significant customer demand that it sell only poultry that has been processed using cak moreover conversion of a suppliers operations to cak only could be very expensive if we were to require our suppliers to convert to cak only operations within five years suppliers making the conversion could seek to increase the prices at which they sell their products to us in order to recoup the cost of the conversion some of those suppliers might decide not to continue selling products to walmart if walmart were to require such a conversion by a supplier and as a result paid increased prices for the suppliers poultry products walmarts financial results could be adversely affected in addition walmart might find it difficult to replace any lost suppliers with suppliers using cak only operations or who would sell poultry products to walmart at acceptable prices such a situation could affect walmarts ability to meet customer demand for poultry products walmart remains committed to humane treatment of animals by its suppliers and requires that all of its suppliers operations conform to applicable legal and prevailing industry standards for the handling and processing of poultry and livestock we intend to continue to monitor our suppliers operations and available processing methods to ensure that walmart continues to offer its customers affordable quality food products however the board believes that implementation of a requirement that all of walmarts poultry product suppliers use only cak in their processing operations would place walmart at a competitive disadvantage and would be contrary to the best interests of walmarts customers and its shareholders for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal proposal no lobbying priorities report whereas wal marts primary responsibility is to create shareholder value the company should pursue legal and ethical means to achieve that goal including identifying and advocating legislative and regulatory public policies that would advance company interests and shareholder value in a transparent and lawful manner resolved the shareholders request the board of directors at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information report to shareholders on the companys process for identifying and prioritizing legislative and regulatory public policy advocacy activities the report may describe the process by which the company identifies evaluates and prioritizes public policy issues of interest to the company describe the process by which the company enters into alliances associations coalitions and trade associations for the purpose of affecting public policy table of contents identify and describe public policy issues of interest to the company prioritize the issues by importance to creating shareholder value and explain the business rationale for prioritization statement of support the companys public policy positions and related advocacy activities should be developed and prioritized based on market and fact based analyses and not on pressure from politicians union bosses or anti business activists who are hostile to wal mart and its business model in a june letter to barack obama the wal mart ceo endorsed an employer mandate on business for health care coverage the chamber of commerce the national federation of independent business and the national retail federation all oppose such an employer mandate the wal mart letter was co signed by andrew stern president of the service employees international union seiu and john podesta president of the center for american progress cap seiu funds wal mart watch a vociferous wal mart critic seiu has a long relationship with the scandal plagued association of community organizations for reform now acorn both seiu and cap promote card check cap is funded in part by the foundation of billionaire george soros according to the wal mart sustainability report currently we aresupporting legislation in the u s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including the enactment of a well designed cap and trade system cap and trade would raise costs for all businesses a heritage foundation study estimated that the waxman markey cap and trade bill for instance would destroy over million jobs hike electricity rates percent and reduce the u s gross domestic product by nearly trillion over the next years at the same time wal mart has had a far lower profile on issues like tort liability reform corporate taxation capital gains tax increase double taxation of dividends and other issues of importance to the company and its shareholders embracing public policy positions that are contrary to the economic interests of consumers who buy company products or the preservation of the free enterprise system as a whole harms shareholder value absent a system of reporting shareholders cannot properly evaluate the companys process by which it takes prioritizes and promotes its public policy positions walmarts statement in opposition to proposal no as with most large global companies a wide range of public policies and legislative initiatives affect our company our operations our financial performance and the value of our stock those policies and initiatives relate to such varied matters as income tax rates tariffs on goods product safety environmental regulation renewable energy and interstate trucking and encompass many other laws rules and regulations impacting our companys business operations walmart addresses such public policy issues when and in a manner the board and our management decide are appropriate and in the best interests of our company the board believes that for walmart to pursue most effectively its own legislative and public policy initiatives and to preserve walmarts competitiveness in the marketplace the public policy issues of interest to walmart the priorities walmart gives to such issues the rationales for such prioritization if when and how walmart chooses to address those issues and how walmart determines to enter alliances and associations should not as a general rule be widely publicized the adoption and implementation of the proposal would result in public disclosure of such matters most if not all of walmarts competitors in the retail industry do not issue a report similar to the one the proposal requests if walmart were to issue such a report any strategic advantage as well as our ability to pursue our public policy initiatives effectively and without counterproductive or untimely publicity regarding our companys efforts could be negatively affected such effects of the requested report would not be in the best interests of our shareholders table of contents producing a report on such matters would be a complex and expensive undertaking an expense that in the opinion of the board would far outweigh any benefit to our shareholders further the policy issues affecting walmarts business operations often prove to be extraordinarily complex properly addressing such policy issues requires a detailed understanding of a complex set of facts the content of pending legislation can change swiftly and dramatically and may sometimes necessitate a change in our companys position on a particular piece of legislation because of the speed and urgency with which walmart may need to respond to public policy issues walmart cannot wait for the next shareholders meeting to seek guidance from its shareholders on whether or how to address such issues moreover which public policy issues are of interest to walmart and how those issues are identified and prioritized may change frequently in response to changing circumstances in sum the report requested by the proposal not only would impose an impediment to the effective conduct of walmarts public policy efforts but would also require an expenditure of walmarts resources and managements time that ultimately would not be in our shareholders best interests for the above reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal by order of the board of directors thomas d hyde secretary bentonville arkansas april table of contents appendix a wal mart stores inc stock incentive plan of as amended and restated effective june purpose and effective date wal mart stores inc
