the data to mitigate any issues and report any required information to regulators however that process can be time consuming inconsistent and prone to human error last year we tested technology that helps our associates by reviewing hundreds of records in seconds this technology not only reviews data quickly it also ensures that our review is consistent across our many locations and reduces human error were global ethics compliance program report using machine learning capabilities as well so this technology gets better and more accurate over time we are only beginning to digitize our

wide assortment of items on our ecommerce websites we aim to have the products our customers want and to make those products easy to find easy to order and competitively priced our third party
