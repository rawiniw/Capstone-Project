regarding non gaap financial measures unaudited in millions except per share data the following information provides reconciliations of certain non gaap financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has provided the non gaap financial information presented in the press release which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap such non gaap financial measures should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in the press release the non gaap financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies calculation of return on investment and return on assetsmanagement believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is deploying its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term potential strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was percentfor the fiscal year ended jan which was relatively flat compared to roi for the fiscal year ended jan the slight change in roi was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e commerce initiatives offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing months multiplied by a factor of when we have discontinued operations we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations our calculation of roi is considered a non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include a factor of for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets of continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roi as a result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows wal mart stores inc return on investment and return on assetsfiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominatoraverage total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assetsnumeratorincome from continuing operations denominatoraverage total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of january certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash flowwe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period free cash flow was billionand billionfor the fiscal years ended january and respectively the increase in free cash flow was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities as well as the timing of income tax payments combined with lower capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company s financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally walmart s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a company s free cash flow as a result the method used by walmart s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities fiscal years endedjanuary dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash used in investing activities includes payments for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow constant currency in discussing our operating results the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the u s dollar we calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period s currency exchange rates throughout our discussion we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations when we refer to constant currency operating results this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions if any until the acquisitions are included in both comparable periods the disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to understand better walmart s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions the table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total

included in both comparable periods underlying epsthe underlying diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart underlying eps for each of the three month periods and fiscal years ended jan and is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules because the underlying eps for each such period includes certain amounts not included in the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to walmart calculated in accordance with gaap eps for each of the three month periods and fiscal years ended jan and management believes that the underlying eps for each of the three month periods and fiscal years ended jan and is a meaningful metric to share with investors because that metric which adjusts eps for such period for certain items recorded in such period is the metric that best allows comparison of the performance for the comparable period in addition the metric affords investors a view of what management considers walmart s core earnings performance for each of the three month periods and fiscal years ended jan and and also affords investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance for the comparable period we have calculated the underlying eps for the three months and the fiscal year ended jan by adjusting the eps for each period for the amount of the dilutive impact of the effect of the wage and hour litigation matter wage and hour litigation matter and the closure of approximately underperforming stores in japan japan store closures underlying eps for
