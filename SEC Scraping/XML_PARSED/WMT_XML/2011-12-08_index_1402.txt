financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks such as market and credit risks market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change in a hedging relationship the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract the notional or contractual amount of the companys derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the companys exposure due to credit risk credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures including setting concentration limits by counterparty reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral generally cash from the counterparty if its derivative liability position exceeds certain thresholds the companys transactions are with counterparties rated a or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies in connection with various derivative agreements with counterparties the company held million in cash collateral from these counterparties at october it is the companys policy to record cash collateral exclusive of any derivative asset and any collateral holdings are reflected in its accrued liabilities as amounts due to the counterparties furthermore as part of the master netting arrangements with these counterparties the company is also required to post collateral if the derivative liability position exceeds million the company has no outstanding collateral postings and in the event of such the company would record the posting as a receivable exclusive of any derivative liability when the company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are table of contents recorded using hedge accounting if a derivative financial instrument is a hedge depending on the nature of the hedge changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of an instruments change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings during the period instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or contracts for which the company has not elected hedge accounting are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change fair value instruments the company is a party to receive fixed rate pay floating rate interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate debt under certain swap agreements the company pays floating rate interest and receives fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the instruments the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the companys exposure due to credit loss the companys interest rate swaps that receive fixed interest rate payments and pay floating interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges as the

is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in retail square feet of more than five percent comparable store and club sales are also referred to as same store sales by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in discussing the consolidated and operating results of our walmart international segment we sometimes refer to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates when we refer to changes in currency exchange rates or currency exchange rate fluctuations we are referring to the differences between the currency exchange rates we use to translate the walmart international segments financial results from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations are typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates respectively we use this method for all countries where the functional currency is not denominated in the u s dollar company performance metrics the companys performance metrics emphasize three priorities for improving shareholder value growth leverage and returns table of contents the companys priority of growth focuses on sales through comparable store or club sales and unit square feet growth the priority of leverage encompasses the companys objective to increase its operating income at a faster rate than the growth in net sales by growing its operating selling general and

operating expenses for the three and nine months ended october operating expenses increased and respectively when compared to the same periods in the prior year while net sales increased and over the same periods respectively other unallocated overhead expenses have increased for the three and nine month periods ended october our global ecommerce initiatives contributed to the majority of the increase in operating expenses as we continue to invest in our e commerce platforms including walmartlabs depreciation expense increased year over year based on our financial system investments with the remainder of the increase driven by multiple items none of which were individually significant for the three and nine months ended october we leveraged operating expenses operating income our operating income grew by and for the three and nine months ended october respectively when compared to the same periods in the prior year while net sales increased by and for the three and nine months respectively over the prior year although operating income increased for the three and nine month periods we did not meet our objective of growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales our gross profit margin declined primarily due to the impact of price investments and cost inflation while we leveraged operating expenses operating income for the three and nine months ended october included a currency translation benefit of million and million respectively from the walmart international segment volatility in currency exchange rates may continue to impact the companys operating income in the future returns return on investment management believes return on investment roi is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively walmart is employing its assets trends in roi can fluctuate over time as management balances long term strategic initiatives with possible short term impacts roi was and for the trailing month periods ended october and respectively the majority of the decline in roi was attributable to acquisitions completed in the second quarter of the current fiscal year we define roi as adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets of continuing operations plus accumulated depreciation and amortization less accounts payable and accrued liabilities for that period plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months multiplied by a factor of eight roi is considered a non gaap financial measure we consider return on assets roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is the most directly comparable financial measure to roi as we calculate that financial measure roi differs from roa which is income from continuing operations for the fiscal year or trailing twelve months divided by average total assets of continuing operations for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income adjusts total assets from continuing operations for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable and accrued liabilities and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital although roi is a standard financial metric numerous methods exist for calculating a companys roi as a result the method used by management to calculate roi may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their roi we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roi before comparing our roi to that of such other companies the calculation of roi along with a reconciliation to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is as follows table of contents forthetrailingtwelvemonthsendedoctober dollar amounts in millions calculation of return on investment numerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total assets of continuing operations average accumulated depreciation and amortization average accounts payable average accrued liabilities rent x average invested capital return on investment roi calculation of return on assets numerator income from continuing operations denominator average total assets of continuing operations return on assets roa as of october certain balance sheet data total assets of continuing operations accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts payable accrued liabilities the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by based on continuing operations only and therefore excludes the impact of discontinued operations total assets as of october and in the table above exclude assets of discontinued operations that are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of million million and million respectively free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period we generated free cash flow of billion and billion for the nine months ended october and respectively free cash flow increased due to a million increase in cash flows from operating activities partially offset by an approximately million increase in capital expenditures free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the companys financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity additionally our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for table of contents discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows although other companies report their free cash flow numerous methods may exist for calculating a companys free cash flow as a result the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of such other companies the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow a non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities a gaap measure which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities ninemonthsendedoctober amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities payments for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations is based

while acquisitions in our walmart international segment accounted for billion and billion respectively of the net sales increase over the comparable periods volatility in currency exchange rates may

leverage for the three months ended october our effective income tax rate was and for the three and nine months ended october respectively and and for the three and nine months ended october respectively the increases in the effective tax rate were primarily attributable to a million tax benefit related to changes in transfer pricing policies in a foreign tax jurisdiction during the three

rate include changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u s and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the u s statutory rate as a result of the factors discussed above we reported billion and billion of income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended october

ticket partially offset by a decline in customer traffic the increase in net sales for the nine months ended october was primarily due to a increase in year over year retail square feet partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales the decline in comparable store sales for the nine months ended october resulted from a reduction in customer traffic partially offset by an increase in average ticket gross profit margin declined slightly and was relatively flat for the three and nine months ended october respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year the slight decline in gross profit margin during the three month period was primarily due to our renewed focus on our price investment strategy to lower retail price points on numerous merchandise categories throughout the segment and higher cost inflation that was not passed on to our customers operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales declined slightly during the three and nine months ended october compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to improved labor productivity and our focus on cost control initiatives table of contents walmart international segment three and nine

as a percentage of net sales unit counts retail square feet net sales for the walmart international segment increased and for the three and nine months ended october respectively when compared to the

the three and nine months ended october respectively volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the sams club segment in the future gross profit margin decreased by and basis points for the three and nine months ended october respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year the gross profit margin decreases were driven by the highly competitive retail

october and respectively we generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and payments of dividends cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities generally consist of payments for property and equipment which were billion and billion during the nine months ended october and respectively these capital expenditures primarily relate to new store growth remodeling conversion and expansion costs for existing stores in addition we spent billion for the acquisition of massmart and netto during the nine months ended october we expect capital expenditures for property and equipment in the fiscal year ending january to range between billion and billion cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short and long term debt as well as dividends paid and the repurchase of company stock table of contents short term borrowings short term borrowings increased by billion at october compared to an increase of billion at october from time to time we utilize the liquidity under our short term borrowing programs to fund our operations dividend payments share repurchases and capital expenditures and for other cash requirements and corporate purposes on an

repurchase program from time to time the company has repurchased shares of its common stock under a billion share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on june and announced on june on june the companys board of directors replaced that share repurchase program which had approximately billion of remaining authorization for share repurchase as of that date with a new billion share repurchase program announced on june as a result the company terminated and will make no further share repurchases under the program announced on june as was the case with the replaced share repurchase program the new program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which the company can make share repurchases and will expire only when and if the company has repurchased billion of its shares under the newly authorized program or when it earlier terminates or replaces the newly authorized program any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status the company considers several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases including among other things its current cash needs its capacity for leverage

flows from continuing operations and proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings will be sufficient to finance seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and meet other cash requirements if our operating cash flows are not sufficient to pay dividends and to fund our capital expenditures we anticipate funding any shortfall in these expenditures with a combination of short term borrowings and long term debt we plan to refinance existing long term debt as it matures and may desire to obtain additional long term financing for other corporate purposes our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets has historically provided us with substantial sources of liquidity we anticipate no difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms will depend to a significant degree on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness continuing to be at or above the level of our current ratings at october the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long term debt were as follows rating agency commercialpaper long termdebt standard poors a aa moodys investors service p aa fitch ratings f aa dbrs limited r middle aa in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or any rated series of our outstanding long term debt issues were lowered or withdrawn for any reason or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of the companys long term debt securities were lower than those noted above our ability to access the debt markets would be adversely affected in addition in such a case our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt i e the rate of interest on any such indebtedness would be higher than our cost of funds had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating moreover each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies to
