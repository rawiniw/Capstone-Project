recognized at fair value with a corresponding adjustment to reflect these investments at contract value recent accounting pronouncements in january the fasb issued new accounting guidance that

value disclosures by investment class this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december except for certain level activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december the plan is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance retirement preservation fund investments the plans retirement preservation fund rpf or the fund is a stable value investment option for the plans participants only the rpf is invested in a money market fund a common collective trust the retirement preservation trust traditional guaranteed investment contracts gics and synthetic gics average duration for all investment contracts was years and years at january and respectively there are no reserves against the contract value for credit risk of the contracted issuer or otherwise traditional gics issued by an insurance company are valued by calculating the sum of the present values of all projected future cash flows of each investment the discount rate used is provided by other similar maturity investment contracts at year end the fair values of the synthetic gic wrapper contracts are calculated as the difference between the present value of the replacement cost of the wrapper contract and the present value of the contractually obligated payments in the original wrapper contract the underlying investments in the synthetic gics are debt securities that are traded primarily in over the counter markets and are valued at the last available bid price in the over the counter market or on the basis of values obtained by a pricing service the rpf enters into book value investment contracts bvcs also known as synthetic table of contents wal mart profit sharing and k plan notes to financial statements continued january retirement preservation fund investments continued investment contracts bvcs are comprised of both investment and contractual components the investment component consists of collective investment funds and a pooled portfolio of actively managed fixed income securities owned by the rpf referred to as covered assets this investment component is wrapped by contracts wrapper agreements issued by third party financial institutions generally insurance companies or banks wrapper providers these wrapper agreements generally provide for participant benefit withdrawals and investment transfers at the full contract value of the wrapper agreement i e principal plus accrued interest notwithstanding the actual market value of the underlying investments i e fair value of covered assets plus accrued interest in this manner wrapper agreements are designed to protect the fund from investment losses as a result of movements in interest rates however the wrapper agreements generally do not protect the fund from loss if an issuer of covered assets defaults on payments of principal or interest a default by the issuer of a covered asset or wrapper provider on its obligation could result in a decrease in the value of the funds assets the fund pays wrapper fees to the wrapper providers wrapper fees are negotiated separately with each issuer and are generally calculated based on a specified percentage of contract value in general if the contract value of the wrapper agreement exceeds the market value of the covered assets including accrued interest the wrapper provider becomes obligated to pay that difference to the fund in the event redemptions result in a total contract liquidation in the event there are partial redemptions that would otherwise cause the wrapper agreements crediting rate to fall below the wrapper provider is obligated to contribute to the fund an amount necessary to maintain the contracts crediting rate at not less than the circumstances under which payments are made and the timing of payments between the fund and the wrapper provider may vary based on the terms of the wrapper agreement a synthetic gic provides for a guaranteed principal plus any credited interest that has accrued over a specified period of time through benefit responsive wrapper contracts issued by a third party which are backed by underlying assets the fair value of the synthetic gics is approximately million and million at january and respectively included in the fair value of the synthetic gics is approximately million and million at january and respectively attributable to wrapper contracts all investment contracts held in the portfolio at january and are fully benefit responsive all contracts are effected directly between the rpf with merrill lynch as the trustee and the wrapper or issuer of the benefit responsive feature the rpf with merrill lynch as the trustee is prohibited from assigning or selling the contract to another party without the consent of the wrapper provider table of contents wal mart profit sharing and k plan notes to financial statements continued january retirement preservation fund investments continued all benefit responsive contracts held in the portfolio at january and require that either the repayment of principal and interest credited to participants in the rpf is a financial obligation of the issuer of the investment contract or a wrapper contract provides assurance that the interest crediting rate will not be less than zero no event has occurred such that realization of full contract value for a particular investment contract is no longer probable the rpf invests in the retirement preservation trust a stable value collective trust fund all investment contracts held in the retirement preservation trust have been individually evaluated for benefit responsiveness and all are fully benefit responsive there are no restrictions on access to funds for the payment of benefits the rpf allows participants daily access to the funds the terms of the investment contracts held in the portfolio at january and permit all participant initiated transactions with the rpf to occur at contract value with no conditions limits or restrictions permitted participant initiated transactions are those transactions allowed by the plan such as withdrawals for benefits or transfer to other funds within the plan the interest crediting rate for each investment contract is determined as follows the current dollar duration yield to maturity of the underlying investments plus or minus an adjustment for any difference between the contract value and fair value of securities taken over the contract value and the duration of the securities the key factors that could influence future crediting rates are changes to market interest rates changes in the market value of securities changes in the duration or weighted average life of securities and deposits or withdrawals to investment contracts all investment contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate all investment contracts are reset at least quarterly as interest rates rise the market value of the underlying securities declines and when interest rates fall the market value of the underlying securities rises the relationship to future interest crediting rates based on a change in interest rates up or down will generally have minimal impact on the crediting rate since the change in rates will generally be offset by the change in market value except when there is a change in duration duration is a measure of average life of all cash flows in the portfolio on a present value basis a change in duration when market values decline interest rates rise will reduce the crediting rate if duration shortens and increase the crediting rate if duration lengthens a change in duration when market values rise interest rates fall will increase the crediting rate when duration falls and decrease the crediting rate when duration rises finally any deposit or withdrawal to the investment contract will impact the crediting rate based on the relative size of the deposit or withdrawal table of contents wal mart profit sharing and k plan notes to financial statements continued january retirement preservation fund investments continued the average yield earned by the entire rpf which may differ from the interest rate credited to participants in the rpf was and during the years ended january and respectively this average yield was calculated by dividing the annualized earnings of all investments in the rpf irrespective of the interest rate credited to participants in the rpf by the fair value of all investments in the rpf the average yield earned by the entire rpf with an adjustment to reflect the actual interest rate credited to participants in the rpf was and at january and respectively this average yield was calculated by dividing the annualized earnings credited to participants in the rpf irrespective of the actual earnings of the investments in the rpf by the fair value of all investments in the rpf the type of events that could potentially limit the ability of the rpf to transact at contract value could include premature termination of the contracts by the plan location closings layoffs plan termination bankruptcy mergers and early retirement incentives the likelihood of the occurrence of these events that would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with the participants in the plan is not probable the rpf also maintains a liquidity protocol such that benefit responsive contracts are insulated in the portfolio access structure as of january and and respectively of portfolio assets insulate the benefit responsive contracts the issuer may terminate a benefit responsive contract with the rpf upon occurrence of certain events including but not limited to a failure of the rpf to comply with contractual requirements a material misrepresentation of the rpf failure to remain a qualified plan under the code or a merger or termination of the plan if such an event occurs and remains uncured the issuer may terminate at a settlement amount other than the contract value investments the trustee holds the plans investments and executes all investment transactions the plan invests in various investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and market risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants account balances and the amounts reported in the
