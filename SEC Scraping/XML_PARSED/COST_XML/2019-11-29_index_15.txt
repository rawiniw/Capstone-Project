experiences as established leaders in important areas of business and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every year the assessment seeks to identify specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences recommendations arising from the self assessment process in fiscal primarily

direction of the company while our non executive chairman facilitates our boards independent oversight of management promotes communication between management and our board and leads our boards consideration of key governance matters the board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate for the company at this time the role of the board in risk oversight one board function is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management reports on the potentially significant risks including without limitation cybersecurity matters that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate and oversees internal control over financial reporting the audit committee reports to the full board on its risk management tasks including the enterprise risk management review in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks

revealed significant concerns about the structure or operation of the company s compensation programs role of the compensation committeethe committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of messrs stanton chair and munger and mrs wilderotter the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used any the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers for the current fiscal year ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus program for the current fiscal year elements of compensationthe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation consisting solely of performance based rsus base salary cash bonuses and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages performance based rsus performance based rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time of grant the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation helps align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the shorter term with one year performance conditions and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention the committee s view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirements provide a long term dimension to the equity awards base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual increases cash bonus cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation and subject to caps are awarded at the discretion of the committee based on a variety of metrics they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses and the value of all equity related awards are in the committees view generally lower than those at other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest other compensation significant components of this compensation include health care and helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k and the deferred compensation plans the company provides no pensions for these officers these components of compensation mix incentives that are intended to reward shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of a one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent cash bonuses that are subject to one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the rsu award vesting of up to five years and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation and k plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by longer term incentives including equity awards that vest over up to five years and share ownership requirements which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests in addition the companys corporate governance guidelines give the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation earned by improper means peer companiesfor fiscal the committee primarily considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company lowes companies and bj s wholesale club holdings inc this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal except for the addition of bj s wholesale club which was included because it rejoined the public markets these companies were selected because they are recognized as successful retailers and two of them operate membership clubs the committee took into account that the current market capitalization of two of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensationif fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers rsu grants to all executive officers are performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that vesting over up to five years helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that subject to accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for taxes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period this accelerated vesting entitles officers and employees to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or of the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date for awards vesting on october all named executive officers received long service vesting the criteria for the fiscal performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or a increase in pre tax income with both measures based on local currencies and excluding the impact of a new revenue recognition standard the committee determined that both goals were exceeded accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for at least a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant for those not fully vested at the time the rsus were deemed earned dollar values for grants in fiscal based on the closing share price on the business day preceding the grant date were increased by approximately from the grant values in fiscal except that the increase for mr jelinek was higher the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants with exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all grants in fiscal were made under the companys seventh restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders in january on january shareholders approved the incentive plan which replaced the seventh restated stock incentive plan other compensationthe company provides the named executive officers with benefits of a type offered to all other employees in most respects the value of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company maintains a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of approximately employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that the first of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer there are company matching contributions for charitable contributions by employees including the named executive officers the committee believes the benefits are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officerin addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer near the end of calendar the committee approved a written employment contract for mr jelinek related to service during calendar for fiscal mr jelinek received an annual base salary of approximately based on a fifty two week year an increase of from the prior fiscal year the agreement further provided for a cash bonus of up to unchanged from the prior year determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control none of mr jelinek or any other employee has or had any change in control arrangement with the company for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr jelinek which in value at the grant date represented an increase of over the prior fiscal year the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service cash bonuses for the chief executive officer have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal mr jelinek earned a cash bonus of the bonus amount for mr jelinek was determined by the committee as follows i one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company s attainment of its pre tax income goal which was fully achieved in fiscal and ii eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to other executive officers are described below compensation of other named executive officersthe most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti portera moulton and murphy were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr jelinek and approved by the compensation committee before the grants the performance criteria were exceeded and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted with accelerated vesting for long service and further time based vesting salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels for these officers increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than mr jelinek received cash bonuses of up to slightly lower than the prior year bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee for the named executive officers of up to approximately of the eligible amounts as with other bonus eligible employees which number over of the bonus potential was related to the company s attainment of its internal pre tax income target for fiscal that target was billion on a generally accepted accounting principles basis the target was achieved as actual pre tax income was billion based on mr jelinek s recommendation the committee determined to award all of the potential pre tax income bonus eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the company s pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officer s area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pre tax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales and gross margin in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a small component approximately of total bonus eligibility based on the discretion of mr jelinek mr jelinek is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he considers what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances subject to the caps noted above the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendations but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time the bonuses are paid historically in november clawback policythe corporate governance guidelines provide that the company will seek to recover at the direction of the committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so incentive compensation including bonus incentive payment and equity award awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment where the incentive compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis the committee may determine in its discretion the amount if any by which the payment or award should be reduced in addition if an officer engaged in intentional misconduct as determined by the committee in its sole discretion that contributed to the award or payment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the misconduct the company may take other remedial and recovery action as determined by the committee stock ownership requirementsexecutive officers are required by the end of each calendar year to own and retain shares of company common stock representing in value at least three times seven times for the chief executive officer the base salary of the officer in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year newly promoted officers have twenty four months to achieve compliance the nominating and governance committee may authorize an extension should the timing present an undue burden all executive officers were in compliance at the end of calendar hedging and pledging policiesthe corporate governance guidelines as amended in august prohibit transactions involving hedging of the company s equity securities by directors officers and employees and prohibit pledging of the company s equity securities by directors and executive officers the prohibition on transactions involving hedging includes any instrument or transaction including put options and forward sale contracts through which an individual offsets or reduces exposure to the risk of price fluctuations in a corresponding equity security equity securities include common stock voting preferred stock and options and other securities exercisable for or convertible into settled in or measured by reference to any other equity security determined on an as exercised and as converted basis the equity securities attributable to a director or executive officer for these purposes are those attributable under either section or section of the securities exchange act of all directors and executive officers are in compliance with this policy conclusionthe committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the
