governance committee the functions of the nominating and governance committee are to identify and approve individuals qualified to serve as members of the board select director nominees for the annual meeting of shareholders evaluate the boards performance develop and recommend to the board corporate governance guidelines and provide oversight with respect to corporate governance and ethical conduct the members of the committee are messrs gates chair evans and raikes and ms ruckelshaus the committee is authorized by its charter to engage its own advisors the committee approved the nomination of the candidates reflected in proposal the board is responsible for nominating members for election to the board and for filling vacancies on the board that may occur between annual meetings of shareholders the committee is responsible for identifying screening and recommending to the board candidates for board membership when formulating its recommendations the committee will also consider advice and recommendations from others as it deems appropriate the committee met fourtimes in fiscal table of contentsthe committee will consider shareholder recommendations for candidates to serve on the board in accordance with our bylaws the name of any recommended candidate together with pertinent biographical information a document indicating the candidates willingness to serve if elected and evidence of the nominating shareholders ownership of company stock should be sent to the secretary of the company the company may require additional information as described in our bylaws our corporate governance guidelines provide that nominees for director will be selected on the basis of among other things knowledge experience skills expertise integrity diversity ability to make independent analytical inquiries and understanding of the companys business environment all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the board at the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the fourteen directors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business academia government service and other public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every third year the assessment seeks to identify specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences formal nomination of candidates by shareholders requires compliance with section of the bylaws there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines corporate governance guidelines the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines which may be viewed at www costco com through the investor relations page board structure the corporate governance guidelines provide that the board does not require the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer and shall be free to choose its chairman in any way that it deems best for the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately the board believes that this structure is appropriate for the company at this time as a co founder of the company mr brotman has played a critical role in the growth of the company and his role as chairman is complemented by the role of mr jelinek as president and chief executive officer and a more active participant in day to day management of the company in addition the board believes that it obtains effective additional board leadership through the role of the lead independent director currently filled by mr james the lead independent director presides over executive sessions of the board and otherwise facilitates communication among senior management and the non employee directors the role of the board in risk oversight one of the boards functions is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management reports on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate and oversees internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also table of contentsoften discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance

officer joseph p portera executive vice president coo eastern and canadian divisions and dennis r zook executive vice president coo southwest division and mexico table of contentscompensation philosophy and objectivesour compensation programs are designed to motivate our executives and employees and to participate in the growth of our business the company believes it has been very successful in attracting and retaining quality employees achieving low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the programs have contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes it is desirable to continue these programs at the annual meeting the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation was in favor the committee determined not to make any changes to the compensation programs as a result of the vote compensation levels approved by the committee for the named executive officers for fiscal are not materially changed from those approved for the prior year as part of approving grant levels for fiscal the committee reduced the number of rsus granted for nearly all grantees members of the board of directors the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board experienced grant reductions of executive officers experienced a reduction for most other grantees the reduction was or the reductions were taken in light of the substantial share price appreciation that has occurred since the inception of the rsu program in role of the compensation committeethe committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of dr carson chair mr munger and ms ruckelshaus the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used any the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensationthe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation since fiscal consisting solely of rsus and since fiscal solely of performance based rsus base salary cash bonuses and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and perquisites the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages performance based rsus performance based rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation above others helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the shorter term with the one year performance conditions and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention the committee s view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirement provide a significant long term dimension to the equity awards table of contentsbase salary base salary is the second largest compensation component this compensation is consistent with the need for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual adjustments cash bonus cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation and subject to caps are awarded at the discretion of the committee based on a variety of metrics they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements and perquisites consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest perquisites and other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k plan and the deferred compensation plan recognizing that the company does not have a traditional retirement plan the foregoing components of compensation combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the rsu award vesting of up to five years and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation plan and k retirement plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by longer term incentives including equity awards that vest up to five years and share ownership requirements which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests during fiscal moreover the board revised the companys corporate governance guidelines to include a claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that has been earned by improper means peer companiesfor fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company and lowes companies this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these companies were selected because they all are recognized as successful retailers and one of them represents the other major membership warehouse operator that is publicly traded in utilizing the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensationif fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers in the board determined to replace the stock option award program with awards of rsus since fiscal rsu grants to all executive officers have been performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon the executives maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that subject to accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest table of contentsover each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for minimum statutory withholding taxes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus beginning in fiscal all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period this accelerated vesting entitles officers and employees to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or of the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date the criteria for the fiscal performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or a increase in pre tax income with both measures based on local currencies after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were exceeded accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all rsu awards in fiscal were made under the companys sixth restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders and the only equity plan maintained by the company other compensationthe company provides the named executive officers with benefits of a type offered to all other employees in most respects the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that the first of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with certain perquisites including a car allowance the committee believes the benefits and perquisites are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the boardin addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these roles are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr jelinek related to service during fiscal as chief executive officer the agreement provided for an annual base salary of unchanged from the prior year the agreement further provided for a cash bonus of up to unchanged from prior year determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee mr brotman who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement mr brotman received a pay increase in fiscal to bring his salary in line with other executive officers he had not received a salary increase since apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control neither mr brotman nor mr jelinek nor any other employee has any change in control arrangement with the company table of contentsfor fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr brotman and mr jelinek the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service cash bonuses for the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal mr brotman and mr jelinek each earned a cash bonus of the bonus amounts for messrs brotman and jelinek were determined by the committee as follows i up to one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company s progress toward its pre tax income goal which as discussed below was not fully achieved in fiscal and ii eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to these executive officers are described below as explained below based on mr jelineks recommendation executive officers received a portion of the bonus potential associated with the pre tax income goal messrs brotman and jelinek along with mr galanti however declined receipt of any portion of this portion in light of the failure fully to meet the goal compensation of other named executive officersthe most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was the award of performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti portera and zook were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr jelinek as noted above the performance criteria were exceeded and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted with further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels for these officers increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than messrs brotman and jelinek received cash bonuses ranging from approximately to less than the prior year range bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee for most of the named executive officers of approximately of the eligible amounts up to as with other bonus eligible employees of the bonus potential was determined by the extent to which the company attained its internal pre tax income target for fiscal that target was billion on a generally accepted accounting principles basis of the target was achieved actual pre tax income was billion based on mr jelineks recommendation the committee determined to award a portion of the potential mr jelineks determination to recommend payment of a portion of the bonus was based on the narrow margin by which the target was missed and that a reason the target was not achieved was mr jelinek s decision to engage in more aggressive investment in price reductions reducing merchandise margin eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the companys pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pre tax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a small component approximately of total bonus eligibility based on the discretion of mr jelinek mr jelinek is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he considers what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances subject to the caps noted above the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendations but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year to be eligible for the annual bonus table of contentsthe individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november clawback policyin fiscal the company adopted a policy under which the company will seek to recover at the direction of the committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so incentive compensation including bonus incentive payment and equity award awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment where the incentive compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis the committee may determine in its discretion the amount if any by which the payment or award should be reduced in addition if an officer engaged in intentional misconduct as determined by the committee in its sole discretion that contributed to award or payment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the misconduct the company may take other remedial and recovery action as determined by the committee stock ownership requirementsall executive officers are required to and do own and maintain at least shares of common stock hedging and pledging policyin fiscal the board revised the corporate governance guidelines to prohibit transactions involving hedging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of the board and to prohibit pledging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of a designated trading committee which would review any risks of proposed transactions impact of tax considerationsthe committee examined compensation in light of the impact of section m of the internal revenue code of as amended which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of one million dollars in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders performance based rsus granted to named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception the committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service conclusionthe committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to its shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directorsthe compensation committee of the companys board of

under section m of the code extension of term of the plan the seventh restated incentive plan will expire on december but awards outstanding under the plan may extend beyond that date the seventh restated incentive plan and the companys governance policies contain a number of provisions that we believe are consistent with the interests of shareholders and sound corporate governance practices

the plan share reserve no liberal share counting the plan prohibits the reuse of shares withheld or delivered to satisfy the exercise price of an option or to satisfy tax withholding requirements no repricing of options the plan does not permit the repricing of options either by amending an existing award or by substituting a new award at a lower price without shareholder approval no discounted

or the consequences of any state local or foreign tax laws nonqualified stock options a participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option when a participant sells the shares the participant will have short term or long term capital gain or loss as the case may be equal to the difference between the amount the participant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold the tax basis of the shares generally will be equal to the greater of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date or the exercise price of the stock option incentive stock options a participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of an incentive stock option if a participant exercises an incentive stock option during employment or within three months after employment ends months in the case of permanent and total disability the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular u s federal income tax purposes although the participant generally will have taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option were a nonqualified stock option if a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option after the later of a one year from the date the participant exercised the option and b two years from the grant date of the stock option the participant generally will recognize long term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the participant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock option if a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before these holding period requirements are satisfied the disposition will constitute a disqualifying disposition and the participant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of disposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock option or if less the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of the stock option the balance of the participants gain on a disqualifying disposition if any will be taxed as short term or long term capital gain as the case may be with respect to both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already held by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon exercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the participant stock units a participant generally will not have taxable income upon the grant of stock unit awards instead the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of payout equal to the fair market value on the payout date of the shares received minus any amount paid cash based awards the u s federal income tax consequences of cash based awards will depend upon the specific terms of each award tax consequences to the company in the foregoing cases we generally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as a participant recognizes ordinary income subject to certain limitations imposed under the code section a of the code we intend that awards granted under the plan comply with or otherwise be exempt from section a of the code but make no representation or warranty to that effect tax withholding we are authorized to deduct or withhold from any award granted or payment due under the plan or require a participant to remit to us the amount of any withholding taxes due in respect of

articles of incorporationunder costco wholesales governing documents a simple majority vote standard that is the number of votes cast in favor exceed the number of votes cast against applies to nearly all matters submitted to a shareholder vote as permitted by washington law for decades our articles of incorporation articles have provided for three exceptions approval by two thirds of the shares outstanding is required to amend the articles regarding classification of the board and to amend the provision in article viii dealing with removal of directors only for cause andapproval by a majority of the shares outstanding is required for shareholders to remove a director for cause these proposals submitted by the board of directors seek shareholder approval of amendments to article viii to permit removal of a director from office for cause based on a simple majority vote and to remove the two thirds vote standard for amending article viii each proposal will be voted on separately and the effectiveness of either proposal is not conditioned on the approval of the other proposal purpose and effect of the proposalsthese proposals follow the board of directors ongoing review of our corporate governance principles including consideration of a non binding shareholder proposal approved by shareholders at the january annual meeting that proposal requested that our board take the steps necessary so that each voting requirement in our articles and bylaws that calls for greater than a simple majority vote be eliminated and replaced with a simple majority vote standard as disclosed in the proxy statement last year shareholder table of contentsapproval of that proposal did not itself amend the articles the board must first authorize any amendments to the articles and shareholders must then approve each amendment with an affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors though approved by a majority of the votes cast the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal presented at the january annual meeting represented substantially less than the two thirds threshold necessary to amend the applicable provisions of the articles after further analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of reducing the voting requirements and taking into account the results of the advisory vote the board has determined to submit these proposals to shareholders for a vote the board recognized that the current voting standards are designed to protect shareholders interests because they ensure a broader shareholder voice in a very important yet highly unlikely event of a vote on removing a director the board also considered the following factors our articles provide that a director may be removed by the shareholders only for cause as defined in our articles at a special meeting called for that purpose by shareholders of record holding at least of the shares outstanding cause is defined narrowly i conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction and such conviction is no longer subject to direct appeal or ii adjudication for gross negligence or dishonest conduct in the performance of a director s duty to the corporation by a court of competent jurisdiction and such adjudication is no longer subject to direct appeal the director removal provision is not an impediment to other shareholder rights regarding directors shareholders are permitted to nominate director candidates and can vote for certain directors each year at the annual meeting if in any uncontested election of directors a nominee receives a greater number of withhold votes than votes for the nominee will offer his or her resignation to the board a committee of independent directors whose election is not at issue will determine and publicly report the action to be taken with respect to the resignation offer the board believes that the proposals strike an appropriate balance between the boards continuing efforts to protect shareholder interests while remaining responsive to corporate governance concerns proposal a reduce voting standard for removal of directorsunder article viii of our current articles subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock a director may be removed only for cause and only by approval of a majority of the shares outstanding as opposed to a simple majority proposal a would amend article viii as set forth below under the heading text of the proposed amendment to article viii of the articles of incorporation to change the voting standard so that a director may be removed for cause if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove the director for proposal a to be approved an affirmative vote is required of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if approved by the required vote proposal a would be effected by filing of articles of amendment to the articles of incorporation proposal b reduce voting standard for future amendment of article viii of the articles of incorporation under our current articles which governs the removal of directors only for cause article viii may only be altered or eliminated by an amendment approved by two thirds of the shares outstanding proposal b would amend article viii as set forth below under the heading text of the proposed amendment to article viii of the articles of incorporation to remove the supermajority vote standard for amending article viii for proposal b to be approved an affirmative vote is required of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if approved by the required vote proposal b would be effected by filing of articles of amendment to the articles of incorporation table of contentsboard classification the proposed amendments do not modify the two thirds voting standard for amending the provision in the articles regarding classification of the board of directors following passage of a shareholder proposal at the annual meeting urging the board to take steps to amend the articles to eliminate classification of the board the board afforded shareholders the opportunity at the january annual meeting to vote on a proposal to amend the articles to change the method of electing directors as explained in the proxy statement last year since the company went public in its articles have required that directors be elected for three year terms and that approximately one third of the board seats are up for election every year the board believes that this classified board structure has contributed to the companys long term operational success and delivery of strong shareholder returns nevertheless the board submitted a declassification proposal to the companys shareholders to give shareholders an opportunity to cast a binding vote on the matter the board made no recommendationas to voting for or against the amendment but each director advised the company that as a shareholder he or she intended to vote againstthe proposal this proposed amendment failed not only to achieve the two thirds threshold necessary to approve the amendment by almost million shares it failed to obtain the vote of even a majority of shares outstanding the company did not receive this year a shareholder proposal for declassification the board continues to believe that at this time the classified structure should be retained and that the two thirds voting requirement to amend the structure serves to retain that structure absent broad shareholder support to declassify the board became aware in january of a third party recommendation that shareholders withhold voting in favor of directors standing for re election at the january annual meeting because of a claimed failure by the board to implement the advisory shareholder proposal passed in calling for declassification of the board this was based on the boards decision to make no recommendation as to the declassification amendment put before the shareholders in january the board believes that this recommendation was unwarranted for a number of reasons the vote afforded all shareholders an unimpeded opportunity to vote for declassification the absence of a board recommendation did not pre determine the outcome of that vote indeed in the companys experience increasingly shareholders cast their votes based not on the recommendation of any person or group but on their own objective assessments of the matters at hand andthe directors standing for re election and the entire board of directors had overseen operating and financial performance of the company that was quite favorable by well established measures such that a disagreement about a single issue whether to recommend declassification did not warrant removing these individuals entirely from board service text of the proposed amendments to article viii of the articles of incorporationset forth below is the text of article viii of our articles of incorporation as it would be amended by proposals a and b in both cases deletions and additions to the current article viii of our articles of incorporation are indicated by strikeouts and by underlining respectively

board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote for proposals a and b in response to a shareholder proposal if properly presented at the meeting the company will hold a vote on the following proposal reduce director entrenchmentresolved shareholders request adoption of a bylaw that would require at least of the board of directors to have less than years total costco director tenure this would include a provision that management would have the discretion to implement an orderly return to this requirement should there be a temporary deviation in meeting this requirement eight out of the costco directors had greater than years tenure this included charles munger john meisenbach and richard libenson who each received a whopping to in negative votes at our annual meeting plus mr munger was unfortunately assigned to our audit and executive pay committees costco had not disclosed specific quantifiable performance target objectives for our ceo who was reported to be given million in total realized pay in gmi ratings an independent investment research firm flagged the costco board as potentially entrenched due to the high number of long serving directors these concerns were aggravated by additional factors such as year terms for directors the lack of an independent chairman which together with the high number of long tenured directors raised concerns about whether the costco board was able to provide an effective counterbalance to management costco also had inside directors further compounded by inside related directors gmi also said multiple related party transactions and other potential conflicts of interest involving the companys board or senior managers should be reviewed in greater depth as such practices raise concerns regarding potential self dealing or abuse in the society of corporate secretaries said excessive director tenure will now impact a companys rating by a proxy advisory firm in costco shareholders approved a shareholder proposal by about a to one ratio to establish a more democratic method to determine changes in certain corporate governance issues to replace certain voting thresholds with thresholds it is believed that most of the support for this reduce director entrenchment proposal will be from shareholders who voted for the shareholder proposal an added incentive to vote for this proposal is costcos clearly improvable corporate performance these issues were part of a report table of contentscostco paid million to settle a nationwide lawsuit by female employees who accused costco of discriminating against women in promotions to management jobs costco was ordered to pay for food safety breaches after a severe mice infestation was found at a store regulators announced that costco would pay million in fines in a settlement over improper storage handling and disposal of hazardous waste and pharmaceutical waste in many stores a news release said costco violated california safe storage laws over five years at numerous costco stores and distribution facilities upscale fashion accessories maker michael kors sued costco accusing costco of running a bait and switch false advertising scheme returning to the core topic of this proposal from the context of our clearly improvable corporate performance please vote to protect shareholder value reduce director entrenchment proposal board of directors responseyour board of directors believes that imposing mandatory limits on director tenure is not in the best interests of our shareholders because it would arbitrarily deprive costco of qualified experienced and effective directors experienced directors support costcos long term approach to creating shareholder valuecostco takes a long term approach to generate shareholder value the current board including those with tenure exceeding fifteen years has overseen consistent long term growth in the financial and operating performance of the company and returns to shareholders source thomson reuters market data as of november note total return includes reinvestment of dividends key comps group includes kroger target and walmart large cap retailers group includes best buy kohl s lowe s safeway staples and walgreens table of contentslong serving outside directors have added important experience and organizational memory the board believes that this knowledge and perspective are particularly important for the companys uniquely long term horizon in dealing with its customers employees and suppliers employees working in the companys membership warehouses receive pay and benefits more generous than their counterparts at competitors this long term investment in its workforce has benefited the company with greater loyalty and the company consequently benefits through what it believes to be the lowest employee turnover rates and the lowest inventory loss rate in the industry through its investments in lower pricing bringing merchandise to market with the lowest cost through expense control and minimal mark ups the company has developed what it believes to be a very strong reputation among its members for pricing authority offering the most competitive prices that strategy has resulted in long term customer loyalty with over of members renewing their memberships and strong growth in member warehouse visits in recent years the board processes adequately consider tenurethe board appreciates that an increasing number of shareholders view tenure of directors individually and as a group as a relevant consideration in director elections the nominating and governance committee which is composed exclusively of independent directors with an average tenure of less than fifteen years oversees an evaluation process for the board of directors and its committees that evaluation process includes consideration of tenure the committee also reviews tenure as one factor in determining whether board members should be nominated for re election the average tenure for all independent directors is less than years two of the longest tenured board members over thirty years are the company s founders jeffrey brotman and james sinegal both of whom the board believes currently make invaluable contributions to the board tenure is also a consideration in the ongoing nominating committee and board process concerning director succession the board and the committee have been actively engaged since the last annual meeting in a search for director candidates the objectives in the refreshment process include among other things seeking to ensure that the skill mix of the directors matches the evolving nature of the company s business reducing over time the number of directors who are not independent under regulatory and listing requirements enhancing diversity and bringing individuals who add new perspectives the objective at this time is to bring on new members without increasing the size of the board thus far the process has not yielded nominations but the board expects such nominations to occur prior to the annual meeting in the proponents cite no evidence that the companys performance has been hampered by director tenure that arbitrary limits on tenure would lead to improved results or that existing processes cannot be relied upon to ensure a proper composition of the board going forward the board further understands that only a tiny minority of public companies in the united states has mandatory term limits the board believes that this proposals arbitrary limitation on director tenure is unnecessary and counterproductive to the boards ability to nominate for shareholder approval the best candidates to lead the company the board therefore recommends a vote against proposal the company will provide the
