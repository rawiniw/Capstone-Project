an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date this guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs that may be used are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data the following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value level primarily
