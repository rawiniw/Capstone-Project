perceived needs of the board at the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the tendirectors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important

of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences recommendations arising from the self assessment process in fiscal primarily related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of

primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the company while our non executive chairman facilitates our boards independent oversight of management promotes communication between management and our board and leads our boards consideration of key governance matters the board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate for the company at this time the role of the board in risk oversight one board function is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the

programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management reports on the potentially significant risks including without limitation cybersecurity matters that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate and oversees internal control over financial reporting the audit committee reports to the full board on its risk management tasks including the enterprise risk management review in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs

compensation philosophy and objectivesour compensation programs are designed to motivate our executives and employees and enable them to participate in the growth of our business the company believes it has been very successful in attracting and retaining quality employees generally achieving low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the programs have contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes it is desirable to continue these programs at the annual meeting the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation was in favor the committee did not determine to make any changes to the compensation programs as a result of the vote compensation levels approved by the committee for the named executive officers for fiscal did not materially change from those approved for the prior year discussions by certain directors and management with a number of shareholders since the annual meeting have not revealed significant concerns about the structure or operation of the company s compensation programs role of the compensation committeethe committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of messrs stanton chair and munger and

salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus program for the current fiscal year elements of compensationthe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation consisting solely of performance based rsus base salary cash bonuses and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages performance based rsus performance based rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation helps align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the shorter term with the one year performance conditions and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention the committee s view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirements provide a long term dimension to the equity awards base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual increases cash bonus cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation and subject to caps are awarded at the discretion of the committee based on a variety of metrics they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view generally lower than those at other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k and the deferred compensation plans these components of compensation mix incentives that are intended to reward shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of a one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent cash bonuses that are subject to one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the rsu award vesting of up to five years and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation and k plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by longer term incentives including equity awards that vest up to five years and share ownership requirements which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests in addition the companys corporate governance guidelines include a claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation earned by improper means peer companiesfor fiscal the committee primarily considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company and lowes companies this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these companies were selected because they are recognized as successful retailers and one of them represents the other major membership warehouse operator that was publicly traded for the whole fiscal year the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensationif fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers rsu grants to all executive officers are performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that subject to accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for taxes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period this accelerated vesting entitles officers and employees to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or of the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date the criteria for the fiscal performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or a increase in pre tax income with both measures based on local currencies after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were exceeded accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for at least a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant for those not fully vested at the time the rsus were deemed earned dollar values for grants in fiscal based on the closing share price on the business day preceding the grant date were increased by approximately from the grant values in fiscal except that the increase for mr jelinek was higher the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants with exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all grants in fiscal were made under the companys seventh restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders in january and currently the company s only equity plan other compensationthe company provides the named executive officers with benefits of a type offered to all other employees in most respects the value of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain eligible employees approximately including the named executive officers the plan provides that the first of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with a car allowance there is a company match for certain charitable contributions the committee believes the benefits are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officerin addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr jelinek related to service during fiscal subsequently extended to calendar as chief executive officer for fiscal mr jelinek received an annual base salary of based on a fifty two week year an increase of from the prior fiscal year the agreement further provided for a cash bonus of up to unchanged from the prior year determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control none of mr jelinek or any other employee has or had any change in control arrangement with the company for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr jelinek which in value at the grant date represented an increase of over the prior fiscal year the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service cash bonuses for the chief executive officer have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal mr jelinek earned a cash bonus of the bonus amount for mr jelinek was determined by the committee as follows i one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company s attainment of its pre tax income goal which was fully achieved in fiscal and ii eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to these executive officers are described below with respect to the former half although the companys performance entitled mr jelinek to payment he declined to receive it because of the companys determination that it had a material weakness in internal control during the fiscal year related to ineffective information technology general controls the committee concurred with mr jelineks request the criteria governing bonuses to other executive officers are described below compensation of other named executive officersthe most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti portera moulton and murphy were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr jelinek and approved by the compensation committee before grant as noted above the performance criteria were exceeded and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted with accelerated vesting for long service and further time based vesting salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels for these officers increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than mr jelinek received cash bonuses of up to slightly higher than the prior year because of improved operating performance bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee for the named executive officers of up to approximately of the eligible amounts based on the recommendation of mr jelinek the committee reduced the bonuses payable to mr galanti and mr moulton due the companys determination that it had a material weakness in internal control at the end of fiscal in areas falling within the oversight of these two officers as with other bonus eligible employees of the bonus potential was related to the company s attainment of its internal pre tax income target for fiscal that target was billion on a generally accepted accounting principles basis the target was achieved as actual pre tax income was billion based on mr jelinek s recommendation the committee determined to award all of the potential pre tax income bonus except as described above eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the company s pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officer s area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pre tax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales and gross margin in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a small component approximately of total bonus eligibility based on the discretion of mr jelinek mr jelinek is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he considers what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances subject to the caps noted above the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendations but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november clawback policythe corporate governance guidelines provide that the company will seek to recover at the direction of the committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so incentive compensation including bonus incentive payment and equity award awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment where the incentive compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis the committee may determine in its discretion the amount if any by which the payment or award should be reduced in addition if an officer engaged in intentional misconduct as determined by the committee in its sole discretion that contributed to the award or payment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the misconduct the company may take other remedial and recovery action as determined by the committee stock ownership requirementsexecutive officers are required by the end of each calendar year to own and retain shares of company common stock representing in value at least three times seven times for the chief executive officer the base salary of the officer in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year newly promoted officers have twenty four months to achieve compliance the nominating and governance committee may authorize an extension should the timing present an undue burden hedging and pledging policythe corporate governance guidelines as amended in august prohibit transactions involving hedging of company shares by directors officers and employees and prohibit pledging of company shares by directors and executive officers impact of tax considerationsour rsu grants impose performance conditions for the ceo and executive vice presidents these conditions for fiscal and prior years were intended to qualify the awards as tax deductible under section m of the internal revenue code as a result of changes in december to federal tax laws we expect that equity awards granted or other compensation provided under arrangements entered into or materially modified after november generally will not be deductible to the extent they result in compensation to certain executive officers that exceeds million in any one year for any such officer due to uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of section m including the scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing the exemption the section m deduction limit no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption in fact will do so because of the importance of linking pay and performance rsu grants made for fiscal continued to impose performance conditions on grants to the ceo and executive officers conclusionthe committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team

the plan who are subject to u s federal taxes the summary is based on the code applicable treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and is therefore subject to future changes in the law possibly with retroactive effect the summary is general in nature and does not purport to be legal or tax advice furthermore the summary does not address issues relating to any u s gift or estate tax consequences or the consequences of any state local or foreign tax laws stock options although there is no current intention to grant stock options under the under the plan generally if granted they would be non qualified stock options the grant of stock options does not cause any tax consequences to the participant at the time of grant upon the exercise of a non qualified stock option the excess of the market value of the shares acquired over their exercise price is ordinary income to the participant the participants tax basis for the shares is the market value thereof at the time of exercise stock units a participant generally will not have taxable income upon the grant of stock unit awards instead the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of payout equal to the fair market value on the payout date of the shares received minus any amount paid cash based awards the u s federal income tax consequences of cash based awards will depend upon the specific terms of each award tax consequences to the company in the foregoing cases we generally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as a participant recognizes ordinary income subject to certain limitations imposed under the code section a of the code we intend that awards granted under the plan comply with or otherwise be exempt from section a of the code but make no representation or warranty to that effect tax withholding we are authorized to deduct or withhold from any award granted or payment due under the plan or require a participant to remit to us the amount of any withholding taxes due in respect of the award or payment and to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy all

articles of incorporation the articles provide that the board of directors is divided into three classes with each class being elected every three years the board has unanimously adopted and recommends that shareholders approve an amendment to the articles that would declassify the board so that all directors stand for election annually the board with the assistance of the nominating and governance committee regularly reviews our corporate governance practices to ensure that such practices including the procedure for electing directors remain in the best interests of the company and our shareholders at the annual meeting shareholders approved a non binding shareholder proposal calling for the board to take the steps necessary to declassify the board after this vote the board again reviewed the benefits and harms of declassification and solicited input from a number of our largest shareholders as a result of this review the board determined that shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to vote at the annual meeting on amending the articles to declassify the board but that it would make no recommendation that shareholders vote for or against the proposal the proposal received a majority of the votes cast but did not receive the vote of two thirds of shares outstanding required for passage while the board continues to believe that there are important benefits to a classified board structure it recognizes the potential advantages of declassification including the ability of shareholders to evaluate directors annually the board also recognizes the growing sentiment among shareholders and the investment community in favor of annual elections after carefully weighing these and other factors including that the number of companies with classified boards continues to decline the board has determined that is it is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders to declassify the board and recommends that shareholders approve the proposed amendment if the proposed amendment is approved by the shareholders the classified board structure will be phased in over a three year period beginning at the annual meeting directors elected to three year terms prior to the effectiveness of the proposed amendment including the class ii directors elected at this annual meeting will complete those terms the term of the class iii directors is set to expire at the annual meeting and the term of the class i directors is set to expire at the annual meeting at which meetings the directors will stand for election on an annual basis for one year terms beginning with the annual meeting all directors will stand for election annually vote requiredfor the proposed amendment to be approved an affirmative vote is required of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors if approved by the required vote the proposed amendment will become legally effective upon the filing of articles of amendment with the washington secretary of state which we intend to do shortly after the annual meeting a corresponding amendment to our bylaws will become automatically effective upon

reason of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors the board of directors shall designate one or more directorships whose terms then expire as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality in the number of directors among the classes when the board of directors fills a vacancy resulting from the death resignation or removal of a director the director chosen to fill that vacancy shall be of the same class as the director he succeeds notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of article v in all cases including upon any change in the authorized number of directors each director then continuing to serve as such will nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he is a member until the expiration of his current term or his earlier death resignation or removal any vacancy to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders notwithstanding anything contained in this article v to the contrary the classification of directors as provide in this article v may be altered or eliminated only by an amendment to this article approved by two third of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to vote on such amendment subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock then outstanding commencing with the annual meeting of shareholders in directors shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders provided however that any director elected prior to the annual meeting of shareholders in for a term that expires at the annual meeting of shareholders in or the annual meeting of shareholders in shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected the division of directors into classes shall terminate at the annual meeting of shareholders in from and after which all directors will stand for election annually in the case of any vacancy on the board of directors including a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors the vacancy may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing until the next election of directors by the shareholders notwithstanding anything contained in this article v to the contrary each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified until there is a decrease in the number of directors or until the directors earlier death resignation or removal provided however that no reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that directors term of office expires the board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote for proposal proposal approval of an amendment to the articles of incorporation to eliminate a supermajority vote requirement in the event proposal is not approved by shareholders at the annual meeting the board of directors has unanimously adopted and recommends that shareholders approve a separate amendment to article v of the companys articles of incorporation that would remove the supermajority provision in the articles requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to declassify the board if proposal to amend the articles to declassify the board is approved by shareholders the separate vote of shareholders on proposal will be unnecessary and the board will disregard any votes on proposal nevertheless we are bringing this proposal in order to be responsive to a non binding shareholder proposal approved by shareholders at the annual meeting calling for elimination of supermajority vote requirements if proposal is not approved by shareholders the company will retain its classified board structure in such case the board has determined it is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders to afford our shareholders the opportunity to separately vote to remove the remaining supermajority vote provision in the articles currently article v of the articles provides that classification of directors may be altered or eliminated only by an amendment approved by not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors if the shareholders approve proposal then all future amendments to article v would require approval by a simple majority of all the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors which is the minimum standard required by laws of the state of washington and the standard for amendment to all other provisions of the articles the board has given careful consideration to reducing the supermajority vote provisions in the articles to a simple majority vote at the annual meeting shareholders approved a non binding shareholder proposal calling for the board to take the steps necessary to remove all supermajority voting provisions from the companys articles and bylaws at the annual meeting management submitted a proposal to shareholders to remove all the supermajority vote requirements in the articles other than for classification of the board that proposal was approved by shareholders and has been implemented at the annual meeting shareholders approved a non binding shareholder proposal calling for the board to take the steps necessary to remove all supermajority voting provisions from the companys articles and bylaws while the board considered the purpose of the remaining supermajority provision to retain the classified board structure absent broad shareholder support to declassify it recognized the growing sentiment among the companys shareholders and the investment community to eliminate all supermajority voting provisions after further analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of eliminating the remaining supermajority vote standard the board is submitting the proposed amendment to shareholders for approval vote required for the proposed amendment to be approved an affirmative vote is required of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors if approved by the required vote the proposed amendment will become legally effective upon the filing of articles of amendment with the washington secretary of state which we intend to do shortly after the annual meeting unless proposal approved by shareholders in which case we will file articles of amendment as described in proposal text of the proposed amendmentarticle v of the articles is amended to delete the last paragraph in its entirety as shown in the marked out text below the full text of the companys amended and restated articles of incorporation as amended can be found on our website at www costco com through the investor relations page notwithstanding anything contained in this article v to the contrary the classification of directors as provide in this article v may be altered or eliminated only by an amendment to this article approved by two third of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to vote on such amendment the board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote for proposal proposal report on prison labor in the supply chainin response to a shareholder proposal if properly presented at the meeting the company will hold a vote on the following whereas the use of services derived from or sale of goods produced through correctional industries prison labor can pose financial and operational risks including supply chain disruption litigation and reputational damage prison labor both voluntary and involuntary is often deployed in a manner that involves prisoner mistreatment and is frequently compared to modern slavery although companies benefit from low overhead expenses when inmates work for the company or its suppliers companies have experienced public backlash boycotts and long term brand name and reputation harm from a connection to prison labor prisoners are involved in producing a variety of products such as furniture circuit boards packaging materials electronic equipment and providing services such as call center or shipping services u s prisoners may be paid as little as per hour for work that sometimes occurs in unsafe or unhealthy conditions and in some prison industries inmates may be coerced into working by threat of punishment for declining work after shareholder engagement in our company disclosed knowledge of prison labor in at least one segment of the companys supply chain in mid costco adopted a global policy on prison labor which lays out minimum requirements for purchasing products made by prison labor including payment of wages on par with non incarcerated persons in the same geographic area and states that t hird party audits must be able to verify compliance with the above requirements however to the proponent s knowledge there is no requirement for routine verification that suppliers using prison labor are adhering to this company policy careful review of our supply chain for adherence to our companys global policy on prison labor would help ensure that costco suppliers are consistent with company policies and minimize risks to costcos reputation and shareholder value resolved shareholders of costco urge the board of directors to produce an annual report to shareholders at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information regarding information known to the company regarding supplier compliance with the companys global policy on prison labor supporting statement shareholders recommend that the report provide annual quantitative metrics regarding the number of supplier audits completed by the company or third party auditors that evaluated whether prison labor is present in the supply chain the portion of such audits that assessed compliance with the companys global policy on prison labor and summarizing levels of noncompliance detected evaluate any risks to finances operations and reputation related to prison labor in the costco supply chain including from undetected uses of noncompliant prison labor in the supply chain board of directors responsesince its inception our supplier code of conduct has prohibited prison labor that is unlawful in the country where it is performed in united states law concerning importation of goods made with convict labor or and forced labor or and indentured labor under penal sanction was strengthened with the elimination of an exception that had been broadly applied to allow such imports where domestically produced supply was not sufficient to meet domestic demand in early the company began a closer examination of the use of lawful prison labor in its supply chain this was a product of the changes in u s law and an awareness of greater concerns among some u s consumers after examining this issue more deeply we came to understand its complexity and the positions that have been articulated in favor of and in opposition to the use of even lawful prison labor supporters maintain that legal prison labor programs offer participants an opportunity that is more attractive than idle or other time spent in confinement opportunities for compensation and restitution and an opportunity for rehabilitation with the potential for employment after confinement those opposed to legal prison labor programs cite challenges in assuring that participation is truly voluntary the absence of private sector levels of compensation unsafe working conditions and other flaws some opponents also link the issue of legal prison labor to debates around the use of incarceration generally the company has not identified any consensus on the correct approach as part of enforcing its code of conduct costco conducts thousands of audits annually around the globe with qualified independent third parties in addition its buying and quality assurance staffs spend countless hours visiting production facilities as part of the process of bringing quality merchandise to our members through these efforts we have not seen significant levels of prison labor in our supply chain we have seldom seen it in the united states largely in the agricultural products segment where it is permitted by federal and state laws and even less internationally the company is committed under its code of conduct to protecting the working rights and safety of the people who produce process or harvest the merchandise it sells and appreciates that certain of its members might have particular concerns in this area in the company enacted its global policy on prison labor the policy allows costco suppliers to use legal prison labor if a the work is in compliance with the laws where the merchandise is manufactured b the person voluntarily consents to work under the offered terms and conditions including compensation c the persons gross wage paid is the same wage as non incarcerated workers for the same type of work in the same geographical area d third party audits are able to verify compliance with the above requirements e costcos code of conduct requirements apply in full to all persons regardless of their status and f the work is compliant with appropriate import and export laws all code of conduct audits conducted for costco are required to identify the use of any prison labor under the policy audits are to be conducted for compliance with the policy whenever prison labor is revealed thousands of code of conduct audits conducted since adoption of the policy last year have shown that the use of prison labor in our supply chain is extremely rare the rare circumstances where it has been revealed thus far show the following in five cases complete audits revealed full compliance with the policy costco is awaiting audit reports from three recent audits of two additional suppliers facilities in one case a prominent supplier reported wages associated with the use of prison labor to include benefits and other non monetary factors while we are reviewing it is likely that the company will require the supplier to cease business with the farm at issue in one case auditors were unable to gain access to prison records to confirm worker wages so we dropped the product one supplier has adjusted its supply chain to wholly eliminate prison labor from costcos supply chain the company believes that it has behaved diligently and responsibly concerning the identification and eradication of improper prison labor in its supply chain even though such labor represents only a tiny segment of that chain prison labor is but one of many areas that the company has to evaluate as part of its large and growing program for achieving compliance with its supplier code of conduct the company should be permitted to exercise discretion in how it conducts and reports on this program for the reasons set forth above the board of directors unanimously believes that this proposal is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders and recommends that you vote against it proxies solicited by the board of directors
