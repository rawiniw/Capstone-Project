the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees

of the fourteen directors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business academia government service and other public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every other year the assessment seeks to identity specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences formal nomination of candidates by shareholders requires compliance with section of the bylaws there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines corporate governance guidelines

the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately by mr brotman and mr sinegal the board believes that this structure which has its origins in the joint role of the two men in founding and driving the growth and success of the company has operated effectively for more than a decade in addition the board believes that it obtains effective additional board leadership through the role of the lead independent director currently filled by hamilton e james the role of the board in risk oversight one of the boards functions is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk risk is inherent in business and the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives risks vary in many ways including the ability of the company to anticipate and understand the risk the types of adverse impacts that could occur if the undesired event occurs the likelihood that an undesired event and a particular adverse impact would occur and the ability of the company to control the risk and the potential adverse impacts some risks may be identified and largely controlled and others are unknown some risks can be avoided or mitigated and some risks are unavoidable as a practical matter for some risks the potential adverse impact would be minor and as a matter of business judgment it may not be appropriate to allocate significant resources to avoid the impact in other cases the impact could be significant and it is prudent to expend resources to seek to avoid or mitigate a potential adverse impact in some cases a higher degree of risk may be acceptable because of a greater perceived potential for reward the company engages in a variety of activities seeking to align its voluntary risk taking with overall company objectives and understands that its projects and processes may enhance the companys business interests by encouraging appropriate levels of risk taking management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management briefing on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate the audit committee also oversees issues related to internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the ceo and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning and reviews succession plans each year the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs compensation of directors the following table summarizes information regarding director compensation for the non employee directors of

financial officer joseph p portera executive vice president coo eastern and canadian divisions and dennis r zook executive vice president coo southwest and mexico divisions compensation philosophy and objectives our compensation programs are designed to motivate all our executives and employees to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company believes it has been very successful in attracting and retaining quality employees achieving low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the companys compensation programs have historically contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes that it has been desirable to continue compensation programs that have been persistent features at the company for a number of years the compensation levels approved by the committee for the named executive officers for fiscal are not materially changed from those approved for the prior year the committee believes that the company performed well in light of the challenging economic conditions role of the compensation committee the committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of three members dr carson chair mr munger and ms ruckelshaus the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used consultants of any kind the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensation the components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation since fiscal consisting solely of rsus base salary a discretionary cash bonus program and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and modest perquisites the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has been to make equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not extensively reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages rsus rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation above others helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the short term with the performance conditions and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component payment of fixed cash compensation is consistent with the need for executive officers to have a predictable level of cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual adjustments with the exception of messrs sinegal and brotman whose salaries have remained at the same level since cash bonus discretionary cash bonuses are and have been a relatively small component of compensation they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements and perquisites consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has traditionally sought to have modest perquisites and other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k plan and the deferred compensation plan recognizing that the company does not have a traditional retirement plan and that no executive has any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing components of compensation combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent discretionary cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the vesting over five years of rsu awards and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation plan match the committee believes that the executive compensation programs do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by long term incentives including equity awards that vest over up to five years and share ownership guidelines which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests peer companies for fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation bjs wholesale club inc and lowes companies these companies were selected because they all are recognized as successful retailers and two of them represent the two other major membership warehouse operators in utilizing the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee does not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it has used them only for general reference equity compensation if fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers during fiscal the board of directors determined to replace all stock option awards with awards of rsus since fiscal all rsu grants to executive officers have been performance based these grants generally vest over five years contingent upon the executives maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation on the part of employees to improve the operations of the company over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that in the absence of accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to other officers and employees in fiscal was not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock prior to vesting recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested rsus beginning in fiscal all officers and employees who receive rsu grants are eligible for accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period interim vesting for long service can occur in the case of certain terminations for rsu grants prior to for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november the criteria were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or pretax income with both measures based on local currency for mr sinegal the criteria were a increase versus fiscal in total sales or pretax income with both measures based on local currency after the end of fiscal the committee determined that the sales goals were achieved accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee no such exception has been approved to date except to permit a grant to mr raikes in connection with his joining the board in all rsu awards in fiscal were made under the companys fifth restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders and the only equity plan maintained by the company other compensation the company provides the named executive officers with the benefits offered to all other employees in most respects the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that a certain percentage of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with certain perquisites including a car allowance the committee believes the benefits and perquisites are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these roles are critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr sinegal which was the same as his contract for the prior fiscal year the contract term was for the fiscal year unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with its terms but is renewable from year to year it provides for a base salary of it further provides for a cash bonus of up to determined by the board or the committee and a rsu award determined by the board or the committee the company has the right to terminate mr sinegal for cause and he has the right to terminate the agreement on days notice mr brotman who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee has with the agreement of messrs brotman and sinegal treated them similarly for compensation purposes owing to the similarities in their historical and current contributions to the success of the company apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees neither mr brotman nor mr sinegal has any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to each of messrs brotman and sinegal the same number granted for the prior fiscal year mr sinegal did not request any change in the size of the award versus the prior year and the committee did not otherwise believe a change was warranted the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base salaries of messrs brotman and sinegal have been since fiscal cash bonuses have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal messrs brotman and sinegal each were awarded cash bonuses of in fiscal there are no fixed criteria applied by the committee in considering the amount of these bonuses generally mr sinegal recommends to the committee the bonus he believes is appropriate historically he has recommended modest amounts seeking to link his bonus as a percentage of that eligible amount stated in his employment contract to bonuses earned by employees generally eligible for the bonuses this year the company attained its internal net income goal and employees were eligible to receive the bonus award component associated with this goal essentially of the eligible bonus amount mr sinegal recommended to the committee bonus amounts for other executive officers that were approximately of eligible amounts inclusive of the net income goal he requested a bonus for himself in the same proportion accordingly mr sinegal requested a bonus of of the eligible amount in his employment agreement the committee approved this request and approved an equal award for mr brotman the committee observed that cash bonuses paid to chief executive officers at some peer companies are substantially higher the committee however wishes to respect mr sinegals desire to receive modest compensation in part because it believes that higher amounts would not change mr sinegals motivation and performance the committee has indicated in the past and continues to believe that messrs brotman and sinegal are underpaid the committee has also noted that messrs brotman and sinegal have for many years had direct and indirect economic interests in shareholdings of the company which further align their interests with the companys shareholders compensation of other named executive officers as noted above the most significant component of the compensation of the named executive officers is the award in fiscal of performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs dicerchio galanti jelinek portera and zook were and respectively the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr sinegal and were the same amounts as awarded in fiscal as noted above the performance criteria were attained and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as described above salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr sinegal who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level salary levels increased up to over fiscal bonus the named executive officers other than messrs brotman and sinegal received discretionary cash bonuses ranging from approximately to approximately increased from the prior year bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr sinegal after the close of the fiscal year mr sinegal recommended bonus amounts to the committee of of potential amounts the committee maintains the discretion to vary from mr sinegals recommendation but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year as with all other employees roughly of the bonus potential was achieved due to the companys attainment of its internal net income target for fiscal eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the companys net income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibilities for each officer there is also a component not linked to any objective measure mr sinegal is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he can and does consider what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november following the fiscal year for which the amounts are paid stock ownership guidelines in fiscal the company adopted stock ownership requirements for executive officers by january all executive officers were required to own and maintain at least shares of common stock all executive officers are in compliance with this requirement impact of tax considerations the committee examined the equity compensation in light of the impact of section m of the internal revenue code which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of million in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation i e compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders rsus and stock options granted to our named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception in approving compensation types and levels the committee considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes it retains the ability to approve what it believes to be appropriate compensation even if the company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws conclusion the committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to its shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee of the companys board of directors has submitted the following report for inclusion in this proxy statement the committee has reviewed and discussed with

company this year is providing shareholders with an advisory vote on whether the advisory vote on executive compensation should be held every one two or three years the board believes that a frequency

compensation during the interval between say on pay votes are welcome to bring their specific concerns to the attention of the board please refer to shareholder communications to the board in this proxy statement for information about communicating with the board the proxy card provides shareholders with the opportunity to choose among four options holding the vote every one two or three years
