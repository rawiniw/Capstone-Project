in scope of rule p it believes that it has interpreted contract to manufacture broadly for purposes of this filing costcos objective is that our sourcing practices not support armed conflict or human rights abuses in the democratic republic of congo and surrounding areas to aid in identifying suppliers to include in its rcoi costco provided a third party service source intelligence si with descriptive information for nonfood products that costco sold during including whether or not costco may have manufactured or contracted to manufacture those products si reviewed the product data using automated queries and a detailed quality control check to determine which of those products might contain tg if si had doubt regarding the use of tg in products the suppliers of the products were initially included in the rcoi process the products si initially flagged as in scope due to potential presence of tg were those that are electronic or electrical solar powered contained any kind of metal e g metal covering including alloys or metal hardware or had unclear material content the companys scoping inquiry included nonfood products sold in the united states canada mexico united kingdom japan korea taiwan australia iceland france and spain next tier suppliers were asked questions to confirm whether the products they supplied to costco contain tg that are necessary to the functionality or production of the product and whether costco contracted with the supplier to manufacture the product or costco influenced the manufacturing and whether the products were supplied to costco during the reporting year this information was used to determine which of our suppliers were in scope for rcois if in scope si asked the suppliers to provide additional conflict minerals information suppliers were then engaged to collect information regarding the presence and sourcing of tg used in items sold to costco si provided costco with lists of suppliers classified as out of scope for review and suppliers were re engaged as needed if requested by costco based on additional information about the products they supply and the nature of the relationship with costco by
