attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan as required under u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits present the fair value of the fully benefit responsive investment contracts with a corresponding adjustment to reflect these investments at contract value the statements of changes in net assets available for benefits are prepared on a contract value basis b use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions c investment valuation and income recognitionthe plan invests in the companys common stock and other exchange traded equity securities as well as various registered investment companies and certain benefit responsive investment contracts that in turn invest in a combination of stocks bonds and other investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is possible that changes in the

company the issuer legally owns the assets underlying the sac and is required to segregate them into a separate account which is designed to be protected from the claims of the issuers general creditors in the event of issuer insolvency the issuer of the wrap contract provides for unscheduled withdrawals from the contract at contract value regardless of the value of the underlying assets in order to fund routine permitted participant initiated withdrawals there are no reserves against contract value for credit risk of the contract issuer or otherwise the crediting interest rate is based on a formula agreed upon with the issuer but it may not be less than zero such interest rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for resetting certain events limit the ability of the plan to transact

the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs the three levels of inputs are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data table of contentscostco k retirement plannotes to financial statementsdecember and the following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value level primarily consists of financial instruments such as investments in registered investment company funds and costco common stock whose value is based on quoted market prices such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market exchangetraded instruments and listed equities level includes assets and liabilities where quoted market prices are unobservable but observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities valuation methodologies are based on consensus pricing using market prices from a variety of industrystandard data providers or pricing that considers various assumptions including time value yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures all are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for which the plan typically receives independent external valuation information level assets include significant unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants the plan uses the income approach for certain investments which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies or replacement cost for level assets valuation techniques utilized during the reporting period in the fair value measurement of level and level assets and liabilities presented on the plans statements of net assets available for benefits were not changed from previous practice there were no level assets or liabilities on
