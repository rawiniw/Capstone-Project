descriptive information for nonfood products that costco sells including whether or not it manufactures or contracts to manufacture those products si reviewed the product data using automated queries and a detailed quality control check to determine which products that we may contract to manufacture might contain tg if si had doubt regarding the use of tg in products the suppliers of the products were initially included in the rcoi process the products si initially flagged as in scope due to potential presence of tg were those that are electronic or electrical solar powered contained any kind of metal e g metal covering including alloys or metal hardware or had unclear material content the companys scoping inquiry included nonfood products sold in the united states canada mexico united kingdom japan korea australia and spain suppliers were asked questions to confirm whether the products they supply to costco contain tg that are necessary to the functionality or production of the product and whether costco contracted with the supplier to manufacture the product or costco influenced the manufacturing si used this information to determine which of our suppliers were in scope for rcois if in scope si asked the applicable suppliers to provide additional conflict minerals information suppliers were then engaged to collect information regarding the presence and sourcing of tg used in items sold to costco we utilized the conflict free sourcing initiative cfsi conflict minerals reporting template cmrt information was collected and stored using an online platform provided by

platform information requestedrecognizing that the information requested can take time to collect and aggregate suppliers were given a final deadline of april to provide information about the mineral processors in their supply chains for the reporting year suppliers were asked to provide information regarding the sourcing of their conflict minerals with the ultimate goal of identifying the tg smelters or refiners sors and the country of origin of the conflict minerals suppliers who had already performed an rcoi through the use of the cmrt were asked to upload this document into the si system or to provide this information in the online survey version suppliers had the ability to share information at a level with which they were most comfortable i e company product or user defined but the scope of the declaration had to be specific quality assurancesupplier responses were evaluated for plausibility consistency and completeness additional supplier contacts were conducted to

indicated that it had not received conflict minerals data for each metal from all suppliers supplier indicated it had not identified all of the sors used for the products included in the declaration scope supplier indicated it had not provided all applicable sor information and a smelter or refiner sor is any company that procures and processes mineral ore slag or materials from recycled or scrap sources into refined metal or metal containing intermediate products the output can be pure or greater metals powders ingots bars grains oxides or salts si maintains a smelter refiner database to document companies that are verified metal which companies are exclusive recyclers mine country of origin information and drc conflict free certification status si collects sor data submitted by
