global securities that will be deposited with or on behalf of a depositary located in the united states a u s depositary or a common depositary located outside the united states a common depositary identified in the prospectus supplement relating to the series global securities will be issued in registered form in either temporary or definitive form the specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any debt securities of a series will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the series we anticipate that the following provisions will apply to all depositary arrangements with a u s depositary or common depositary book entry securities unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement debt securities which are to be represented by a global security to be deposited with or on behalf of a u s depositary will be represented by a global security registered in the name of the depositary or its nominee upon the issuance of a global security in registered form the u s depositary for the global security will credit on its book entry registration and transfer system the respective principal amounts of the debt securities represented by the global security to the accounts of institutions that have accounts with the depositary or its nominee participants the accounts to be credited shall be designated by the underwriters or agents of the debt securities or by us if the debt securities are offered and sold directly by us ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities will be shown on and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through records maintained by the u s depositary or its nominee for the global security or by participants or persons that hold through participants the laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in definitive form these limits and laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security so long as the u s depositary for a global security in registered form or its nominee is the registered owner of the global security the depositary or nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner or holder of the debt securities represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture governing the debt securities except as set forth below owners of beneficial interests in these global securities will not be entitled to have debt securities of the series represented by the global security registered in their names will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities

registered in the name of or held by a u s depositary or its nominee will be made to the u s depositary or its nominee as the case may be as the registered owner or the holder of the global security representing the debt securities neither we nor any trustee or paying agent nor the security registrar for the debt securities will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a global security for the debt securities or for maintaining supervising or reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership interests we expect that the u s depositary for debt securities of a series upon receipt of any payment of principal of and premium if any or interest on permanent global securities will credit participants accounts on the date the payment is payable in accordance with their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global securities as shown on the records of the depositary we also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through the participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in street name and will be the responsibility of the participants unless and until it is exchanged in whole for debt securities in definitive form a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the u s depositary for the global security to a nominee of the depositary or by a nominee of the depositary to the depositary or another nominee of the depositary or by the depositary or any nominee to a successor of the depositary or a nominee of the successor if a u s depositary for debt securities in registered form is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within days we will issue debt securities in definitive registered form in exchange for the global security or global securities representing the debt securities in addition we may at any time and in our sole discretion determine not to have any debt securities in registered form represented by one or more global securities and in such event will issue debt securities in definitive registered form in exchange for the global security or global securities representing the debt securities in this instance an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of debt securities of the series represented by the global security equal in principal amount to the beneficial interest and to have the debt securities registered in the name of the owner of the beneficial interest table of contents absence of restrictive covenants we are not restricted by the indenture from paying dividends or from incurring assuming or becoming liable for any type of debt or other

exercise of our option to discharge our obligations under the indenture with respect to the series and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and discharge had not occurred or b an opinion of tax counsel to the same effect as the ruling described in clause a above and based upon a change in
