estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all u s merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in first out fifo method the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues the company records an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated annual effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end when actual inflation rates and inventory levels have been determined due to inflation the merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of in the third quarter of and in the first thirty six weeks of at fiscal year end merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle derivatives the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business the company manages these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to u s dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made primarily by consolidated subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the u s dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting the company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions the aggregate notional amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts were and at may and august respectively these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features the company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the company has an established banking relationship there can table of contents be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk the contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note for information on the fair value of open unsettled forward

transaction gains and losses were inconsequential for the third quarter and first thirty six weeks ended may and may respectively the company is exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes particularly electricity and natural gas which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately of its warehouses and other facilities primarily in the u s and canada the company also enters into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas in addition to fuel for its gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet

value of financial instruments the company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements relating to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities including presentation of

participants at the measurement date the guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs that may be used are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data

that defendants caused the company to falsely represent that options were granted with exercise prices that were not less than the fair market value of the companys stock on the date of grant and issuance when they were not to conceal that its internal controls and accounting controls were grossly inadequate and to grossly overstate its earnings in addition it was further alleged that when the company announced in october that it had investigated its historical option granting practices and had not found fraud that announcement itself was false and misleading because among other reasons it failed to report that defendants had consistently received options granted at monthly lows for the grant dates and falsely suggested that backdating did not occur plaintiff also alleged that false and

other risks identified from time to time in the companys public statements and reports filed with the sec this management discussion should be read in conjunction with the management discussion included in our fiscal annual report on form k previously filed with the sec overview we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover this turnover when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills self service warehouse facilities enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers mass merchandisers supermarkets and supercenters we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including other warehouse clubs discount department drug variety and specialty stores and supermarkets as well as internet retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authorityconsistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members negatively impacting gross margin table of contents item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dollars in millions except per share and warehouse number data we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth however the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouse when openings occur in existing markets are ameliorated our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income key items for the third quarter of fiscal as compared to the third quarter of

fiscal quarters ended may and may respectively references to the first thirty six weeks of and relate to the weeks ended may and may respectively use of estimates the preparation of financial

merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all u s merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in first out fifo method the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues the company records an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated annual effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end when inflation rates and inventory levels are finalized during the third quarter and first thirty six weeks of due to inflation u s merchandise inventories valued at lifo were lower than the fifo value resulting in a and charge to merchandise costs respectively at fiscal year end merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle derivatives the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business the company manages these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to u s dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made primarily by consolidated subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the u s dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting the company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions the aggregate notional amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts were and at may and august respectively these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features the company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which the company has an established banking relationship there can be no assurance however that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk the contracts are limited to less than one year in duration see note for information on the fair value of open unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of may and august the following table summarizes the amount of net foreign currency transaction unrealized gain or loss recognized in interest income and other net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income relating to forward foreign exchange contracts weeks ended weeks ended may may may may forward foreign exchange contracts gains and losses recognized in the table above are largely offset by the impact of translating foreign currency denominated payables which are also recognized in interest income and other net these foreign currency translation gains and losses were inconsequential for the third quarter and first thirty six weeks ended may and may respectively the company is exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for the energy it consumes particularly electricity and natural gas which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately of its warehouses and other facilities primarily in the u s and canada the company also enters into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas in addition to fuel for its gas stations on an index basis these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment fair value of financial instruments the company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements relating to financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities including presentation of required disclosures this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs that may be used are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data there have been no material changes to the valuation techniques utilized in the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities as disclosed in the company s form k for

party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business the company manages these fluctuations in part through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to u s dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made primarily by consolidated subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the u s dollar currently these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting the company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions the aggregate notional amounts of forward foreign exchange contracts were and at may and august respectively these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features the company seeks to manage counterparty risk associated with these

disclosures this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs that may be used are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant
