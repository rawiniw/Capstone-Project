equity securities as well as various registered investment companies and certain benefit responsive investment contracts that in turn invest in a combination of stocks bonds and other investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it

any accrued but unpaid interest e distribution of benefitsdistributions of benefits are recorded when paid fair value measurementu s gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs the three levels of inputs are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data the following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value level primarily consists of financial instruments such as investments in registered investment company funds and costco common stock whose value is based on quoted market prices such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market exchange traded instruments and listed equities level includes assets and liabilities where quoted market prices are unobservable but observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities valuation methodologies are based on consensus pricing using market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers or pricing that considers various assumptions including time value yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures all are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for which the plan typically receives independent external valuation information level assets include significant unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants the plan uses the income approach for certain investments which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies or replacement cost for level assets valuation techniques utilized during the reporting period in the fair value measurement of level level and level assets and liabilities presented on the plans statements of net assets available for benefits were not changed from previous practice the company reports transfers in and out of levels and as applicable using the fair value of the individual securities or funds as of the beginning
