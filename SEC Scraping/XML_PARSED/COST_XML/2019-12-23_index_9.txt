distribution facilities leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the company can exercise at the end of the initial term a renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement b purchase the property at the then fair market value or c a right of first refusal in the event of a third party offer some leases include free rent periods and step rent provisions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the company more likely than not expects to exercise from the date the company has control of the property certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants the company determines at inception of a contract whether the contract is or contains a lease the company initially records right of use rou assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term as the rate implicit in the companys leases is not easily determinable the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the companys incremental borrowing rate the rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term the company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate the lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the option recent accounting pronouncements adoptedin february the fasb issued asu leases asc which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than months the company adopted asc using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of september as the date

these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins net sales less merchandise costs than most other retailers we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions and sales related to e commerce websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our u s and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative sga expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business including the effects of inflation or deflation especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global table of contentsnational and regional wholesalers and retailers including those with e commerce operations while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items and through online offerings our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority on quality goods consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non gasoline business it also has lower sga expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non gasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near term net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our sga expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect additionally actions in various countries particularly china and the united states have created uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other things the type of goods rates imposed and timing of the tariffs the impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases while these potential impacts are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our results we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our e commerce business growth domestically and internationally has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business the membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area some significant costs are partially outside our control particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business operates on very low margins modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income table of contentsour operating model is generally the same across our u s canada and other international operating segments see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i item of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales and or less or no direct membership warehouse competition in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar which are references to the differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreign exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in

contain one or more of the following options which the company can exercise at the end of the initial term a renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement b purchase the property at the then fair market value or c a right of first refusal in the event of a third party offer some leases include free rent periods and step rent provisions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the company more likely than not expects to exercise from the date the company has control of the property certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants the company determines at inception of a contract whether the contract is or contains a lease the company initially records right of use rou assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term as the rate implicit in the companys leases is not easily determinable the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the companys incremental borrowing rate the rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term the company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate the lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the option recent accounting pronouncements adopted recent accounting pronouncements adoptedin february the fasb issued asu leases asc which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and

endednovember andnovember respectively use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions leases the company leases land and or buildings at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the company can exercise at the end of the initial term a renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement b purchase the property at the then fair market value or c a right of first refusal in the event of a third party offer some leases include free rent periods and step rent provisions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the company more likely than not expects to exercise from the date the company has control of the property certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants the company determines at inception of a contract whether the contract is or contains a lease the company initially records right of use rou assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term as the rate implicit in the companys leases is not easily determinable the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated by using the companys incremental borrowing rate the rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term the company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate the lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the option recent accounting pronouncements adoptedin february the fasb issued asu leases asc which required recognition on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases with terms greater than months the company adopted asc using the modified retrospective transition method and elected to use the effective date of september as the date of initial application consequently the comparative periods presented continue to be in accordance with asc leases the company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance allowing the company to carry forward conclusions related to a whether expired or existing contracts contain leases b lease classification and c initial direct costs for existing leases the company has elected not to record operating lease right of use assets or lease liabilities associated with leases with durations of months or less lastly the company elected the practical expedient allowing aggregation of non lease components with related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment for all classes of underlying assets adoption of the new standard resulted in an initial increase to assets and liabilities of related to recognition of operating lease right of use assets and operating lease obligations as of september other line item impacts in the company s
