of any changes on your earnings further please discuss in reasonable detail economic or industry wide factors relevant to your company material opportunities challenges and risk in the short and long term and actions you are taking to address them refer to item of regulation s k and sec release no response we acknowledge the importance of providing meaningful item mda overview disclosures in our annual and quarterly reports including a discussion of material trends and uncertainties as well as economic or industry wide factors relevant to our company and material opportunities challenges and risks and actions we are taking to address them in our future form q and k filings we will expand our disclosure to further address these items for example subject to potential intervening changes in the business we will include disclosure in substantially the following form in the mda overview section of our next form q filing proposed disclosure new text underlined we believe that the most important driver of increasing profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth comparable sales growth is achieved through a combination of increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations the higher our comparable sales not associated with currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe the company has repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states adverse economic conditions negatively impacted spending by our customers during and we expect that negative impact to continue in sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including other warehouse clubs discount department drug variety and specialty stores and supermarkets as well as internet retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values this may cause us for example at certain times to absorb increases in merchandise costs rather than immediately passing them along to our members our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income we also achieve growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger facilities as our warehouse base grows and available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth but the negative aspects of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouse when openings occur in existing markets are ameliorated our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue with respect to our net income discussion in part ii item page of our form k our discussion in this section itself focused on the more significant unusual items that accounted for the decrease in net income compared to the prior year the remaining per diluted share decrease is the result of a combination of other factors such as sales membership fees gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses that are discussed in detail in the preceding sections of the mda disclosure in future filings we will expand our net income disclosure to clarify these points and when applicable provide additional analysis to assist investors in ascertaining the likelihood or extent past performance is indicative of future performance using the net income disclosure from the form k p as an example we would revise the disclosure as follows new text underlined h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february net income vs net income for decreased to or per diluted share from or per diluted share during representing a decrease in diluted net income per share as previously discussed foreign currencies particularly in canada the united kingdom and korea weakened against the u s dollar which negatively impacted net income for by approximately after tax or per diluted share additionally net income for was negatively impacted by a pre tax charge or approximately per diluted share related to a proposed litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy as well as a pre tax charge or approximately per diluted share for an adjustment to the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts other factors discussed in detail above including sales membership fees gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses contributed to the decrease in net income most particularly the decline in sales a substantial decline in share repurchase activity also impacted the decline in earnings per share net income for was positively impacted by a pre tax or per diluted share benefit due to the reversal of the lifo reserve established in notes to consolidated financial statements page note summary of significant accounting policies property and equipment page we note the estimated useful lives of your buildings ranges from years in this regard explain to us the reason for such a wide range in addition clarify the nature of the building structures that fall within the low end of the h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february range and explain to us why their estimated useful lives are reasonable response in general we assign estimated useful lives to our building assets using a componentization method rather than assigning a single life to the building as a whole each building has approximately different asset categories such as flooring restrooms roofing masonry external metal building structure hvac systems and parking lot assets each category is assigned a useful life based on the shorter of the estimated useful life of that category or the remaining lease term those categories assigned a useful life of five years generally include carpeting and flooring other than the concrete slab which are replaced more frequently and which generally represent a very small percentage of the total value of the building and improvements proposed disclosure new text underlined property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost in general new building additions are separated into components each with its own estimated useful life depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight line method interest costs incurred on property during the construction period are capitalized estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows years buildings equipment and fixtures leasehold improvements shorter of useful life or lease term land improvements software acquisition and development h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february revenue recognition page we note you offer free technical support services and extended warranties on electronic products in this regard tell us and disclose how you account for these separate deliverables refer to eitf and fasb asc also advise us whether you offer similar extended warranties for other products such as tires and batteries etc if so tell us and disclose your accounting policy for each of these programs in your response tell us and disclose whether you are the primary obligor and how you recognize the revenues and the related costs to the extent that you are the primary obligor and that these programs are material to your financial statements we believe you should disclose how you estimate the warranty obligations including the key assumptions behind the estimates in your critical accounting policies section mda refer to sec release no response the free technical support services are primarily phone assistance related to product set up and use and are performed by a third party service provider we do not view this service as a separate unit of accounting under eitf fasb asc primarily because the amount of separate revenue that one might theoretically separate for this item is insignificant total costs were approximately million in fiscal these costs are expensed as incurred and included in merchandise costs in our consolidated statements of income which totaled over billion in fiscal unlike many retailers the company does not separately sell extended warranties on merchandise it carries costco provides a twelve month warranty following the typical manufacturers twelve month warranty the costs related to costcos warranty are accrued at the time of sale as a warranty obligation under fas accounting for contingencies fasb asc and we view these costs as an obligation incurred in connection with the sale of certain electronics items that may require further performance the warranty repair work is performed by h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february third party service providers the accrual is based on our historical experience related to the number of repair incidents and the average repair cost the estimated warranty cost has averaged approximately million annually over the last two years the warranty accrual at the end of fiscal was approximately million the above items were not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements due to their immateriality we do not offer a similar warranty program for the vast majority of items that we sell based upon the companys policy of member satisfaction however we generally accept returns of merchandise we have a day returns policy on certain electronics items our battery and tire warranties relate to the age of the item upon a return batteries are generally sold with a one to three year life meaning that any battery returned within the related time frame warranty period will receive a full refund while batteries returned after the warranty period will receive a pro rated return value in relation to its stated life tires are sold with a road hazard warranty which will refund the member a pro rated value based on tread usage and or months used assuming the member meets the conditions of the warranty these adjustments concerning batteries and tires are included in the sales returns reserve taken at the time of sale we note your policy of recognizing membership fees ratably over the one year membership period however we also noted from your company website that it is your policy to refund membership fees in full at any time in this regard expand your disclosures to clarify your cancellation and refund policy for membership fees in addition explain to us why it is appropriate under gaap to recognize membership fees ratably over the membership period given the full refund policy refer to sab topic a response it is our policy to refund membership fees in full upon request we believe it is appropriate under sab topic a to recognize membership fees ratably over the h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february membership period as the criteria specified under that topic are all met the estimate of cancellations and refunds are made for a large pool of homogeneous items i e one year memberships reliable estimates of cancellations and refunds can be made on a timely basis there is sufficient specific historical basis upon which to estimate the refunds and we believe that such historical experience is predictive of future events and the amount of the membership fees is fixed at the outset of the arrangement we also note that membership refunds historically have averaged only approximately of membership income in the interest of providing additional clarity for investors however we intend to include disclosure in substantially the following form in describing our policy concerning recognition of membership fees new text underlined membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the companys members the company accounts for membership fee revenue net of estimated refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period we note you partnered with american express in offering the co branded costco true earnings cash rebate card for purchases made at costco and elsewhere in this regard tell us and disclose the nature of your business relationship or agreement if any with american express and your accounting for the arrangement response we have an agreement with the american express company amex to provide co branded consumer and small business card products costco and amex have agreed to a basic merchant fee on transactions to issue co branded cards to joint promotional efforts and to various other pay for performance incentives h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february we account for this contract following the guidance in eitf accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor asc which established criteria to determine the proper presentation and recognition of consideration received from a vendor after considering this criteria certain rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income offsetting specific incremental expenses incurred by the company and others are accounted for as revenue and included in net sales in those statements the cash rebate earned by our members from use of the co branded trueearnings card is paid by amex we accept the rebate certificates as a form of payment from our members and receive reimbursement from amex for certificates redeemed note leases page we note you classified a majority of your leases as operating leases and that their lease terms would expire through please explain to us how you determined that their classification as operating leases were appropriate in light of the long lease terms reference is made to paragraph of sfas and fasb asc response we determine the classification of leases at inception following the criteria of paragraph of sfas fasb asc at the end of fiscal we operated locations world wide of which were leased of these leased locations were land only leases costco leases the land but owns the building leaving only locations where both the land and building were leased in the case of a land only lease we follow the criteria of paragraph of sfas fasb asc which states that if land is the sole item of property leased and there is either a bargain purchase option or transfer of ownership the lease is classified as a capital lease otherwise an operating lease h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february your question specifically referenced leases with a longer term our leases that have a longer term in general are land only leases and do not contain either a bargain purchase option or result in the transfer of ownership therefore the classification as operating leases is appropriate exhibit certifications please ensure that your certifications appear exactly as set forth in item b of regulation s k for example we note that you added annual to paragraphs two and three and deleted parenthetical phrases from paragraphs d and response the company will ensure that our certifications appear exactly as set forth in item b of regulation s k in our future filings definitive proxy statement on schedule a compensation discussion and analysis page please expand your compensation discussion to address the requirements of item b of regulation s k for example you should discuss the objectives of your compensation program what your compensation program is designed to reward why you choose to pay each element of your plan and how each element of compensation fits into your overall compensation plan h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february response we believe that the compensation discussion and analysis taken as a whole substantially covered these issues nevertheless in future disclosures to the extent consistent with programs as they exist at the time of filing we will consolidate and supplement this discussion and analysis to further clarify i the objectives of the compensation program ii what the compensation program is designed to reward iii why we choose to pay each element of the program and iv how each element of compensation fits into our overall compensation plan i objectives of the compensation program we have described the objectives of the compensation program in different portions of the cda along with the achievements of the program such as historic contributions to the financial and competitive success of the company that we also consider objectives for example on page of the proxy statement under compensation philosophy and objectives we described the objectives of the program our compensation programs are designed to motivate all our executives and employees to continue to feel part of the company and to participate in the growth of our business historically the company believes it has been very successful in attracting and retaining quality employees achieving low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the companys compensation programs have historically contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes that it has been desirable to continue compensation programs that have been persistent features at the company for a number of years on page of the proxy statement we described the objectives of the performance based rsu program the board of directors approved the switch to rsu awards because it believed that the awards aligned the interests of employee grantees and shareholders in addition it is believed that the five year vesting h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february requirement helps to foster motivation on the part of employees to improve the operations of the company over the longer term also on page of the proxy statement we further described the objectives of the compensation program the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to its stockholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team ii what the compensation program is designed to reward to further describe what the compensation program is designed to reward we will to the extent consistent with programs as they exist at the time of future filings provide additional analysis along the following lines in addition to current cash compensation and perquisites these features combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus for executive officers being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent discretionary cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the vesting over five years of rsu awards share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans deferred compensation the rsus are the dominant feature of compensation which the committee believes is a key element for attaining alignment between the interests of executives and the interests of the company and its shareholders particularly sustained appreciation in the price of common stock iii why we choose to pay each element of compensation we believe the analysis of why we choose to pay each h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february element of compensation is adequately described under element of compensation on page of the proxy statement the following discussion generally applies to compensation for all named executive officers based largely on historical practices of the company the components of our compensation programs are base salary a discretionary cash bonus program equity compensation since the fourth quarter of fiscal consisting solely of awards of rsus and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and perquisites executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group and the company places great emphasis in the compensation packages for the named executive officers on equity incentive compensation the committee did not extensively reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages iv how each element of compensation fits into our overall compensation plan we believe that the analysis of how each element of compensation fits into our overall compensation plan is adequately described in the excerpt from page of the proxy statement described above we note your discussion on page regarding discretionary cash bonuses paid to your named executive officers other than messrs brotman and sinegal you state that roughly of the bonus potential was not achieved due to the companys failure to attain its internal net income target and that eligibility for the remainder of the cash bonus was based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility it does not appear that you provided a quantitative discussion of the terms of these targets and goals if you omitted this information because you believe it would result in competitive harm please tell us your reasons please also discuss how h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february difficult it will be going forward to achieve the target and goal levels or other factors please refer to instruction to item b of regulation s k and compliance and disclosure interpretation regulation s k question available on our website at http www sec gov divisions corpfin cfguidance shtml response the company believes that disclosure of the terms of the specified targets and goals associated with the discretionary cash bonus program for named executive officers other than messrs brotman and sinegal is not required under item b and instruction to item b of regulation s k or the guidance in compliance and disclosure interpretation regulation s k question because the specified performance levels are not material either in the context of the companys executive compensation policies or decisions or otherwise as detailed below no single performance goal of the multiple goals that inform the bonus program over separate metrics among the five named executive officers who participate in the program is material to an understanding of the companys compensation policies or decisions i understand that an omitted fact is generally considered to be material for purposes of the federal securities laws if there is a substantial likelihood that a instruction to item b of regulation s k states that the purpose of cda is to provide investors material information that is necessary to an understanding of the registrants compensation policies regarding the named executive officers emphasis added instruction to item b of regulation s k requires disclosure of current or future years performance targets to the extent that the targets are material to an understanding of named executive officer compensation for the last fiscal year emphasis added similarly the answer to question of the staffs compliance disclosure interpretations of regulation s k states that a company should begin its analysis of whether it is required to disclose performance targets by addressing the threshold question of materiality in the context of the companys executive compensation policies or decisions if performance targets are not material in this context the company is not required to disclose the performance targets emphasis added h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february reasonable shareholder would consider it important tsc indus inc v northway inc u s securities exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no i note that in my experience securities analysts and shareholders have not requested disclosure of the target levels of performance established in connection with the companys annual bonus program i also understand that an omitted fact is moreover generally considered to be material only if there was a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available basic inc v levinson u s quoting tsc indus u s at thus the multiple targets for the cash bonus program must be viewed in the context of the companys executive compensation policies and decisions the types and amounts of compensation received by the executive officers in question and the discretionary aspects of the bonus program the company does not view cash bonuses as a significant part of its overall executive compensation program the proxy statement on page states that the executive compensation program emphasizes equity compensation in view of relatively low salaries and cash bonuses compared to its peer companies accordingly the amount of the cash bonuses is small relative to total cash compensation and total compensation there are five executive officers covered in the compensation tables for whom the metrics in question are directly pertinent using total compensation values from the summary compensation table for fiscal the percentages of bonus paid to total compensation were dicerchio galanti jelinek portera and zook year over year changes in the total amount of cash bonuses have also been small for the three years reflected in the table the greatest difference between the highest and lowest amounts awarded to an individual officer the absolute amount of the bonuses could be larger in a year when the company also achieves the income target but it is likely that achieving that target would occur in the context of increased equity values but even a doubling of these percentages would not indicate that the bonuses represent a material portion of total compensation h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february is less than and in most cases the difference is significantly less even if the total bonus amounts could be deemed material none of the individual subcomponents that inform the amount of the cash bonuses is material because no single metric would account for more than half of the bonus potential and most account for only around as disclosed on page of the proxy statement the cash bonus amounts are a function of at least five different categories of metrics in addition to an internal income target which accounts for roughly of the bonus potential the bonus for fiscal year was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibilities in addition to the small portion each individual subcomponent plays in the overall bonus program the lower value metrics are not uniform across the entire population of executive officers covered by the tables thus requiring disclosure of all the quantitative metrics would give shareholders clutter rather than clarity the company half half that is if the maximum amount of the component is awarded of the bonus is based upon a company income target which alone among the metrics is the same for all the officers in question beyond that there is a great variation among the metrics applied for two primary reasons for those with responsibilities across the entire company geographically dicerchio galanti and jelinek metrics are company wide for those with geographically focused responsibilities the metrics are regionally based portera based on one data set for canada and another for h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february the eastern united states and zook based on a data set for part of the united states in addition some officers are governed primarily by operational metrics while the remainder have metrics that are department focused and there is a solely qualitative element of the bonus for each executive that has no associated metrics thus apart from the company income target and the non quantitative component there are a more than twenty different metrics that can influence the cash bonuses for these five officers the most significant of which accounted for no more than in fiscal clearly no one of these can be deemed material to an investors understanding of the companys compensation policies and decisions further evidence of the immateriality of any individual metric of the cash bonus plan is the discretionary nature of the program as noted on page of the proxy statement the cash bonus payments are discretionary and are reported as such in the bonus column of the summary compensation table the discretion exists at two levels mr sinegal the ceo makes the initial determination as to the amount of the cash bonuses he wishes to recommend to the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee maintains discretion to vary from mr sinegals recommendation although it rarely exercises that discretion mr sinegal determines the recommended amount of the cash bonuses after a discretionary and subjective evaluation of company and executive officer performance in specified areas identified at the beginning of the fiscal year he is not bound to recommend the payment any specific amount based on achievement of any pre established formulas for example as noted there was an income target in fiscal that was not met mr sinegal nevertheless had the discretion to recommend to the compensation committee the full amount of the potential cash bonus associated with this target known as the company half to award some fraction not necessarily in proportionate fashion or none at all he chose in this particular year to award none at all in addition as noted above a substantial component of the cash bonuses lacks any quantitative framework based on the foregoing we believe that it is appropriate for the company to refrain from including the specified h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission february targets for each of the different metrics that comprise the bonus program form q for the quarterly period ended november please
