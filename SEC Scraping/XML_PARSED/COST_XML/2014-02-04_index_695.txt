january the letter please see the discussion below which corresponds to the numbered paragraphs in your letter form k for the fiscal year ended september results of operations page membership fees page tell us what consideration you gave to disclosing your member renewal rates by class of membership and discussing the fees from executive memberships with the related amount of executive reward incurred in mda in this regard tell us why you offset executive reward rebates with sales as opposed to membership fees if you dont believe such an analysis of membership fees would be useful to your investors please explain in detail given that membership fees fluctuations flow directly to pre tax net income please also ensure you discuss membership fee revenue changes between fee increases and changes in the volume of memberships lastly explain to us how you calculate your membership renewal rates in this regard we read your disclosure on page which states t he renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date explain to us why the renewals are being captured over a period of up to eighteen months prior to the reporting date an example illustrating the calculation may be beneficial to our understanding response our membership renewal rates are not materially different between our two types of memberships goldstar and business which include executive upgrades our worldwide renewal rate of as disclosed in our form k was comprised of business and goldstar renewal rates of and respectively therefore we do not believe it would be meaningful to investors to disclose them separately we evaluate the executive reward program program based upon the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic revenue recognition multiple element arrangements it states that arrangement consideration shall be allocated among the separate units of accounting we have concluded that the program represents an arrangement that includes the right to earn a reward up to an annual maximum reward amount from making qualifying purchases at costco the amounts earned under the program by costco executive members making qualifying purchases are not based on the annual executive membership fee the reward that can be earned can be many multiples of the underlying annual membership fee although the executive membership gives the member the opportunityto earn a reward under the program the reward itself is only earned james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionfebruary if the member makes qualifying purchases at costco furthermore the executive membership does not need to be renewed in order to redeem any rewards previously earned under the program we have therefore concluded that the separate units of accounting inherent in the program include the initial qualifying merchandise purchase generating a reward deemed to be the delivered item and the earned reward the undelivered item the consideration received from the qualifying merchandise purchase i e sale generating the reward is allocated between the two units of account the sale and the reward for the purposes of revenue recognition since rewards earned impact sales and therefore gross margin as disclosed in our form k and management reviews the impact of this program relative to gross margin we discuss the financial impact of this program in conjunction with our gross margin analysis we believe that we have discussed the impact of fee increases and changes in the volume of memberships we disclosed in our form k that the increase in membership fee revenue was primarily due to raising our annual membership fees which occurred in november and january for new members and renewals respectively and membership sign ups at both existing and new warehouses we further disclosed that the fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues of approximately million in the remainder of the revenue increase is primarily related to increases in volume of new members in addition we disclosed that the remaining impact of increasing the membership fee will be immaterial to our results to inform the reader that the impact in future reporting periods would be significantly different than the current reporting period we calculate our membership renewal rate using a trailing calculation as disclosed in our form k based on historical data we have determined that of the members who renew their annual costco membership nearly all do so within six months of the expiration date as such measuring renewals only at the point of expiration would not provide investors an accurate picture of our renewal activity our calculation is designed to capture and quantify the percentage of those memberships that have had a full six months to renew by using memberships expiring seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date we are able to capture a full annual membership cycle memberships that have an expiration date in the six months prior to the end of our reporting period are excluded from this calculation regardless of whether or not they have been renewed for example our renewal rate calculation as of september included all memberships that had expiredbetween march and february these represented the base i e denominator of memberships used to evaluate the renewal rate using that same membership base to the extent the membership has been renewed as of the most recent month end prior to the reporting date it is included in the renewal count used as the numerator this calculation yields the reported renewal rate we believe our methodology is the most effective method for measuring our membership renewal rate more importantly it has been consistent in our reports allowing investors to make accurate comparisons period over period vs page please tell us what is meant when you cite investment in merchandise pricing as the reason for the decrease in gross margin if this represents price discounting you should make that clear in future similar situations response this phrase means reducing prices on key items to drive sales and holding prices steady in an environment of cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members accordingly it would not be accurate to use the phrase price discounting in addition to the fact that in some sense price discounting is what our entire business is about selling general and administrative expenses page you state in your overview that the higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability please discuss sga in mda on an absolute basis in addition to relative to sales james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionfebruary response a substantial portion of our selling general and administrative expense sga is attributable to payroll and benefits for our warehouse employees credit card processing and bank charges and utilities which are largely variable and correlate to sales we believe that a discussion of the absolute dollar changes in these expenses is not meaningful without reference to the underlying change in sales by discussing deviations in these expenses relative to sales we are able to provide a clear and straightforward disclosure of the reason for such changes to the extent that there are material changes in our sga expenses that generally do not vary with sales the most significant of which are depreciation and stock based compensation we have historically described the impact of those changes for example we disclosed the negative impact of increases in stock compensation expense and higher central operating costs predominantly related to the modernization of our information systems we believe our discussion of sga as a percentage of sales provides a meaningful discussion which enables investors to understand our results we believe any further discussion of the absolute dollar changes beyond what we have historically disclosed would result in duplicative information and would not promote further understanding of our results consolidated statements of comprehensive income page please refer to your foreign currency translation adjustment and other net line item please provide the disclosure required by asc in future filings or tell us why you believe such information is not required response we considered the disclosure required by asc and determined the amounts potentially requiring disclosure to be immaterial approximately million and are expected to be immaterial in future periods revenue recognition page you state in your description of business that in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction we generally accept returns of merchandise you further disclose in your financial statements that sales returns are net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs given your liberal return policy please advise how value is realized from merchandise returned including whether you are able to pass on the costs of returns back to specific suppliers please also quantify the amount of sales returns netted against sales for the past years and explain the reason for the increase in the sales return reserve finally tell us whether sales are reduced by amount of the estimated gross sales returns or the margin effect of such sales we may have further comment response there are three ways that value is realized from merchandise that is returned the first is that many returned items are still saleable for these items we realize value by returning the product to inventory and then selling the product again to our members second certain inventory can be returned to the vendor that initially sold us the product many of our vendor agreements allow for returned items to be returned to the vendor for a full refund of our purchase price the remainder of returns are disposed of when possible we sell these items to salvager companies and recoup some portion of the initial cost of the items all merchandise returns reduce net sales at the time merchandise is returned in addition we reduce net sales by the gross amount of the estimated future merchandise returns on sales recognized through the end of the reporting period at the end of fiscal years and the amounts netted against sales for expected future returns were million million and million respectively the sales return reserve approximates the gross margin related to the expected future merchandise to be returned in addition to an estimate of disposition costs for merchandise that will be disposed of or salvaged the increase in the sales returns reserve between fiscal and was primarily driven by the increase james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionfebruary in net sales in addition our estimate of the percentage of returned merchandise to be disposed of or salvaged increased based on historical experience stock repurchase programs page please disclose the cost flow assumption by which shares repurchased are deducted from additional paid in capital and returned earnings response repurchases of our common stock are made at market value as of the repurchase date in accordance with asc the excess of the repurchase price over par value is allocated between additional paid in capital and retained earnings the amount allocated to additional paid in capital is based on the estimated price at which the shares had been sold representing the total shares outstanding and the current value of additional paid in capital the remaining amount is recorded to retained earnings we believe we have made all the disclosures required under asc note segment reporting page you disclose your business is classified by management into three reporting segments further we note your first quarter earnings transcript where you state i n terms of sales comparisons geographically for the first quarter the better performing regions in the u s were in the southeast midwest and texas internationally in local currencies the better performing countries were canada mexico and australia please provide us with your analysis under asc that supported disclosing all operations as three reportable segments please include the following information in your response the operating segments you have identified in accordance with asc through if applicable the basis for aggregating identified operating segments into three reportable segments given the aggregation criteria in asc and quantitative thresholds in asc how the aggregation of all of your operations into three reportable segments complies with the aggregation criteria andthe process through which your chief operating decision maker reviews information to make decisions about resources to be allocated to your segments and assess their performance response our business model as described in our form k is consistently applied in each country in which we operate within the u s we have eight regions that are consolidated intothree u s divisions each with an executive vice president evp who reports directly to our president and ceo who we have determined to be our chief operating decision maker codm we have two regions in canada that consolidate into the canadian division which is managed by an evp that reports directly to our codm finally each of the other countries in which we operate is managed by a separate country manager who reports to an evp that reports directly to our codm each of these other countries represents a separate division the evps managing our divisions along with the other country managers execute our corporate strategy as determined by our codm on a periodic basis separate financial results for each division in the u s canada and in our other international divisions are provided to our codm for purposes of assessing each divisions performance the use of three divisions for our u s operations allows for an efficient execution of the decisions and objectives of the codm the regional structure allows for more effective operational management ensuring that our warehouses are given the appropriate support investment decisions are not made by region instead investment decisions are made by our codm regardless of region for example the decision to open a warehouse is made based upon a number of factors which include the availability of real estate regardless of division region or country and projected rates of return regardless of location based upon the guidance in asc through the manner in which resource allocation decisions are made and the divisional reporting structure for purposes of assessing performance we have concluded that each division represents an operating segment to be evaluated james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionfebruary for aggregation for purposes of assessing whether our three u s divisions may be aggregated into a single operating segment we evaluated the following aggregation criteria outlined in asc products available for sale within a particular warehouse are generally sourced by the respective centralized buying teams regardless of division as a result the nature of the merchandise is similar at all warehouses regardless of division within the u s which sell nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories each u s division has similar economic characteristics as the warehouse operations execute the same concept of high volume sales low cost and similar margins furthermore the financial metrics of these divisions are similar largely directionally consistent and follow the same general economic consumer trends for the u s we expect these divisions to continue to experience comparatively consistent results in the future the type and class of member is similar across all costco warehouses in the u s which offer both individual and business memberships the method of distributing products in the u s is similar through no frills self service warehouse facilities these facilities use the same general prototype for design and layout furthermore for purposes of evaluating the aggregation of the u s divisions we considered the objective of the segment disclosure as stated in asc c which is to provide information about the different types of business activities in which a public entity engages and the different economic environments in which it operates to help users of its financial statements better understand the public entitys performance better assess its prospects for future net cash flows and make more informed judgments about the public entity as a whole we believe that an aggregated presentation of financial information related to our u s divisions achieves this objective we have therefore concluded that the u s divisions may be aggregated into one operating segment and are then evaluated for reporting separate financial information following the quantitative thresholds of asc based upon the quantitative guidance in asc we have concluded that the u s and canada operating segments are each reportable segments as understood in asc furthermore we applied the guidance in asc which states that total external revenue of the reportable segments identified must constitute or more of the total consolidated revenue our u s and canadian reportable segments meet this reporting requirement none of our individual operating segments outside of the u s and canada meet the quantitative thresholds in asc considering the guidance in asc we have determined that it is appropriate to aggregate the other operating segments into an all other category as our other international reportable segment james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states
