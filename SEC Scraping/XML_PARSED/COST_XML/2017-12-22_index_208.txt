uncover the full extent nonprofit researchers and journalists have reported the existence of prison labor in various tiers of company supply chains in a myriad of product categories including but not limited to electrical wiring office furniture fruits vegetables seafood cheeses meats processed foods clothing and even packaging materials the existence of prison labor in our companys supply chain could have severe repercussions on costco brand name and shareholder value peer companies in the grocery sector have already experienced backlash when activists broke news stories that the retailers

to connection to violation of federal labor laws as an article reported in incarcerated workers are not expressly excluded from the definition of employee in workers protection statutes like the fair labor standards act flsa or the national labor relations act emphasis added the proposal suggests a full review to allow the company an opportunity to engage with suppliers to ensure the safety and well being of inmates producing our products and also to allow the company to head off any potential future litigation risks shareholder vote in favor will support managements planned policy changes and reporting management has disclosed a planned change to its code of conduct which will assure that prison labor is provided in voluntary fashion is fairly compensated and rendered under appropriate working conditions the proponent believes that these changes to the code of conduct are vital to the companys continued success and to protection of shareholder values the proponent feels that shareholder support of shareholder proposal will support company managements change of this code of conduct will foster a more thorough review of the supply chain and especially give management more clout as it approaches its suppliers to enforce the changes to the code of conduct policy conclusion the proponent believes that this proposal is in the best interest of the company because it
