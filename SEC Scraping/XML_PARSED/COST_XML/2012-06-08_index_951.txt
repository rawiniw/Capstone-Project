corporation finance washington d c re costco wholesale corp form k for the fiscal year ended august filed october response dated may file no dear mr mew in response to your letter of may the letter please see the discussion below which corresponds to the numbered paragraph in your letter form k for the fiscal year ended august item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page results of operations page we read your response to comment we note you tracked merchandise inventory and the related cost of sales primarily using the first in first out fifo method and that you account for your us merchandise inventory on a last in first out lifo basis for financial reporting purposes by recording lifo adjustments in an inflationary cost environment in this regard advise us how you compute the lifo adjustments in light of the different lifo pools you have to maintain for lifo inventory basis but not for fifo inventory basis provide us an example in your response to show how this process works further please explain to us in detail how fifo costs are representative of market especially in a deflationary environment where lifo inventory cost would be higher than the fifo inventory cost in this regard please clarify for us why you believe fifo approximates market in a deflationary environment in the lower of cost or market test in your situation please note that market as defined in asc means current replacement cost provided it shall not exceed net realizable value and it shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by allowance for an approximately normal profit margin please explain andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission june response advise us how you compute the lifo adjustments in light of the different lifo pools you have to maintain for lifo inventory basis but not for fifo inventory basis we apply the dollar value method to valuing lifo inventories under the dollar value method inventory items are grouped by pools and are priced in terms of each pools aggregate base year cost the result is compared with each pools aggregate base year cost as of the end of the prior year to determine whether the inventory level of each lifo pool has increased or whether a portion layer of the inventory has been liquidated we use the link chain computational technique in which the base year cost of ending inventory is determined by applying a cumulative index to the dollar value of the ending inventory the cumulative index is the relationship of the latest current year prices to those of the prior year based on double extension at the item level annual inflator deflator percentage multiplied by the prior years cumulative index causing each years index to be characterized as a link in a chain of indexes back to the base year the number of pools and use of the dollar value approach using the link chain computation technique have not changed since we first adopted lifo for financial reporting purposes in provide us an example in your response to show how this process works the following example demonstrates how this process works the numbers presented are for illustrative purposes only the annual inflator deflator percentage is derived by comparing the latest cost of each item in ending inventory to the cost of the same item at the end of the previous fiscal year or if a new item has been added the cost when the first purchase occurred the cost of all items in each pool is multiplied by the quantity in ending inventory and then totaled and used to compute the current year inflator deflator percentage please note that each items cost is used for purposes of this calculation which may differ from our fifo cost calculation using the retail inventory method rim the method primarily used to value our merchandise inventory the following example demonstrates how the annual inflator deflator is calculated pool total cost of items current year ending inventory valued at prior year cost current year ending inventory valued at current year cost percent change annual inflator pool this annual inflator deflator is then multiplied by the prior year cumulative lifo index link chain to develop a current year cumulative index pool annualinflatdor deflator cumulativeinflator andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission june current year ending inventory at current year cost using fifo rim is then divided by the current year cumulative inflator index to determine current year ending inventory at base year costs this value is compared to the prior year ending inventory at base year costs to calculate the current year increment the current year increment is then multiplied by the current year cumulative inflator index to calculate the current year lifo increment which is then added to the prior year ending inventory at lifo to derive the current year ending inventory at lifo this balance is then compared to the current year ending inventory at current year cost primarily using fifo rim to calculate the lifo reserve amount the example below illustrates this calculation pool current year ending inventory at current year cost fifo rim current year cumulative inflator index current year ending inventory at base year cost prior year ending inventory at base year cost current year increment at base year cost increment calculation current year increment at base year cost current year cumulative inflator index current year lifo increment prior year ending inventory at lifo current year ending inventory at lifo lifo adjustment calculation current year ending inventory at current year cost fifo rim current year ending inventory at lifo lifo reserve primarily the resulting lifo reserve amount for our pools is combined to determine the required lifo adjustment we believe that our business model creates an integrated product relationship among all inventory items such that they are not significantly dissimilar and that combining our pools to determine the required lifo adjustment most clearly reflects our periodic income as required by asc please explain to us in detail how fifo costs are representative of market especially in a deflationary environment where lifo inventory cost would be higher than the fifo inventory cost we consider our fifo inventory costs to be representative of market for the following reasons our information systems account for the value of most of our inventory using fifo rim rim is used by many retailers for approximating the cost basis of inventory based on current market retail prices of inventory cost valuation is determined by multiplying the retail value of inventory by the cost to retail ratio to arrive at inventory at cost because rim is based on the retail value of the ending inventory it automatically generates a lower of cost or market value as our markdowns to the retail price of inventory are taken on a timely basis we record any markdowns or losses for obsolescence or discontinued products at the item level on a timely basis consistent with the guidance of asc under rim when a markdown is taken the full markdown for all on hand inventory is recorded immediately at the time of the markdown andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission june our inventory generally turns over rapidly the overall average turnover for u s inventory is approximately times per year we do not experience a high degree of markdowns to the retail price of inventory or other losses for obsolete or discontinued products due to our high turnover and our merchandising philosophy of early in early out on seasonal merchandise please clarify for us why you believe fifo approximates market in a deflationary environment in the lower of cost or market test in your situation as described above fifo rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of fifo cost or market if the lifo value for inventories is greater than its fifo value inventories are recorded at the fifo value based on the foregoing we believe our computation of lifo inventory and our policy for evaluating the lower of cost or market rule are reasonable and consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states please contact me if you have
