responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the fourteen directors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business academia government service and other public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every third year the assessment seeks to identity specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences formal nomination of candidates by shareholders requires compliance with section of the bylaws there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines table of contents corporate governance guidelines the board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines which may be viewed at www costco com through the investor relations page board structure the corporate governance guidelines provide that the board does not require the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer and shall be free to choose its chairman in any way that it deems best for the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately the board believes that this structure is appropriate for the company at this time as a co founder of the company mr brotman has played a critical role in the growth of the company and his role as chairman will be complemented by the role of mr jelinek as president and chief executive officer and a more active participant in day to day management of the company in addition the board believes that it obtains effective additional board leadership through the role of the lead independent director currently filled by hamilton e james the lead independent director presides over executive sessions of the board and otherwise facilitates communication among senior management and the non employee directors the role of the board in risk oversight one of the boards functions is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management briefing on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate the audit committee also oversees issues related to internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning and reviews succession plans each year the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs table of contents compensation of directors the following table summarizes information regarding director compensation for the non

executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the committee the companys compensation programs have historically contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes that it has been desirable to continue compensation programs that have been persistent features at the company for a number of years table of contents the compensation levels approved by the committee for the named executive officers for fiscal are not materially changed from those approved for the prior year except for the increase in rsus granted to mr jelinek in connection with his promotion to chief operating officer and the decrease in rsus granted to mr sinegal at his request the committee established the elements of executive compensation for fiscal in the fall of before the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation in january the committee gave final approval to the actual fiscal compensation levels in october at that time the committee noted the results of the advisory shareholder vote with over of votes cast in favor and that vote has not caused the committee to recommend any changes to our compensation policies role of the compensation committee the committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of dr carson chair mr munger and ms ruckelshaus the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used consultants of any kind the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensation the components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation since fiscal consisting solely of rsus base salary a discretionary cash bonus program and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and modest perquisites the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not extensively reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages rsus rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation above others helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the short term with the performance conditions and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component payment of fixed cash compensation is consistent with the need for executive officers to have a predictable level table of contents of cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual adjustments with the exception of messrs sinegal and brotman whose salaries have remained at the same level since cash bonus discretionary cash bonuses are and have been a relatively small component of compensation they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements and perquisites consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has traditionally sought to have modest perquisites and other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k plan and the deferred compensation plan recognizing that the company does not have a traditional retirement plan and that no executive has any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing components of compensation combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent discretionary cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the vesting over five years of rsu awards and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation plan and k retirement plan matches the committee believes that the executive compensation programs do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by long term incentives including equity awards that vest over up to five years and share ownership guidelines which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests table of contents peer companies for fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation bjs wholesale club inc and lowes companies bjs wholesale club was taken private in september so public data concerning it were more limited these companies were selected because they all are recognized as successful retailers and two of them represent the two other major membership warehouse operators in utilizing the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee does not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it has used them only for general reference equity compensation if fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and when fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers during fiscal the board of directors determined to replace all stock option awards with awards of rsus since fiscal rsu grants to all executive officers have been performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon the executives maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation on the part of employees to improve the operations of the company over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that in the absence of accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for tax purposes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested rsus beginning in fiscal all officers and employees who receive rsu grants are eligible for accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period interim vesting for long service can occur in the case of certain terminations for rsu grants prior to the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november the criteria were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or pretax income with both measures based on local currency for mr sinegal the criteria were a increase versus fiscal in total sales or pretax income with both measures based on local currency after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were achieved accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant all rsu awards in fiscal were made under the companys fifth restated stock incentive compensation plan approved by the companys shareholders and the only equity plan maintained by the company table of contents other compensation the company provides the named executive officers with the benefits offered to all other employees in most respects the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that a certain percentage of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with certain perquisites including a car allowance the committee believes the benefits and perquisites are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these roles are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr sinegal which was the same as his contract for the prior fiscal year the contract term was for the fiscal year unless otherwise terminated earlier in accordance with its terms it provided for a base salary of it further provided for a cash bonus of up to determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee the company had the right to terminate mr sinegal for cause and he had the right to terminate the agreement on days notice mr brotman who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee has with the agreement of messrs brotman and sinegal treated them similarly for compensation purposes owing to the similarities in their historical and current contributions to the success of the company except that this year mr sinegal at his request received a smaller rsu grant apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control neither mr brotman nor mr sinegal has any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr brotman the same number granted for the prior fiscal year mr sinegal requested that his award be reduced to shares and the committee acceded to that request the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were met and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base salaries of messrs brotman and sinegal have been since fiscal cash bonuses have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal messrs brotman and sinegal each were awarded cash bonuses of in fiscal there are no fixed criteria applied by the committee in considering the amount of these bonuses generally mr sinegal recommends to the committee the bonus he believes is appropriate historically he has recommended modest amounts seeking to link his bonus as a percentage of that eligible amount stated in his employment contract to bonuses earned by employees generally eligible for the bonuses this year the company attained its internal net income goal and employees were eligible to receive the bonus award component associated with this goal roughly of the bonus potential mr sinegal recommended to the committee bonus amounts for other table of contents executive officers that were approximately of target amounts inclusive of the net income goal he requested a bonus for himself of approximately of his eligible amount accordingly mr sinegal requested a bonus of of the eligible amount in his employment agreement the committee approved this request and approved an equal award for mr brotman the committee observed that cash bonuses paid to chief executive officers at some peer companies are substantially higher the committee however wishes to respect mr sinegals desire to receive modest compensation in part because it believes that higher amounts would not change mr sinegals motivation and performance the committee has indicated in the past and continues to believe that messrs brotman and sinegal are underpaid the committee has also noted that messrs brotman and sinegal have for many years had direct and indirect economic interests in shareholdings of the company which further align their interests with the companys shareholders compensation of other named executive officers as noted above the most significant component of the compensation of the named executive officers is the award in fiscal of performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti jelinek portera and zook were and respectively the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr sinegal and were the same amounts as awarded in fiscal except for mr jelinek the award for mr jelinek was increased as a result of his new role as chief operating officer as noted above the performance criteria were attained and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as described above salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr sinegal who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level salary levels increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than messrs brotman and sinegal received discretionary cash bonuses ranging from approximately to approximately increased from the prior year bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr sinegal after the close of the fiscal year mr sinegal recommended bonus amounts to the committee of approximately of target amounts which ranged from to the committee maintains the discretion to vary from mr sinegals recommendation but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year as with all other employees roughly of the bonus potential was achieved due to the companys attainment of its internal net income target for fiscal eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the companys net income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibilities for each officer there is also a component not linked to any objective measure mr sinegal is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he can and does consider what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november table of contents stock ownership guidelines in fiscal the company adopted stock ownership requirements for executive officers by january all executive officers were required to own and maintain at least shares of common stock all executive officers are in compliance with this requirement impact of tax considerations the committee examined the equity compensation in light of the impact of section m of the internal revenue code which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of million in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation i e compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders rsus granted to our named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception in approving compensation types and levels the committee considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes it retains the ability to approve what it believes to be appropriate compensation even if the company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws conclusion the committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to its shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee of the companys board of directors has submitted the following report for inclusion in this proxy statement the committee has reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis contained in this

fiscal grants of plan based awards table grants made to our non employee directors in the last fiscal year are described in director compensation federal income tax consequences of awards and option exercises under the sixth restated plan the following is a general summary of the typical federal income tax consequences of the issuance and exercise of options under the plan it does not describe state or other tax consequences of the issuance and exercise of options nonstatutory stock options generally no federal income tax is payable by a participant upon the grant of an nso and no deduction is taken by the company under current tax laws if a participant exercises an nso he or she will have taxable income equal to the difference between the market price of common stock on the exercise date and the stock option grant price the company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction on its income tax return incentive stock options the grant of an iso has no federal income tax effect on the optionee upon exercise the optionee does not recognize income for regular tax purposes however the excess of the fair market value of the stock subject to an option over the exercise price of such option the option spread is includible in the optionees alternative minimum table of contents taxable income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax if the optionee does not dispose of the stock acquired upon exercise of an iso until more than two years after the option grant date and more than one year after exercise of the option any gain upon sale of the shares will be a long term capital gain if shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before both of these periods have expired a disqualifying disposition the option spread at the time of exercise of the option but not more than the amount of the gain on the sale or other disposition is ordinary income in the year of such sale or other disposition if the gain on a disqualifying disposition exceeds the amount treated as ordinary income the excess is taxable as capital gain which will be long term capital gain if the shares have been held more than one year after the date of exercise of the option the company is not entitled to a federal income tax deduction in connection with isos except to the extent that the optionee has taxable ordinary income on a disqualifying disposition stock awards stock bonus awards will generally be taxed in the same manner as nsos however shares issued pursuant to a stock award are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section of the code to the extent the shares will be forfeited in the event that the employee ceases to provide services to the company as a result of this substantial risk of forfeiture if applicable the employee will not recognize ordinary income at the time the shares are issued instead the employee will recognize ordinary income on the dates when the shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or when the shares become transferable if earlier the employees ordinary income is measured as the difference between the amount paid for the shares if any and the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares are no longer subject to forfeiture the employee may accelerate his or her recognition of ordinary income if any and begin his or her capital gains holding period by timely filing i e within thirty days of issuance of the shares an election pursuant to section b of the code in such event the ordinary income recognized if any is measured as the difference between the amount paid for the shares if any and the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares are issued and the capital gain holding period commences on such date the ordinary income recognized by an employee will be subject to tax withholding by the company unless limited by section m of the code the company is entitled to a deduction in the same amount as and at the time the employee recognizes ordinary income stock unit awards represent a promise to deliver shares in the future based on the vesting schedule accompanying the award at the time the shares are delivered the employee will recognize ordinary income equal to the difference between the amount paid for the shares if any and the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date the ordinary income recognized by an employee will be subject to tax withholding by the company generally in the form of shares unless limited by section m of the code the company is entitled to a deduction at the time and in the amount the employee recognizes ordinary income section m limitations section m of the code limits to per person the amount that the company may deduct for compensation paid to any of its most highly compensated executive officers in any year after under current regulations compensation received through an award or the exercise of an option will not be subject to the limit if the award and the plan meet certain requirements one such requirement is that the plan must state the maximum number of shares with respect to which award may be made to any employee during a specified period accordingly the second restated plan provides that no employee may be granted awards to acquire more than shares in any fiscal year of the company the company believes that stock options granted under the plan can qualify as performance based compensation and so compensation amounts arising in connection with such awards may not be subject to the loss deduction rule of section m stock awards may also qualify as performance based compensation so long as they are subject to performance table of contents criteria that qualify under the applicable tax rules if the stock awards so qualify compensation amounts arising in connection with such awards may not be subject to this loss deduction rule however the company may grant stock awards that are not subject to qualifying performance criteria and so it may not be able to deduct the full amount of compensation related to such stock awards to the extent the amount of compensation arising therefrom together with other compensation paid to the affected executive officer exceeds
