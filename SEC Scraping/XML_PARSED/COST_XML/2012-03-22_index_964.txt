corporation finance washington d c re costco wholesale corp form k for the fiscal year ended august filed october response dated february file no dear mr mew in response to your letter of march the letter please see the discussion below which corresponds to the numbered paragraphs in your letter form k for the fiscal year ended august item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page results of operations page we note your response to our prior comment and continue to believe that you should provide a separate operating results discussion for your canadian operations so investors can better understand and evaluate the performance of your business further we note your assertion that your canadian operations among all your operations are the most similar to your united states operations however it appears the canadian operations are economically dissimilar to the united states operations we note from the segment footnote that since fiscal the canadian operations have produced significantly higher revenue and operating income growth as compared to the united states operations in this regard we remain uncertain how your results of operations discussion adequately explains the significant growth behind your canadian operations accordingly we continue to believe you should revise to address your canadian operations separately from your united states operations in future filings andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission march response we note your comment above that since fiscal based upon the information disclosed in our segment footnote on page of our fiscal form k the canadian operations have produced significantly higher revenue and operating income growth as compared to the u s operations the primary factor driving the disparate growth in our canadian operations as compared to our u s operations was the effect of changes in the canadian dollar relative to the u s dollar year over year excluding the effect of changes in the canadian dollar relative to the u s dollar fiscal s total revenue and operating income growth versus fiscal in the u s and canada were as follows u s canada total revenue growth operating income growth comparable sales growth local currency throughout our mda pages through we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar which are references to the differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to convert our international operations financial results from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between the current periods currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year periods currency exchange rates while we disclose the total impact of foreign currencies on our consolidated results we do not disclose the impact by individual operating segments for example on pages and we state that foreign currencies strengthened against the u s dollar which positively impacted net sales and membership fees during by approximately and respectively of this combined positive impact resulting from changes in foreign currencies on consolidated total revenue was attributable to the strengthening of the canadian dollar while we do not agree that providing separate operating results for canada for each item in mda would be helpful to investors material variations in particular components might be material in any given quarter for example we agree that providing the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar by operating segment in future filings to the extent that the impact is material will allow investors to better understand and evaluate the performance of our business we note your response to our prior comment and we remain uncertain how you meet the requirements of item of regulation s k in this regard it appears you are facing an inflationary merchandise cost environment for example we noted your gross margin as a percentage of net sales declined by basis points in the first fiscal quarter of compared to similarly your fiscal gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased basis points compared to fiscal in this regard cost of merchandise sales is a material component in determining your gross margin amount and we believe a discussion and analysis of this material component will provide investors with the transparent information that is necessary for an understanding of your results of operation accordingly we believe you should revise your disclosure in future filings andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission march response in our form k for fiscal page we reported that gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased basis points the majority of this impact or basis points was due to an million lifo inventory charge recorded in as disclosed this charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories primarily food and sundries and gasoline in our first fiscal quarter of page the basis point decline in margin was due primarily to increased sales penetration of our lower margin gasoline business resulting from a increase in the average sales price per gallon page there was no lifo inventory charge in the first quarter of fiscal we will continue to discuss the impact of significant lifo adjustments which are indicative of inflationary or deflationary trends and their impact on our gross margin in our most recent form q for the second fiscal quarter ended february filed with the sec on march we expanded our quantitative summary table to include merchandise costs within our mda gross margin discussion the updated table indicates more clearly that gross margin is calculated by subtracting merchandise costs or cost of goods sold from net sales our updated quantitative summary table is as follows weeks ended weeks ended february february february february net sales less merchandise costs gross margin gross margin as a percent of net sales given the relationship between the effects that changes in merchandise costs have on changes in net sales we continue to believe that an analysis of the changes in gross margin best provides investors the necessary information to understand changes in merchandise costs the gross margin metric gross margin as a percent of net sales is the primary tool used by our management in its analysis of merchandise costs and we believe the one most used by our investors and many of the equity research analysts who provide written research on costco wholesale and other retailers to their client investors in addition a review of the top ten u s retailers sec filings will show that they too discuss gross margin or gross profit and do not have a separate discussion related to merchandise costs or cost of sales by expanding our disclosure as we have done in our second quarter form q we have provided investors additional information to more clearly understand the relationship between merchandise costs and net sales and the resulting impact on operations source http www stores org top retailers andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission march note summary of significant accounting policies page derivatives page we note your response to our prior comment tell us whether the contracts you entered into to mitigate the cost of energy used for your warehouses and other facilities can be net settled or are expected to be net settled and tell us if you have ever net settled any of the contracts if so explain to us how you consider the guidance under paragraphs asc and in your assessment on whether they qualify for the normal purchase and sale scope exception for electricity contracts please also advise us how you consider the additional criteria under paragraph c of asc in determining whether they qualify for the scope exception response asc and relate to the probability of physical settlement and require that for a derivative contract to qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale npns scope exception it must be probable at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will not settle net and will result in physical delivery the exception shall not be applied to a contract that requires cash settlements of gains or losses or otherwise settle gains or losses periodically because those settlements are net settlements at costco wholesale when a new electricity or natural gas energy forward contract becomes effective it is evaluated for qualification of the npns scope exception included in asc topic paragraphs through when we enter into fixed or variable priced contracts we intend to take physical delivery all of the contracts are considered requirements contracts for accounting purposes as understood in topic given that each has a determinable quantity based upon our estimate of future requirements using historical energy usage data typically the past two to three years these contracts prohibit resale of any energy quantities to a third party net settlement is not required or expected and physical delivery of quantities specified in the contracts throughout the term of the contracts is considered probable at inception we do not have a history of net settling these contracts however there have been rare isolated instances where our energy consumption for a discrete period of time was less than the minimum determinable quantity included in the contract the net settlement would occur only for the quantity shortage between the actual energy quantities physically delivered and any stated minimum energy quantity threshold for a discrete period of time during the contract period if applicable not the total energy quantity physically delivered any net settlement would represent a small percentage of the physical quantities delivered under an individual contract and would be considered by us to be isolated notwithstanding these rare instances we continue to believe that physical delivery is probable throughout the term of the contracts as specified in our fixed priced energy contracts additional energy quantities physically delivered above the specified determinable contracted amounts are purchased at the current market price on the date of delivery of these quantities the optionality quantity feature relating to the purchase of additional energy units above the determinable amounts does not provide us benefit beyond the assurance of a guaranteed energy supply for use in the normal course of our business pricing in variable priced contracts for physical delivery of energy quantities is based on current market prices in your comment you have specifically requested that we advise you of how we considered the criteria under asc c in determining how we qualify for the npns scope exception for our forward contracts to purchase electricity our electricity contracts are considered power purchase agreements as the term is understood in topic we note that asc paragraph which relates specifically to qualification of the npns scope exception for power purchase or sale agreements that are capacity contracts defined in topic as an agreement by an owner of capacity to sell the right to that capacity to another party so that it can satisfy its obligations for example in the electric industry capacity sometimes referred to as installed capacity is the capability to deliver electric power to the electric transmission system of an operating control area andrew d mew accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission march deciding whether an option contract is a capacity contract or a traditional option contract is a matter of judgment and our judgment has been that our contracts are not capacity contracts otherwise to qualify for the npns scope exception under asc paragraph we would have to be an entity that engages in the sale of electricity to retail or wholesale customers and as the buyer we would have to be statutorily or otherwise contractually obligated to maintain sufficient capacity to meet electricity needs of our electricity customer base electricity contracts between costco wholesale as a large retail buyer and an electricity provider could not meet the requirement of asc paragraph related to statutory or contractual obligation forward contracts with optionality for the purchase of electricity that do not meet this criterion of asc paragraph are nevertheless eligible to qualify for the npns scope exception by meeting all the requirements in asc paragraphs through satisfying asc paragraph requires that the company does not have a history of net settlement satisfying asc paragraphs through requires that where the electricity contracts have optionality in quantity that the additional quantities are bought or sold at market prices as indicated in our response to you we believe that we have met all of the requirements of asc paragraphs through to be able to designate our electricity contracts as meeting the npns scope exception in any event our fixed price energy contracts are generally short in duration as included in the tabular disclosures page for contractual obligations in item in our form k for fiscal the amounts disclosed for our commitments to make future payments under open fixed price energy contracts are included as a subset of the amounts disclosed for purchase obligations property equipment services and other of the amounts disclosed of and for payments due in fiscal and respectively the component amounts pertaining to open fixed price energy contracts totaled and for fiscal and respectively which are not considered to be material in relation to our consolidated financial statements please contact me if you have any questions or further comments sincerely costco wholesale
