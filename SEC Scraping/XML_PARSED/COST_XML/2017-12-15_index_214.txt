committee financial expert as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission sec in order to ensure continuing auditor independence the audit committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the external auditors in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the external auditor s lead engagement partner the audit committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner the audit committee met seventimes during fiscal a report of the audit committee is set forth below compensation committee the compensation committees function is to review the salaries bonuses and stock based compensation provided to executive officers of the company and to oversee the overall administration of the companys compensation and stock based compensation programs except with respect to setting the compensation of the chief executive officer the committee may delegate its authority to a subcommittee of the committee consisting either of a subset of members of the committee or any members of the board who would be eligible to serve on the committee in addition to the extent permitted by applicable law the committee may delegate to one or more executive officers of the company the authority to grant stock awards to employees who are not executive officers or members of the board the committee has

conduct the committee is authorized by its charter to engage its own advisors the committee approved the nomination of the candidates reflected in proposal the board is responsible for nominating members for election to the board and for filling vacancies on the board that may occur between annual meetings of shareholders the committee is responsible for identifying screening and recommending to the board candidates for board membership when formulating its recommendations the committee will also consider advice and recommendations from others as it deems appropriate the members of the committee are messrs raikes chair and evans and mrs wilderotter the committee met fivetimes in fiscal the committee will consider shareholder recommendations for candidates to serve on the board in accordance with our bylaws the name of any recommended candidate together with pertinent biographical information a document indicating the candidates willingness to serve if elected and evidence of the nominating shareholders ownership of company stock should be sent to the secretary of the company the company may require additional information as described in our bylaws our corporate governance guidelines provide that nominees for director will be selected on the basis of among other things knowledge experience skills expertise integrity diversity ability to make independent analytical inquiries and understanding of the companys business environment all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the board at the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the twelvedirectors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business and public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every year the assessment seeks to identify specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences recommendations arising from the self assessment process in fiscal primarily related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the committees of the board since the board led by the nominating and governance committee has been engaged in a process to refresh its membership since the beginning of that process five members have or will soon be retired and three new independent directors have been added most recently mr denman whose potential candidacy the committee learned of through mr brotman was elected to the board on march the refreshment process is continuing our bylaws provide for proxy access by eligible shareholders shareholder nominations require compliance with section of the bylaws which are available on our website there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines corporate governance guidelines the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines which may be viewed at www costco com through the investor relations page board structure the corporate governance guidelines provide that the board does not require the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer and shall be free to choose its chairman in any way that it deems best for the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately the board believes that this structure is appropriate for the company at this time our co founder jeff brotman served as chairman of the board until his death in august hamilton james an independent director was subsequently elected as non executive chairman of the board the role of the board in risk oversight one board function is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management reports on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate and oversees internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs compensation of directorseach non employee director

compensation for our chief executive officer and for fiscal our chairman for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of messrs munger and stanton chair the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used any the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers for the current fiscal year ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensationthe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation consisting solely of performance based rsus base salary cash bonuses and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages performance based rsus performance based rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the shorter term with the one year performance conditions and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention the committee s view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirements provide a long term dimension to the equity awards base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual increases cash bonus cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation and subject to caps are awarded at the discretion of the committee based on a variety of metrics they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view generally lower than those at other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k and the deferred compensation plans these components of compensation mix incentives that are intended to reward shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of a one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent cash bonuses that are subject to one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the rsu award vesting of up to five years and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation and k plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by longer term incentives including equity awards that vest up to five years and share ownership requirements which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests in addition the companys corporate governance guidelines include a claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that has been earned by improper means peer companiesfor fiscal the committee primarily considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company and lowes companies this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these companies were selected because they are recognized as successful retailers and one of them represents the other major membership warehouse operator that is publicly traded the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensationif fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers rsu grants to all executive officers are performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that subject to accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for minimum statutory withholding taxes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period this accelerated vesting entitles officers and employees to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or of the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date the criteria for the fiscal performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or a increase in pre tax income with both measures based on local currencies after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were exceeded accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for at least a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant for those not fully vested at the time the rsus were deemed earned dollar values for grants in fiscal based on the closing share price on the business day preceding the grant date were not increased from the grants values in fiscal the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all grants in fiscal were made under the companys seventh restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders in january and currently the company s only equity plan other compensationthe company provides the named executive officers with benefits of a type offered to all other employees in most respects the value of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain eligible employees approximately including the named executive officers the plan provides that the first of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with a car allowance there is a company match for certain charitable contributions the committee believes the benefits are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the former chairman of the boardin addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and for fiscal the chairman mr brotman served as the company s executive chairman until his death on august he was succeeded by hamilton james who serves as non executive chairman and receives no compensation beyond that paid to other non executive members of the board near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr jelinek related to service during fiscal subsequently extended to calendar as chief executive officer the agreement provided for an annual base salary of based on a fifty two week year unchanged from the prior year the agreement further provided for a cash bonus of up to unchanged from the prior year determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee mr brotman former executive chairman did not have an employment agreement his salary in fiscal was apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control neither mr brotman nor mr jelinek nor any other employee has or had any change in control arrangement with the company for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus each to mr brotman and mr jelinek the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service in the case of mr brotman all rsu s vested in connection with his death in accordance with the agreements covering his grants cash bonuses for the chief executive officer and through fiscal the chairman of the board have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal mr jelinek earned a cash bonus of the bonus amount for mr jelinek was determined by the committee as follows i one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company s attainment of its pre tax income goal which was fully achieved in fiscal and ii eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to these executive officers are described below no bonus was paid with respect to mr brotman as he was not employed at the time of bonus payments as required by the plan compensation of other named executive officersthe most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti zook portera and moulton were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr jelinek and approved by the compensation committee before grant as noted above the performance criteria were exceeded and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted with accelerated vesting for long service and further time based vesting salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels for these officers increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than messrs brotman and jelinek received cash bonuses of up to more than the prior year because the company met the pre tax income goal for fiscal unlike the prior year bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee for the named executive officers of up to approximately or of the eligible amounts as with other bonus eligible employees of the bonus potential was related to the company s attainment of its internal pre tax income target for fiscal that target was billion on a generally accepted accounting principles basis the target was achieved as actual pre tax income was billion based on mr jelinek s recommendation the committee determined to award all of the potential pre tax income bonus eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the company s pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officer s area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pre tax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales and gross margin in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a small component approximately of total bonus eligibility based on the discretion of mr jelinek mr jelinek is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he considers what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances subject to the caps noted above the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendations but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november clawback policythe corporate governance guidelines provide that the company will seek to recover at the direction of the committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so incentive compensation including bonus incentive payment and equity award awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment where the incentive compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis the committee may determine in its discretion the amount if any by which the payment or award should be reduced in addition if an officer engaged in intentional misconduct as determined by the committee in its sole discretion that contributed to the award or payment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the misconduct the company may take other remedial and recovery action as determined by the committee stock ownership requirementsexecutive officers are required by the end of each calendar year to own and retain shares of company common stock representing in value at least three times seven times for the chief executive officer the base salary of the officer in effect at the beginning of the fiscal year prior to october the requirement was shares for all executive officers newly promoted officers have twenty four months to achieve compliance the nominating and governance committee may authorize an extension should the timing present an undue burden hedging and pledging policythe corporate governance guidelines prohibit transactions involving hedging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of the board and prohibit pledging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of a designated trading compliance committee which reviews risks of proposed transactions impact of tax considerationsthe committee examined compensation in light of section m of the internal revenue code of as amended which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of one million dollars in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders performance based rsus granted to named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception the committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service conclusionthe committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directorsthe compensation committee of the companys board of directors has submitted the following report for inclusion in this proxy statement the committee has reviewed and discussed with management

to be one of six entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to what matters in corporate governance by lucien bebchuk alma cohen and allen ferrell of the harvard law school https papers ssrn com sol papers cfm abstract kn supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management for example the classification of directors at our company may be altered or eliminated only by an amendment approved by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group entitled to vote on such amendment consider that being a classified board contributes to the fact that the average length of director tenure was over years as of the date this proposal was submitted our prior proposal on this topic at costco in received of the vote in favor we waited patiently for our board to implement the will of the majority but they did not do so this proposal topic won from to support at weyerhaeuser alcoa waste management goldman sachs firstenergy mcgraw hill macys and ferro currently a minority can frustrate the will of our shareholder majority in other words a minority could have the power to prevent shareholders from improving our corporate governance please vote to enhance shareholder value simple majority vote proposal board of directors responseunder costco wholesales governing documents a simple majority vote standard generally applies to all matters submitted to a shareholder vote this standard means that a proposal is approved if the number of votes cast in favor exceeds the number of votes cast against or to the extent required by washington law the proposal is approved by a majority of the outstanding shares the one exception is that as permitted by washington law approval by two thirds of the shares outstanding is required to amend our articles of incorporation with respect to classification of the board since the company went public in its articles have required that directors be elected for three year terms and that approximately one third of the board seats are up for election every year the board believes that this classified board structure is an integral component of the companys long term approach to the creation of shareholder value and has contributed significantly to the companys long term operational success and delivery of strong shareholder returns the board also believes that any change to the classified board structure should occur only pursuant to a vote that is representative of a broad base of the companys shareholders in shareholders voted on a binding proposal to amend the articles to declassify the board this proposal failed not only to achieve the two thirds threshold necessary to approve the amendment it failed to obtain the vote of even a majority of shares outstanding absent broad shareholder support to declassify the board continues to believe that the classified structure should be retained as should the two thirds voting requirement designed to ensure that there is a broad consensus of shareholder support before that structure is changed in shareholders voted in favor of a proposal similar to the current simple majority vote proposal in response the board proposed amendments to the companys articles to eliminate supermajority requirements other than that concerning amendment of the classified board provision those amendments were approved by the shareholders in the board recommends that shareholders vote againstthe proposal for the following reasons which are discussed in more detail below the costco model for shareholder value creation is grounded in a long term approach that includes the companys classified board structure this model has been proven to return value as costco has demonstrated sustained strong financial performance under its classified board the classified board structure is designed to safeguard against short term shareholders agitating for changes inconsistent with long term value creation the article cited by the proponent ignores recent studies finding that classified boards do not negatively impact firm value the costco model is grounded in a board that is committed to a long term approachthe costco model uses a long term approach to generate growth in shareholder value the company is guided by directors who have dedicated themselves to three year terms on the board the board knows that transitory increases in costcos share price might be achieved if prices were raised wages were cut suppliers were pressed for onerous terms and the balance sheet were burdened with significant leverage these are changes that short term shareholders or short term board members might seek but the costco board with its long term commitment focus has determined that such actions would damage the long term value of the company by harming relationships with members employees and suppliers the costco model has proven its ability to create valuethe proponent of this proposal does not allege that the companys economic performance or its returns to shareholders have been unsatisfactory or that the challenged voting requirement has actually impeded performance to the contrary under the classified board structure costco has demonstrated sustained strong financial performance net sales have grown at an annualized rate of since costco wholesale was taken public in net income has grown at an annualized rate of over that same period total shareholder return tsr which includes share price appreciation and dividends has been exemplary source factset market data as of december key comparable companies include kroger target and wal mart large cap retailers include best buy kohls lowe s and walgreens the board has been vigilant in seeing capital returned to shareholders since the company has raised its annual dividend from forty cents to and repurchased approximately billion of the companys shares in may the company paid a special cash dividend of over billion or per share the company also paid special cash dividends of in and of in costcos long term focus extends to its employees and membersthe company seeks to develop long term relationships with employees those working in the companys membership warehouses receive pay and benefits more generous than their counterparts at competitors this long term investment in its workforce has benefited the company with greater loyalty and the company consequently benefits through what it believes to be the lowest employee turnover rates and the lowest shrink inventory loss rate in the industry in addition equity grants are a meaningful portion of compensation for over employees including more than managers and assistant managers in our distribution centers and membership warehouses in the united states equity grants vest over periods up to five years which provides long term incentives to recipients for senior management in fiscal over of compensation was in the form of equity in addition relative compensation measures indicate the companys senior management is generally compensated below the peer median the company is also recognized for its long term approach to its members through its investments in lower pricing seeking to bring goods to market with the lowest cost through expense control and minimal mark ups the company has developed what it believes to be a very strong reputation among its members for offering low prices the board and the company have consistently determined that instead of raising short term margins it is better to build loyalty among costco members by charging lower prices that strategy has resulted in over of members globally renewing their memberships the classified board structure is designed to protect shareholder interests against investors with short term intereststhe board has studied the potential benefits and harms of declassification for over a decade including various studies of companies with classified boards discussed below while reviewing these studies over the years and recognizing that the potential adverse impacts of a classified board cited in some of the studies may be relevant for some companies the board has noted the gap between those adverse possibilities and the very positive experiences of costco shareholders under the company s classified structure the board continues to believe that the classified board structure serves as a safeguard against short term shareholders agitating for changes inconsistent with a long term value creation the board recognizes that the classified structure could delay the success of an acquisition proposal that has broad shareholder support but is opposed by the board the board also acknowledges that there may be situations where the board and some shareholders do not agree about what a full and fair acquisition proposal might be the board believes however that the risk of any value loss through a delay in a transaction is outweighed by the protection that the structure provides against abusive or improvident tactics the current voting standard requires broad shareholder support before a fundamental change is adopted that could impact the companys mission and long term objectives recent studies find that the classified board structure does not have a negative impact on firm value the proponent cites a paper claiming that supermajority voting requirements and classified boards negatively impact firm valuations and shareholder returns the proponent fails however to recognize relevant subsequent research literature and debate specifically the purported value of declassification more recent studies conducted on firms that had declassified their boards found that declassification is associated with either a decline in firm value or had no significant impact on firm value these studies sparked a response that was also criticized as ignoring evidence that firm values declined after declassifications at companies targeted by the project approval processshareholder approval of this proposal would not itself amend the articles no amendment would occur unless authorized by the board and then approved by the shareholders through an affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors for the reasons set forth above the board of directors unanimously believes that this proposal is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and recommends that you vote against

response to a shareholder proposal if properly presented at the meeting the company will hold a vote on the following whereas financial and operational risks related to the sale of goods produced with prison labor such as reputational damage litigation and supply chain disruption can adversely affect shareholder value our companys supplier code of conduct prohibits illegal prison labor the use of prison or convict labor must be consistent with laws where the merchandise is manufactured and with the laws where it is imported prison labor is legally permissible in the united states and other

companies such as produce office chairs clothing and packaging materials companies enjoy low overhead costs and potentially other benefits such as tax breaks watchdogs assert that prison labor is often deployed in an inhumane manner that fails to balance cost savings to companies against treatment of prisoners although slavery and involuntary servitude were abolished by the thamendment an exception was made for punishment for crime although some u s prisoners may receive wages ranging from to per hour in the u s and worldwide many inmates are forced to work for no pay at all and in unsafe or unhealthy conditions the use of prison labor in supply chains can undermine a retailer s reputation in whole foods experienced significant backlash when customers learned that prisoner made products were sold in stores although the companys supplier code of conduct leads to occasional audits of suppliers for certain potential issues it lacks sufficient attention to the use of prison labor careful review of our supply chain for prison labor could help costco ensure that risk to its reputation and shareholder value is minimized by demonstrating effective company oversight resolved shareholders of costco urge the board of directors to adopt a policy committing the company to a survey all suppliers to identify sources of prison labor in the companys supply chain b develop and apply additional criteria or guidelines for suppliers regarding the use of prison labor and c report to shareholders no later than june at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information on costcos progress in implementing the policy supporting statement the proponent recommends that the companys progress report include summary of results of the supplier survey including actual and or potential sources of prison labor identified and in particular any use of a suppliers who employ prison labor with compulsory uncompensated or severely undercompensated work programs b suppliers who employ prison labor from privately run prisons summary of new criteria and guidelines for the use of prison labor methodologies to be used to track audit and measure supplier performance nature and extent of consultation with relevant stakeholders in connection with the policy development and implementation examples of topics for possible guidelines or criteria could include consideration of a minimum wage and or overtime pay for inmate laborers safety health conditions supplier provided job matching programs for inmates upon release board of directors responsesince its inception the costco supplier code of conduct has prohibited prison labor that is unlawful in the country where it is performed in united states law concerning importation of goods made with convict labor or and forced labor or and indentured labor under penal sanction was strengthened with the elimination of an exception that had been broadly applied to allow such imports where domestically produced supply was not sufficient to meet domestic demand in early the company began a closer examination of the use of lawful prison labor in its supply chain this was a product of the recent changes in u s law and an awareness of greater concerns among some u s consumers after examining this issue more deeply we have come to understand its complexity and the positions that have been articulated in favor of and in opposition to the use of even lawful prison labor supporters maintain that legal prison labor programs offer participants an opportunity that is more attractive than idle or other time spent in confinement opportunities for compensation and restitution and an opportunity for rehabilitation with the potential for employment after confinement those opposed to legal prison labor programs cite challenges in assuring that participation is truly voluntary the absence of private sector levels of compensation unsafe working conditions and other flaws some opponents also link the issue of legal prison labor to debates around the use of incarceration generally the company has not identified any consensus on the correct approach as part of enforcing its code of conduct costco conducts thousands of audits annually around the globe with qualified independent third parties in addition its buying and quality assurance staffs spend countless hours visiting production facilities as part of the process of bringing quality merchandise to our members through these efforts we have not seen significant levels of prison labor in our supply chain we have seen it occasionally in the united states in the agricultural products segment where it is permitted by federal and state laws the company is committed under its code of conduct to protecting the working rights and safety of the people who produce process or harvest the merchandise it sells and appreciates that certain of its members might have particular concerns in this area the company accordingly is developing changes to the code of conduct with respect to lawful prison labor which it expects to finalize by no later than june these changes will articulate more specific requirements concerning among other things assuring that such labor is provided in voluntary fashion is fairly compensated and rendered under appropriate working conditions we will also take due account of risks associated with the use of prison labor under the laws of the united states and other countries where we import goods and countries from which we source goods the revised requirements will be enforced in the same fashion as other requirements in our code of conduct primarily through the use of independent third party audits we will closely monitor our experiences in this area and may determine to institute more restrictive policies as a result if adopted and implemented the shareholder proposal would impose unnecessary restrictions and burdens on the company the company believes that a requirement to survey each of its over suppliers around the globe concerning prison labor would be costly time consuming and unnecessary in light of the experience the company has through prior audits and other measures concerning the low incidence of lawful prison labor in its supply chain in light of these factors and the companys existing procedures and its commitments as outlined above the board of directors believes that implementing the proposal would not be an effective and prudent use of the companys time and resources for the reasons set forth above the board of directors unanimously believes that this proposal is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and recommends that you vote against proposal proxies solicited by the board of directors will be voted against this proposal unless a
