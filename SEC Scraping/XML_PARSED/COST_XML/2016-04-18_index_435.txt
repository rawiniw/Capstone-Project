co branded credit card transition your disclosure only addresses the benefits that you will receive from the new program agreement once it is implemented please tell us any negative impacts you experienced during fiscal from this credit card transition and how you considered discussing such impacts in your analysis of results of operations as part of your response please tell us the extent to which new credit card sign ups slowed or ceased during fiscal and explain why your analysis of results did not discuss a decrease in bounty revenue and its impact on your gross margin or net income response in preparing our fiscal form k we evaluated the impact of the credit card transition on our sales gross margin and selling general and administrative expenses although there jennifer thompson accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission april was a slowdown in co branded credit card sign ups due to the impending credit card transition the negative impact was immaterial to our results of operations for fiscal and therefore not separately discussed in our managements discussion and analysis mda we did not stop actively signing up members for credit cards until the first quarter of our fiscal the resulting negative impact of lower bounty revenue was disclosed in our forms q for the first and second quarters gross margin q the decrease in core was primarily driven by a reduction in the sales penetration in food and sundries and a decrease in the bounty revenue earned for new co branded credit card signs ups in the u s we expect to be negatively impacted by the decrease in bounty revenue until we transition to our new co branded credit card arrangement at p q these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our core merchandise categories of three basis points primarily as a result of lower bounty revenue earned for new co branded credit card sign ups in the u s we expect to be negatively impacted by the decrease in bounty revenue until we transition to our new co branded credit card arrangement at p we note your statement that loyalty rewards earned by co branded cardholders are expected to be in the form of certificates redeemable at costco for cash or merchandise we have the following comments please confirm our assumption if true that citi will reimburse you for the face value of those certificates please tell us the basis for your statement that you expect most cardholders will redeem the certificates for merchandise if you make a similar disclosure in future filings please disclose the basis for this belief including whether reward certificates were historically redeemable for cash also tell us how you will account for certificates that are redeemed for cash response we will accept these certificates as a form of payment from our members and receive reimbursement from citi for the total dollar value of reward certificates redeemed as jennifer thompson accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission april disclosed in the form k item b loyalty rewards provided to cardholders under the program will primarily be funded by citi but also partially funded by costco under certain circumstances our statement that we expect that most cardholders will redeem certificates for merchandise was based on historical redemption data available from our system which identifies whether certificates are redeemed for cash or used for merchandise purchases we will revise our future disclosure to the extent it is made to state under the previous co brand credit card program reward certificates were redeemable for merchandise or cash based on historical redemption patterns costco expects that most cardholders will redeem reward certificates for merchandise redeemed reward certificates will be recorded as a receivable whether the redemption is for cash or used for merchandise purchases citi will then reimburse costco for reward certificates redeemed note income taxes page we note you changed your position in the fourth quarters of and regarding the undistributed earnings of your canadian operations such that a portion of the earnings were no longer considered permanently reinvested please tell us in significantly more detail the facts and circumstances which led to the changes in your position and the underlying reasons for repatriating these earnings further tell us in detail how you evaluated the criteria for the exception to recognition of a deferred tax liability in accordance with asc and for the remaining canadian undistributed earnings that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in this regard describe the type of evidence that sufficiently demonstrates that remittance of the remaining canadian earnings will be postponed indefinitely as part of your response please quantify the amount of cumulative undistributed earnings from your canadian operations for which you have not provided for u s deferred taxes and quantify the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by your canadian operations response asc provides that a parent entity may overcome the presumption in asc that all undistributed earnings of a subsidiary will be transferred to the parent entity and such undistributed earnings included in consolidated income generally shall be accounted for as a temporary difference and therefore will not have to accrue income taxes jennifer thompson accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission april on the undistributed earnings of its subsidiary if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax free liquidation this would include a situation where repatriation of earnings would result in no recognition of a deferred liability on a regular basis costco evaluates various criteria in accordance with asc and these have included the following the vast majority of costcos operations are located in the united states u s and the united states operations historically have been able to meet their cash needs without the need to draw upon cash from non u s subsidiaries conversely most of our foreign subsidiaries are less mature than the operations in the united states and canada and generally have a high ratio of cash needs to cash generation capacity making it likely that costco would seek to use any excess cash generated in canada in one or more of these other countries rather than repatriating those earnings to the united states with particular respect to canada investments in securities of like kind and risk have historically generated higher returns in canada than in the united states based on these factors as well as the cash needs of the canadian subsidiaries as a general matter costco has considered the earnings of the canadian subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested accordingly no accrual was made historically for united states income tax concerning those earnings although we have historically asserted that foreign undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate undistributed earnings to the extent we can do so without adverse tax consequence with respect to fiscal and costco determined that a portion of canadian earnings could be repatriated without adverse tax consequences the determination in both cases was based in part on substantial weakening of the canadian dollar versus the u s dollar which directly impacted the foreign tax credit associated with the partial repatriation of these earnings resulting in immaterial tax consequences for each change in our position on permanent reinvestment as disclosed in our form k for and neither event however changed the fundamental premises of our analysis under asc and as described above as of the end of fiscal our canadian subsidiaries had million of cumulative undistributed earnings and basis on which u s deferred taxes have not been provided and million of cash and cash equivalents at that time costco had unremitted earnings and basis on which u s taxes had been provided but which had not been distributed of million net of this anticipated distribution ending cash and cash equivalents at the end of jennifer thompson accounting branch chief united states securities and exchange commission april fiscal in canada would have been million this balance continues to be subject to the premises of the costcos asc and as described above this cash is expected to be used to fund operations in canada giving due consideration to cyclical cash needs and needs of costco subsidiaries outside the united states to the extent not needed in canada and the cash needs of the united states operations will not require access to those funds at the end of fiscal the u s operations had billion in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as you requested we acknowledge
