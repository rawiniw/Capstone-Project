any recommended candidate together with pertinent biographical information a document indicating the candidates willingness to serve if elected and evidence of the nominating shareholders ownership of company stock should be sent to the secretary of the company the company may require additional information as described in our bylaws our corporate governance guidelines provide that nominees for director will be selected on the basis of among other things knowledge experience skills expertise integrity diversity ability to make independent analytical inquiries and understanding of the companys business environment all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the board at the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the fourteen directors on the board two are women and one is african american in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business academia government service and other public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every third year the assessment seeks to identity specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences formal nomination of candidates by shareholders requires compliance with section of the bylaws there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines corporate governance guidelines the board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines which may be viewed at www costco com through the investor relations page board structure the corporate governance guidelines provide that the board does not require the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer and shall be free to choose its chairman in any way that it deems best for the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately the board believes that this structure is appropriate for the company at this time as a co founder of the company mr brotman has played a critical role in the growth of the company and his role as chairman will be complemented by the role of mr jelinek as table of contents president and chief executive officer and a more active participant in day to day management of the company in addition the board believes that it obtains effective additional board leadership through the role of the lead independent director currently filled by hamilton e james the lead independent director presides over executive sessions of the board and otherwise facilitates communication among senior management and the non employee directors the role of the board in risk oversight one of the boards functions is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management briefing on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate the audit committee also oversees issues related to internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning and reviews succession plans each year the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs compensation of directors the following table summarizes information regarding director compensation for the non employee directors of

ruckelshaus the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used any the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensation the components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation since fiscal consisting solely of rsus base salary a discretionary cash bonus program and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and modest perquisites the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave table of contents more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages rsus rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation above others helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the short term with the performance conditions and in the longer term with time vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component this compensation is consistent with the need for executive officers to have a predictable level of cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual adjustments with the exception of mr brotman whose salary has remained at the same level since and mr sinegal whose salary remained the same from until he stepped down from the role of ceo in at which point his salary was reduced in both cases they received slightly higher amounts in fiscal years with weeks including fiscal year cash bonus discretionary cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements and perquisites consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest perquisites and other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k plan and the deferred compensation plan recognizing that the company does not have a traditional retirement plan and that no executive has any agreement to receive severance compensation the foregoing components of compensation combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of at least one one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent discretionary cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the vesting over five years of rsu awards and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation plan and k retirement plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonableness in risk taking behavior the value of short term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by long term incentives including equity awards that vest over up to five years and share ownership guidelines which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests table of contents peer companies for fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company and lowes companies this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal except that the kroger company was added to replace bjs wholesale club which ceased to be a publicly traded company in these companies were selected because they all are recognized as successful retailers and one of them represents the other major membership warehouse operator in utilizing the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensation if fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and when fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers in the board of directors determined to replace the stock option award program with awards of rsus since fiscal rsu grants to all executive officers have been performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon the executives maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that in the absence of accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for tax purposes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus beginning in fiscal all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period interim vesting for long service can occur in the case of certain terminations for rsu grants prior to the performance criteria for the performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or pretax income with both measures based on local currency after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were achieved accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october with the exception of the grant to mr liebenson in april see note on page and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all rsu awards in fiscal were made under the companys fifth restated stock incentive compensation plan approved by the companys shareholders and the only equity plan maintained by the company table of contents other compensation the company provides the named executive officers with the benefits offered to all other employees in most respects the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that a certain percentage of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with certain perquisites including a car allowance the committee believes the benefits and perquisites are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board in addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these roles are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved written employment contracts for mr sinegal and mr jelinek related to their service during fiscal as chief executive officer the contract term for mr sinegal was for the period of time from the beginning of the fiscal year through december the contract term for mr jelinek was for january through the end of the fiscal year the agreements provided for mr sinegal to get a pro rata portion of his annual base salary of and mr jelinek to receive a pro rata portion of his annual base salary of based on their months of service as chief executive officer during fiscal the agreements further provided for both mr sinegal and mr jelinek to get a ratable share of a cash bonus of up to determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee mr brotman who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement with the company generally the committee has treated mr brotman similarly to the chief executive officer for compensation purposes apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control none of messrs brotman sinegal or jelinek has any severance or change in control arrangement with the company nor does any other employee for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr brotman the same number granted for the prior fiscal year mr jelinek was granted performance based rsus consistent with the amount granted to mr sinegal in his role as ceo prior to fiscal when mr sinegal at his own request received a smaller grant of performance based rsus for fiscal mr sinegal was awarded rsus one third of his prior year grant of shares in proportion to the amount of time during fiscal which he served as ceo the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were met and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service the base salaries of mr brotman and mr sinegal have been since fiscal for fiscal mr sinegal received a lower salary than in prior years as a result of stepping down as chief executive officer on december mr jelinek received a base salary of for fiscal cash bonuses have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal mr brotman was awarded a cash bonus of in fiscal while mr jelinek table of contents received a cash bonus of and mr sinegal received amounts that were determined in part according to their length of service in their respective roles during the year the bonus amounts for messrs brotman jelinek and sinegal were determined by the committee as follows half of bonus eligibility was determined by whether the company had achieved its pre tax income goal which was achieved in fiscal eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to these executive officers are described below compensation of other named executive officers as noted above the most significant component of the compensation in fiscal is the award of performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti portera and zook were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr sinegal and were the same amounts as awarded in fiscal as noted above the performance criteria were attained and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service as described above salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels increased up to over fiscal after adjusting for the length of the fiscal years fiscal salaries actually increased up to vs fiscal as a result of the week fiscal as compared to the normal week fiscal year the named executive officers other than messrs brotman sinegal and jelinek received discretionary cash bonuses ranging from approximately to approximately relatively flat as compared to the prior year bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr sinegal after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee of approximately of the targeted amount the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendation but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year as with all other employees roughly of the bonus potential was achieved due to the companys attainment of its internal pre tax income target for fiscal eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the companys pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officers area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a component not linked to any objective measure neither mr sinegal nor mr jelinek is bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors they can and do consider what they believe to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november stock ownership guidelines in fiscal the company adopted stock ownership requirements for executive officers by january all executive officers were required to own and maintain at least shares of common stock all executive officers are in compliance with this requirement table of contents impact of tax considerations the committee examined the equity compensation in light of the impact of section m of the internal revenue code which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of million in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation i e compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders rsus granted to our named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception in approving compensation types and levels the committee considers whether particular elements of that compensation will be deductible for federal income tax purposes it reserves the ability to approve what it believes to be appropriate compensation even if the company may not be able to deduct all of that compensation under federal tax laws conclusion the committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to its shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee of the companys board of directors has submitted the following report for inclusion in this proxy statement the committee has reviewed and discussed with

we are asking for your advisory non binding vote on the following resolution the say on pay resolution resolved that the shareholders approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the companys named executive officers as disclosed in the compensation discussion and table of contents analysis the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure in this proxy statement the board of directors will include say on pay votes in the companys proxy materials annually until the next required shareholder vote on the frequency of such votes the board and the compensation

cause or causes of any significant negative voting results as described in detail under compensation discussion and analysis our compensation programs are designed to motivate our executives to create a successful company if fully earned based on the achievement of performance targets equity compensation in the form of restricted stock units that are subject to further time based vesting is the largest component of executive compensation we believe that our compensation program with its balance of short term incentives including cash bonus awards and performance conditions for awards of restricted stock units and long term incentives including equity awards that vest over up to five years and share ownership guidelines reward sustained performance that is aligned with long term shareholder interests shareholders are encouraged to read the compensation discussion and analysis the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure the board of directors

urging the board of directors to take all necessary steps to eliminate the classification of the board of directors and to require that all directors be elected at each annual meeting following the expiration of the terms in place following the shareholders meeting proposal to repeal classified board resolved that shareholders of costco wholesale corporation urge the board of directors to take all necessary steps other than any steps that must be taken by shareholders to eliminate the classification of the board of directors and to require that all directors elected at or after the annual meeting held in be elected on an annual basis implementation of this proposal should not prevent any director elected prior to the annual meeting held in from completing the term for which such director was elected supporting statement this resolution was submitted on behalf of the pension reserves investment trust fund by its trustee the pension reserves investment management board the shareholder rights project represented and advised the pension reserves investment management board in connection with this resolution table of contents the resolution urges the board of directors to facilitate a declassification of the board such a change would enable shareholders to register their views on the performance of all directors at each annual meeting having directors stand for elections annually makes directors more accountable to shareholders and could thereby contribute to improving performance and increasing firm value according to data from factset research systems the number of sp companies with classified boards declined by more than since and the average percentage of votes cast in favor of shareholder proposals to declassify the boards of sp companies during and exceeded the significant shareholder support for declassification proposals is consistent with empirical studies reporting that classified boards are associated with lower firm valuation bebchuk and cohen confirmed by faleye and frakes takeover targets with classified boards are associated with lower gains to shareholders bebchuk coates and subramanian firms with classified boards are more likely to be associated with value decreasing acquisition decisions masulis wang and xie and classified boards are associated with lower sensitivity of compensation to performance and lower sensitivity of ceo turnover to firm performance faleye although one study bates becher and lemmon reports that classified boards are associated with higher takeover premiums this study also reports that classified boards are associated with a lower likelihood of an acquisition and that classified boards are associated with lower firm valuation please vote for this proposal to make directors more accountable to shareholders board of directors response to proposal your board of directors has given this proposal careful consideration and believes that it should not be implemented the board therefore

acting in the best interests of the company and our shareholders they are required by law to act in accordance with their fiduciary duties regardless of the length of their terms furthering

be a safeguard against a purchaser gaining control of the company without paying fair value because only one third of the directors are elected at any annual meeting a majority of the board cannot be replaced at a single annual meeting a classified board does not preclude a change in control of the company it does provide the board more time and flexibility to evaluate the adequacy and fairness of proposed offers implement the optimum method of enhancing shareholder value protect shareholders against abusive tactics during a takeover process and negotiate the best terms for all shareholders without the threat of imminent removal of a majority of board members elimination of the classified board structure would reduce the boards power to deal with proposals it believes are unfair or inadequate approval process shareholder approval of this proposal would not itself declassify the board to change the classified structure the board must authorize amendments to the companys governance documents shareholders would then have to approve each of those amendments with an affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the
