the board has determined that mr munger is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission sec in order to ensure continuing auditor independence the audit committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the external auditors in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the external auditor s lead engagement partner the audit committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner the audit committee met seventimes during fiscal a report of the audit committee is set forth below compensation committee the compensation committees function is to review the salaries bonuses and stock based compensation provided to executive officers of the company and to oversee the overall administration of the companys compensation and stock based compensation programs except with respect to setting the compensation of the chief executive officer the committee may delegate its authority to a subcommittee of the committee consisting either of a subset of members of the committee or any members of the board who would be eligible to serve on the committee in addition to the extent permitted by applicable law the committee may delegate to one or more executive officers of the company the authority to grant stock awards to employees who are not executive officers or members of the board the committee has delegated certain authority to the chief executive officer and chairman of the board with respect to such awards not involving executive officers see compensation discussion and analysis below for a further description of the role of the committee the members of the committee are mr munger and ms ruckelshaus and it met twotimes during fiscal a report of the compensation committee is set forth below nominating and governance committee the functions of the nominating and governance committee are to identify and approve individuals qualified to serve as members of the board select director nominees for the annual meeting of shareholders evaluate the boards performance develop and recommend to the board corporate governance guidelines and provide oversight with respect to corporate governance and ethical conduct the members of the committee are messrs raikes chair and evans and ms ruckelshaus the committee is authorized by its charter to engage its own advisors the committee approved the nomination of the candidates reflected in proposal the board is responsible for nominating members for election to the board and for filling vacancies on the board that may occur between annual meetings of shareholders the committee is responsible for identifying screening and recommending to the board candidates for board membership when formulating its recommendations the committee will also consider advice and recommendations from others as it deems appropriate the committee met threetimes in fiscal the committee will consider shareholder recommendations for candidates to serve on the board in accordance with our bylaws the name of any recommended candidate together with pertinent biographical information a document indicating the candidates willingness to serve if elected and evidence of the nominating shareholders ownership of company stock should be sent to the secretary of the company the company may require additional information as described in our bylaws our corporate governance guidelines provide that nominees for director will be selected on the basis of among other things knowledge experience skills expertise integrity diversity ability to make independent analytical inquiries and understanding of the companys business environment all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the board at the time nominees should also be willing to devote adequate time and effort to board responsibilities the nominating and governance committee does not set specific minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the board but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merit taking into account the needs of the company and the composition of the board we believe that the company benefits from having directors with a diversity of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences currently of the fourteen directors on the board three are women in addition as discussed above our directors bring a diversity of viewpoints and experiences as established leaders in important areas of business academia government service and other public and non profit service that we believe strengthens the boards ability to guide our company pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines the nominating and governance committee oversees a self assessment of the boards performance every year the assessment seeks to identify specific areas if any in need of improvement or strengthening including with respect to the diversity of our board in terms of viewpoints backgrounds and experiences formal nomination of candidates by shareholders requires compliance with section of the bylaws there is otherwise no formal process prescribed for identifying and evaluating nominees except as described in the corporate governance guidelines corporate governance guidelines the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines which may be viewed at www costco com through the investor relations page during the fiscal year the guidelines were amended to change the frequency of the board self evaluation process to annually more recently the guidelines were amended to enhance the commitment to consideration of diversity in the processes for identifying and nominating directors board structure the corporate governance guidelines provide that the board does not require the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer and shall be free to choose its chairman in any way that it deems best for the company at any given point in time currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately the board believes that this structure is appropriate for the company at this time as a co founder of the company mr brotman has played a critical role in the growth of the company and his role as chairman is complemented by the role of mr jelinek as president and chief executive officer and a more active participant in day to day management of the company in addition the board believes that it obtains effective additional board leadership through the role of the lead independent director currently filled by mr james the lead independent director presides over executive sessions of the board and otherwise facilitates communication among senior management and the non employee directors the role of the board in risk oversight one board function is to oversee the ways in which management deals with risk the board seeks to ensure that management has in place processes for dealing appropriately with risk it is the responsibility of the companys senior management to develop and implement the companys short and long term objectives and to identify evaluate manage and mitigate the risks inherent in seeking to achieve those objectives management is responsible for identifying risk and risk controls related to significant business activities and company objectives and developing programs to determine the sufficiency of risk identification the balance of potential risk to potential reward the appropriate manner in which to control risk and the support of the risk controlling behavior and the risk to company strategy the board implements its risk oversight responsibilities primarily through the audit committee which receives management reports on the potentially significant risks that the company faces and how the company is seeking to control risk where appropriate and oversees internal control over financial reporting in more limited cases such as with risks of significant new business concepts and substantial entry into new markets risk oversight is addressed as part of the full boards engagement with the chief executive officer and management board members also often discuss risk as a part of their review of the ongoing business financial and other activities of the company the board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning the nominating and governance committee also exercises oversight regarding risks associated with corporate governance matters and certain issues relating to the companys ethics and compliance programs compensation of directorseach non employee director earns per year for serving on the board and for each

the growth of our business the company believes it has been very successful in attracting and retaining quality employees achieving low turnover in our executive staff and warehouse management ranks in addition in the judgment of the compensation committee the programs have contributed to the financial and competitive success of the company accordingly the committee believes it is desirable to continue these programs at the annual meeting the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation was in favor the committee did not determine to make any changes to the compensation programs as a result of the vote compensation levels approved by the committee for the named executive officers for fiscal are not materially changed from those approved for the prior year discussions by certain directors and management with a number of shareholders since the annual meeting have not revealed concerns about the structure or operation of the company s compensation programs role of the compensation committeethe committee determines the amounts and elements of compensation for our chief executive officer and chairman for other executive officers it reviews the recommendations of the chief executive officer with which it generally agrees the committees function is more fully described above under committees of the board compensation committee during fiscal the committee consisted of dr carson chair until may mr munger and ms ruckelshaus the committee has authority under its charter to engage compensation consultants but has not used any the committees primary activity occurs in the fall following the close of the fiscal year when the committee i approves grants of rsus including performance targets for rsus granted to executive officers for the current fiscal year ii determines whether performance targets have been satisfied for rsus granted during the prior fiscal year iii approves total compensation levels for executive officers for the fiscal year just concluded including any salary increases and cash bonuses and iv approves the executive officer cash bonus plan for the current fiscal year elements of compensationthe components of our executive compensation programs are equity compensation since fiscal consisting solely of rsus and since fiscal solely of performance based rsus base salary cash bonuses and other benefits primarily consisting of health plans a k plan and a deferred compensation plan and perquisites the committee believes that these components are appropriate and are consistent with the companys long standing approach to executive compensation which has made equity awards the dominant form of compensation the committee did not reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity salary bonus and other compensation components for each executive officer rather it relied upon the fact that the current structure has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages performance based rsus performance based rsu grants represent the largest component of compensation based on their fair value at the time they are granted the committee believes that emphasizing this form of compensation helps to align the interests of employee grantees with those of shareholders both in the shorter term with the one year performance conditions and in the longer term with time based vesting of up to five years subject to earlier vesting for long service as described below to a lesser extent the committee also takes into account that longer term vesting requirements can help promote executive retention the committee s view is that the general five year vesting period and the stock ownership requirement provide a significant long term dimension to the equity awards base salary base salary is the second largest compensation component it is consistent with the need for executive officers to have predictable cash compensation which has been subject generally to modest annual increases cash bonus cash bonuses are a relatively small component of compensation and subject to caps are awarded at the discretion of the committee based on a variety of metrics they address short term incentives and are linked to performance during the fiscal year historically at least some portion of the cash bonuses has been paid each year the committee believes that maintaining cash bonuses as a modest element of compensation is consistent with preferring long term equity incentives as being in the greater interest of the company and its shareholders executive base salaries and cash bonuses are in the committees view low compared to the other companies in our peer group described below under peer companies other elements and perquisites consistent with its position as a low overhead operator the company has modest perquisites and other compensation a significant component of this compensation is related to helping executives fund their retirement needs through the k plan and the deferred compensation plan the foregoing components of compensation combine a mix of incentives that are intended to create rewards for shorter term twelve months and longer term performance five years and beyond shorter term incentives come primarily from the initial award of rsus being subject to achievement of a one year performance metric and to a significantly lesser extent cash bonuses that are subject to a mix of one year performance metrics longer term incentives come primarily from the rsu award vesting of up to five years and to a lesser extent share ownership requirements for executive officers and vesting elements in certain benefit plans such as the deferred compensation plan and k retirement plan matches the committee believes that these elements do not promote unreasonable risk taking behavior the value of shorter term incentives including cash bonus awards with caps and performance conditions for awards of rsus is substantially exceeded by longer term incentives including equity awards that vest up to five years and share ownership requirements which the committee believes reward sustained performance that is aligned with shareholder interests during fiscal moreover the board revised the companys corporate governance guidelines to include a claw back provision giving the committee the power to require the return of incentive compensation that has been earned by improper means peer companiesfor fiscal the committee considered executive compensation data obtained from proxy statements for the following peer companies wal mart stores inc the home depot inc target corporation the kroger company and lowes companies this peer group is the same group as was used for fiscal these companies were selected because they are recognized as successful retailers and one of them represents the other major membership warehouse operator that is publicly traded in utilizing the comparative data the committee took into account that one of the companies is substantially larger than the company the committee did not use the comparable company data to set mid points or other specific quantitative comparisons of executive compensation it used them only for general reference equity compensationif fully earned based upon the achievement of performance targets and fully vested equity compensation is the largest component of compensation for executive officers rsu grants to all executive officers are performance based with performance vesting over a one year period time vesting over five years and vesting for long service contingent upon the executives maintaining employment status at the vest date the board and the committee believe that the five year vesting requirement helps to foster motivation over the longer term following satisfaction of performance targets rsus become time vested rsus that subject to accelerated vesting for long service described below vest upon the first anniversary of the grant date following the determination by the committee that the performance criteria have been satisfied and vest over each of the ensuing four years vesting of rsus awarded to non executive officers and employees is not performance based to the extent time vesting requirements are met rsus are settled and paid in shares of common stock net of shares withheld for minimum statutory withholding taxes recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered rsus all officers and employees who receive rsu grants receive accelerated vesting prior to termination if they have achieved long service with the company vesting credited on the first anniversary of the date of grant after years of service vesting after years of service and vesting after years of service with any remainder vesting ratably over the remaining vesting period this accelerated vesting entitles officers and employees to receive shares within ten business days of the anniversary of the grant date or of the initial grant date if the years of service requirement has been met prior to the grant date the criteria for the fiscal performance based grants were a increase versus fiscal of total sales or a increase in pre tax income with both measures based on local currencies after the end of fiscal the committee determined that both goals were exceeded accordingly the executive officers earned all of the rsus granted subject to time based and long service vesting all executive officers received accelerated vesting for long service for a portion of these rsus with a further time based vesting occurring on the first anniversary of the grant the board adopted in july a fixed date of october for rsu grants the policy allows for exceptions as approved in advance by the committee for fiscal rsu grants were made on october and the performance criteria for the grants were established in november all rsu awards in fiscal were made under the companys sixth restated stock incentive plan approved by the companys shareholders and as amended in january as the seventh restated incentive plan the only equity plan maintained by the company other compensationthe company provides the named executive officers with benefits of a type offered to all other employees in most respects the cost of these benefits constitutes a small percentage of each executives total compensation key benefits include paid vacation premiums paid for long term disability insurance a matching contribution and a discretionary k plan contribution and the payment of premiums for health insurance and basic life insurance in addition the company has a non qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated employees including the named executive officers the plan provides that the first of an employees contributions maybe matched by the company subject to certain limitations this match will vest over a specified period of time the company does not maintain a pension plan or post retirement medical plan for any named executive officer the company also provides the named executive officers with certain perquisites including a car allowance there is a company match for certain charitable contributions the committee believes the benefits and perquisites are modest and consistent with its overall objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executive officers compensation of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the boardin addition to considering the companys compensation policies generally the committee reviews executive compensation and concentrates on the compensation packages for the chief executive officer and the chairman believing that these roles are particularly critical to the continued success of the company near the beginning of fiscal the committee approved a written employment contract for mr jelinek related to service during fiscal as chief executive officer the agreement provided for an annual base salary of up from the prior year the agreement further provided for a cash bonus of up to unchanged from the prior year determined by the board or the committee and an rsu award determined by the board or the committee mr brotman who is an executive chairman does not have an employment agreement his salary in fiscal was unchanged at mr brotman received a pay increase in fiscal to bring his salary in line with other executive officers prior to that increase he had not received a salary increase since apart from the change in control provision in the companys equity plan applicable to all grantees described below under potential payments upon termination or change in control neither mr brotman nor mr jelinek nor any other employee has any change in control arrangement with the company for fiscal the committee granted performance based rsus to mr brotman and mr jelinek the committee determined after the end of the fiscal year that the performance criteria were exceeded and all of the rsus were earned subject to further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service cash bonuses for the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board have generally been capped at no more than since fiscal for fiscal mr brotman and mr jelinek each earned a cash bonus of the bonus amounts for messrs brotman and jelinek were determined by the committee as follows i up to one half of bonus eligibility was determined by the company s progress toward its pre tax income goal which was achieved in fiscal and ii eligibility for the remaining half was determined by applying a percentage representing the amount of bonus received by other executive officers in comparison to their bonus eligibility approximately the criteria governing bonuses to these executive officers are described below compensation of other named executive officersthe most significant component of the compensation in fiscal was the award of performance based rsus rsu amounts awarded to messrs galanti portera and zook were each the amounts awarded were based on the recommendations of mr jelinek as noted above the performance criteria were exceeded and the named executive officers earned all of the rsus granted with further time vesting and accelerated vesting for long service salaries for other named executive officers were based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek who focused on the amount of increase deserved over the prior years salary level base salary levels for these officers increased up to over fiscal the named executive officers other than messrs brotman and jelinek received cash bonuses ranging from approximately to greater than the prior year range as a result of the company s having met the pre tax income goal for fiscal bonus criteria were approved by the committee in early fiscal based upon the recommendation of mr jelinek after the close of the fiscal year mr jelinek recommended bonus amounts to the committee for most of the named executive officers of approximately of the eligible amounts up to as with other bonus eligible employees of the bonus potential was achieved due to the company s attainment of its internal pre tax income target for fiscal that target was billion a increase from fiscal pre tax income on a generally accepted accounting principles basis of the target was achieved actual pretax income was billion based on mr jelinek s recommendation the committee determined to award of the potential bonus eligibility for the bonus portion not associated with the company s pre tax income target was determined based on goals relevant to the executive officer s area of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are operational the goals related to sales controllable expenses inventory shrinkage and pre tax profit in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities are primarily buying the goals related to sales gross margin inventory shrinkage and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions the goals related to a combination of those described above and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions the goals related to a combination of company wide operational and buying goals in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas of responsibility for each officer there is also a small component approximately of total bonus eligibility based on the discretion of mr jelinek mr jelinek is not bound to recommend any specific bonus amount based on these factors he considers what he believes to be the appropriate bonus in view of all the circumstances subject to the caps noted above the committee maintains the discretion to vary from the chief executive officers recommendations but historically has deferred to it as it did this fiscal year to be eligible for the annual bonus the individual must be employed by the company and in the same or similar executive level position at the time bonus checks are issued historically in november clawback policyin fiscal the company adopted a policy under which the company will seek to recover at the direction of the committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so incentive compensation including bonus incentive payment and equity award awarded or paid to an officer for a fiscal period if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment where the incentive compensation is not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis the committee may determine in its discretion the amount if any by which the payment or award should be reduced in addition if an officer engaged in intentional misconduct as determined by the committee in its sole discretion that contributed to the award or payment of incentive compensation to the officer that is greater than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the misconduct the company may take other remedial and recovery action as determined by the committee stock ownership requirementsall executive officers are required to and do own and maintain at least shares of common stock hedging and pledging policyin fiscal the board revised the corporate governance guidelines to prohibit transactions involving hedging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of the board and to prohibit pledging of company shares by directors and executive officers without the approval of a designated trading compliance committee which would review any risks of proposed transactions impact of tax considerationsthe committee examined compensation in light of the impact of section m of the internal revenue code of as amended which generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of one million dollars in any taxable year to the named executive officers other than the chief financial officer subject to certain exceptions for performance based compensation paid only if an individual satisfies objective performance goals that the committee has established in advance based on performance criteria approved by shareholders performance based rsus granted to named executive officers are intended to satisfy the performance based exception the committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service conclusionthe committee believes that each element of compensation and the total compensation provided to each of the named executive officers is reasonable and appropriate the value of the compensation payable to the named executive officers is significantly tied to the companys performance and the return to shareholders the committee believes that its compensation programs will allow the company to continue to attract and retain a top performing management team report of the compensation committee of the board of directorsthe compensation committee of the companys board of directors has submitted the

markets and corporate boardrooms with little cost or disruption has the potential to enhance board performance raising us market capitalization by up to billionenhance shareholder value vote for proxy access for shareholders proposal board of directors responserecommendation of the board of directors on proposal the board of directors does not oppose proxy access in principle the current proposal however contains features as discussed below that are not in alignment with the limited adoptions of proxy access that have occurred in the united states thus far or the companys specific attributes track record and governance the board believes that implementation of proxy access should be developed in a deliberate methodical fashion that involves further engagement with shareholders a review of continuing marketplace developments and consideration of intended and potentially unintended consequences accordingly the nominating and governance committee of the board will consider these and other factors and recommend a form of access suitable for the company following that recommendation the board intends to adopt or propose a form of proxy access appropriate for the company and its shareholders by the annual meeting in the meantime the board continues to be open to receiving input from shareholders regarding board composition governance practices and value creation opportunities in light of these factors the board believes that proxy access in the form of proposal is not in the best interests of our shareholders and recommends that you vote against it the specific terms of this proposal are problematic the board believes that the proxy access framework advocated in the proposal fails to provide the appropriate balance and safeguards to prevent proxy contests that would be highly disruptive distracting management and the board from the core business the proposal contemplates a percentage of the board being available for proxy access candidates that is unacceptably high and not in accordance with market trends the proposal could require the company to include any qualifying shareholders nominees in the companys proxy statement regardless of whether the shareholders intend to file their own proxy statement and engage in a proxy contest the proposal does not require shareholder nominees to be independent or to satisfy applicable law and fails to require that shareholder nominees have no affiliations with a competitor or others who oppose the companys best interests the burden of proxy contests against director candidates who if elected could cause the company to be out of compliance with independence requirements and to violate the law could harm shareholders the proposal does not require nominating shareholders to have held and retain voting and investment power of the shares used to establish eligibility to nominate a director under the proposal a shareholder could have a net short position in the companys stock and still be entitled to make a nomination the proposal does not require nominating shareholders to certify that they are not seeking to effect a change in control of the company proxy access is intended to give shareholders an opportunity to have their nominees for election included in the companys proxy materials it should not be used as a mechanism for taking control of the board under circumstances where shareholders are not appropriately compensated for surrendering that control the proposal does not require nominating shareholders to retain ownership of their shares through the meeting date so a nominating shareholder could sell all of its shares prior to the meeting date which would misalign the interests of the nominating shareholder and company shareholders the proposal does not cap the number of shareholders that could constitute a group for purposes of the threshold which could allow hundreds of shareholders to act together and administratively burden the company the board believes that the failure of the proposal to provide these safeguards could result in proxy access nominations being used or threatened in a manner that would be harmful to the company and our shareholders the proposal fails to recognize the companys existing governance practices that reinforce the boards alignment with and accountability to shareholders the proposal does not articulate any specific concerns regarding our governance or performance and does not take into account the boards actions to develop corporate governance policies that serve to promote responsiveness to shareholders shareholders are able to communicate directly with the board on relevant topics including board composition and performance shareholders may submit for consideration names of potential director candidates directly to the nominating and governance committee under existing sec rules and state law shareholders can directly nominate and solicit proxies for their own director candidates at shareholder meetings shareholders may call special meetings at which they can nominate director candidates or propose other business to enhance their alignment with the interests of shareholders our independent directors compensation consists primarily of restricted stock unit awards that vest over a three year period and the directors must maintain a specified level of stock ownership the board has overseen superior performance and returns to shareholders by the company while maintaining modest levels of executive compensation and market leading compensation for the workforce at our membership warehouses we maintain an open director nomination process accessible to all shareholders our shareholders have consistently elected directors nominated by our board and have not found it necessary to advance opposing candidates in elections or even advance candidates for consideration by the nominating and governance committee the proposal fails to recognize how the companys nomination procedure serves the interests of the company and its shareholders the board actively reviews and refreshes its membership led by the independent directors of the nominating and governance committee the board has been actively engaged in a board refreshment program to nominate independent directors who meet the evolving needs of the company which has resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors in the nominating and governance committee evaluates the board and in making decisions on the boards composition considers tenure performance contributions experience skill set and commitment new directors have been added to the board as the companys operations have evolved and diversified while we have also retained directors with extensive knowledge of the companys background executives business models and performance as a result of these processes the board effectively oversees our management and operations and has guided our company to the long term success and benefit of our shareholders over the long term costco wholesale has consistently outperformed the nasdaq composite producing higher returns in the past three five and ten year periods the proposal could undermine costcos long term approach to creating shareholder value implementation of proxy access on the terms of the proposal could threaten the long term focus that has traditionally characterized the companys relationship with its customers employees and suppliers to the detriment of operations performance and returns to shareholders costcos long term approach to creating shareholder value has resulted in consistent long term growth in the financial and operating performance of the company and returns to shareholders the following table shows the companys superior performance in generating total shareholder return including share price appreciation and dividends the board believes that continuity among directors has played a significant role in producing these returns adoption of proxy access in the form proposed could discourage qualified individuals from agreeing to serve on the companys board a decision to implement a form of proxy access should be made in a careful manner only after a demonstration that it will enhance shareholder value and does not create risks that are disproportionate although some companies have adopted proxy access there continues to be a variety of viewpoints among investors and commentators about the value of proxy access in creating shareholder value and about how it should be structured in addition proxy access remains untried in execution in the united states directors who have the option to serve on multiple boards might choose a company that will not present the burdens and uncertainties associated with potentially contested elections under proxy access input from shareholders as part of a process of engagement among the board of directors management and certain shareholders including most of the companys ten largest shareholders discussions were held concerning among other things proxy access those discussions revealed a lack of unanimity among these shareholders concerning whether or not proxy access should be adopted at all and if it were to be adopted what the features should be the board recognizes that the ability to elect directors is a fundamental right the companys existing corporate governance practices empower shareholders and protect that right the board intends over the coming year to continue to monitor developments on proxy access and the company will continue to discuss proxy access developments with its shareholders as part of its regular engagement program the board intends to adopt or propose a form of proxy access by the annual meeting the interval will be used to evaluate the vote on the shareholder proposal seek additional feedback from shareholders and observe other developments concerning proxy access during including the form in which it may be adopted by other companies in the meantime shareholders who hold views on whether a specific nominee or nominees should be included in the proxy statement for the annual meeting are encouraged to use existing mechanisms to provide input to the nominating and governance committee and the board the board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote against proposal other mattersneither the board nor management intends to bring before the annual meeting any business other than the matters referred to in the notice of meeting and this proxy statement if any other business should properly
