accordingly this amendment should be read in conjunction with the form k part iiitem managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data overviewwe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth particularly comparable sales growth we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year including remodels relocations and expansions as well as online salesrelated to websites operating for more than one year comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting our u s and canadian operations the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expenses reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business especially the united states sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across a wide range of global national and regional wholesalers and retailers while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label items our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values our investments in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members all negatively impacting near term gross margin as a percentage of net sales gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non gasoline business a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near term net sales growth generally rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued which given the higher sales base negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses as our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth the negative aspects of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets and we expect that to continue our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase penetration of our executive members and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically some significant costs are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expenses with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits rather we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause us for example to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces because our business is operated on very low margins modest changes in various items in the income statement particularly merchandise costs and selling general and administrative expenses can have substantial impacts on net income our operating model is generally the same across our u s canada and other international operating segments see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales and or less or no direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lower margin gasoline business in all countries except mexico korea and taiwan in discussions of our consolidated operating results we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u s dollar which are references to the differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u s dollars for financial reporting purposes this impact of foreign exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period s currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period s average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august fiscal years and were week fiscal years ending on august august and august respectively certain percentages

included in the table above and discussed in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition merchandise inventory valuation impairment of long lived assets insurance self insurance liabilities and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these statements for further information on significant accounting policies see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report revenue recognitionwe generally recognize sales which include shipping fees where applicable net of returns at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services when we collect payment from members prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services the amount is generally item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs accordingly our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount generally when we are the primary obligor subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers influence product or service specifications or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above we record a net amount which is reflected in net sales we record related shipping fees on a gross basis we account for membership fee revenue net of refunds on a deferred basis whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one year our executive members qualify for a reward on qualified purchases up to a maximum reward of approximately per year in the u s and canada and varies in our other international operations which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses we account for this reward as a reduction in sales the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data merchandise inventoriesmerchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method and are stated using the last in first out lifo method for substantially all u s merchandise inventories merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in first out fifo method we record an adjustment each quarter if necessary for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales the provision is adjusted to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year inventory cost where appropriate is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones terms of agreement or other systematic approaches impairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis when relocating or closing a facility or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group generally an individual warehouse may not be fully recoverable our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair value insurance self insurance liabilitieswe use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms including for certain risks a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation general liability property damage directors and officers liability vehicle liability and employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued income taxesthe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities when facts and circumstances change we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate additionally our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested as of august these earnings would be subject to u s income tax if we changed our position and could result in a u s deferred tax liability although we have historically asserted that certain non u s undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested we may repatriate such earnings to the extent we can do so without an adverse tax consequence recent accounting pronouncementssee
