under u s generally accepted accounting principles u s gaap fully benefit responsive investment contracts are reported at contract value see note while all other investmentsin the planare reported table of contentscostco k retirement plannotes to financial statements continued december and at fair value see note a benefit responsive investment contract is a contract with a financial institution or an insurance company that provides for a stated return on principal invested over a specified period and that permits withdrawals at contract value for benefit payments loans or transfers to other investment options offered to the participant by the plan contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan b use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with u s gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions c investment valuation and income recognitionthe plan invests in the companys common stock common commingled trust funds and other exchange traded equity securities held in the separately managed accounts as well as registered investment companies and certain fully benefit responsive investment contracts that in turn invest in a combination of stocks bonds and other investment securities investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur and that those changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits registered investment company funds company common stock and other equity securities held in the separately managed accounts are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices the cpp is invested in sics and sacs which are fully benefit responsive and recorded at contract value participant withdrawals are required to be at contract value there are no reserves against contract value for credit risk of the contract issuer or otherwise the crediting interest rate is based on a formula agreed upon with the issuer but may not be less than zero such interest rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for resetting certain events may limit the ability of the plan to transact at contract value with the issuer events may include but are not limited to plan termination bankruptcy of the company or defunction of the trustee a result may be that the fully benefit responsive contracts are terminated and settled at a valued amount different from the contract value the plan administrator believes at this time any events that would limit the plans ability to transact at contract value with participants are not probable purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis interest income is recorded on an accrual basis dividends are recorded on the ex dividend date net appreciation or depreciation of investments includes the change in the fair

value measurementu s gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs the three levels of inputs are level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data the following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value level primarily consists of financial instruments such as investments in registered investment company funds and the company s common stock whose value is based on quoted market prices such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market exchange traded instruments and listed equities level includes assets and liabilities where quoted market prices are unobservable but observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities valuation methodologies are based on consensus pricing using market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers or pricing that considers various assumptions including time value yield curve volatility factors credit spreads default rates loss severity current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt broker and dealer quotes as well as other relevant economic measures all are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for which the plan typically receives independent external valuation information table of contentscostco k retirement plannotes to financial statements continued december and level assets include significant unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants the plan uses the income approach for certain investments which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies or replacement cost for level assets valuation techniques utilized during the reporting period in the fair value measurement of level level and level assets and liabilities presented on the plans statements of net assets available for benefits were not changed from previous practice the plan reports transfers in and out of levels and as applicable using the fair value of the individual securities or funds as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer s occurred the carrying value of the plans receivables approximate fair value due to their short term nature or fixed rates relative to prevailing market rates assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value common stock registered investment company funds and separately managed accounts valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded these assets are valued using level inputs common commingled trust valued at the net asset value nav of shares held by the plan at year end plan participant transactions of investment or withdrawals may occur on a daily basis in these trusts there are no unfunded commitments at december or accounting standards update asu technical corrections and improvements updated the definition of readily determinable fair value the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of common commingled trust funds are based on quoted market prices such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market as such the plan has changed its valuation technique of the common commingled trust from nav practical expedient to nav readily determinable fair value for and this did not have a material impact to the financial

termination participants will become vested in their accounts tax statusin a determination letter dated september the irs informed the company that the plan is designed in accordance with applicable sections of the irc although the plan has been amended since receiving the last determination letter the plan administrator believes that the plan is designed and is being operated in compliance with the requirements of the irc u s gaap requires plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the plan and recognize a tax liability or asset if the plan has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the irs the plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability or asset or disclosure in the financial statements the plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions there are currently no audits in progress the plan administrator believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to party in interest and related party transactionscertain
