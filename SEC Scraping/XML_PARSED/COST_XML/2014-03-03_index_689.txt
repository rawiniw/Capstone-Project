the letter please see the discussion below which corresponds to the numbered paragraphs in your letter form k for the fiscal year ended september results of operations page membership fees page we note your response to comment of our letter dated january as it relates to inclusion of the cost of the reward program in net sales please quantify the rewards discount included in net sales in future discussion and analysis of net sales response we disclosed in our form k the executive rewards discount deducted from net sales in our revenue recognition policy contained in item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies the reductions in sales for the reward disclosed were million million and million in and respectively representing less than of consolidatednet sales because the changes in these amounts and the absolute amounts were immaterial to the analysis of net sales they were not separately discussed in managements discussion and analysis to the extent changes in these reductions were to be material to the overall change in sales in future periods we will include commentary in our discussion and analysis of net sales vs page we note your response to comment of our letter dated january in future filings please elaborate to describe in further detail what you mean by investment in merchandise pricing response in future filings we will update our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview section of our form q and k to the following effect as might be applicable our investments in merchandise pricing include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionmarch selling general and administrative expenses page we note your response to comment of our letter dated january that a substantial portion of your sga is attributable to payroll and benefits for warehouse employees credit card processing bank charges and utilities while there may be some correlation between such items and the volume of sales your relative discussion of sga fails to capture increases in sga that are not volume related such as salary and benefit increases for existing workforce and changes in non warehouse employees changes in other items of overhead and fluctuations due to changes in energy prices while your existing discussion of sga relative to sales is informative we believe it would be more transparent to also discuss those items that do not exactly correlate with the volume of sales to the same extent as cost of sales please revise in future filings with respect to your credit card processing and bank charges please explain to us in detail your arrangement with american express as it relates to the merchant discount fee structure please also advise whether costco issued amex cards that generate rewards are subject to the same merchant discount as non proprietary cards and how the merchant discount is classified please also tell us how the cash back feature of these cards are recognized measured and classified in your financial statements response in our discussion and analysis we focus on results as seen through the eyes of those who manage our business as management we analyze our selling general and administrative expense sga as a percentage of sales we believe that our historical sga discussion which has followed this approach has been transparent and informative our disclosure see examples below includes both material components of sga in addition to unusual or non recurring charges in the current period which may only be one or two basis points as a percentage change in our net sales but we deem these charges important to discuss so that investors understand the overall changes in our sga costs examples of these disclosures in our past filings include vs sga expenses as a percent of net sales increased seventeen basis points compared to the first quarter of excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales sga expenses increased seven basis points this increase driven by higher stock compensation expense of five basis points resulting primarily from appreciation in the trading price of the company s common stock occurred despite a reduction in the average number of rsus granted to each participant during the quarter vs sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved basis points compared to excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation sga expenses improvednine basis points primarily due to an eleven basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by contributions to an initiative reforming alcohol beverage laws in washington state and higher stock compensation expense which had negative impacts of two basis points each higher costs related to the modernization of our information systems and related activities which includes the re platforming of our e commerce sites also adversely impacted our sga percentage vs sga expenses as a percent of net sales improved basis points in compared to excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation sga expenses improved basis points primarily due to a basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs largely payroll this improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of or three basis points recorded in fiscal related to the refund of a previously recorded canadian employee tax liability interpretation commission guidance regarding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities and exchange commission cfr parts and release nos fr james allegretto senior assistant chief accountantunited states securities and exchange commissionmarch in addition to being granular these disclosures generally make self evident whether the particular expense for which a change has been highlighted is one that would be expected to vary with sales as it happens the changes highlighted recently have generally been of the type not varying substantially with the level of sales we believe further discussion in absolute dollar changes beyond what we have historically disclosed would not be beneficial to our investors nor provide them with meaningful information to further understand our results we have a card acceptance agreement with american express amex for the acceptance of all amex branded cards which would include the costco co branded amex card the contractual merchant discount rate applies to all amex cards accepted and the resulting fees are recorded in our sga in addition to the card acceptance agreement we have a co branded card program co branded agreement agreement with amex to issue the costco co branded card to engage in joint promotional efforts and to receive rebates and other pay for performance incentives we account for the co branded agreement following the guidance in asc subtopic revenue customer payments and incentives certain rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to sga offsetting specific incremental expenses incurred by the company with the remainder accounted for as revenue and included in net sales where we have determined that amex has received an identifiable benefit the reward earned by our members from use of the co branded card is delivered to our members by amex in the form of a reward certificate we accept these certificates as a form of payment from our members and receive reimbursement from amex for certificates redeemed there is no impact to our consolidated statements of operations for these rewards earned by members there is therefore no basis for discussing separately these issuances or redemptions in our financial statements stock repurchase programs page we note your response to comment of our letter dated january in future filings please revise your stock repurchase program accounting policy footnote on page to indicate how you allocate the cost of the repurchased shares to apic and retained earnings in this regard please disclose the method used such as average cost or specific identification refer to asc and asc a response in future filings we will expand our stock repurchase program accounting policy disclosure to the following effect repurchased shares of common stock are retired in accordance with the washington business corporation act the par value of repurchased shares is first deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is then deducted by allocation to both additional paid in capital and retained earnings the amount allocated to additional paid in capital is calculated as the current value of additional paid in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings please contact me if you have any questions or further comments sincerely costco wholesale corporation s richarda galantirichard a
