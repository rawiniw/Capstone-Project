compensation arrangements this compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months and has a weighted average recognition period of years note income taxes our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income for example the impact of discrete items and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit reduce our pre tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate during q we recognized an income tax benefit of million which includes million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in january table of contents cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was million and million in q and q as of march and december gross unrecognized tax benefits tax contingencies were million and million we expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in in addition changes in state federal and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued it is reasonably possible that within the next months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings we are under examination or may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for the calendar year or thereafter these examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses as previously disclosed we have received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs for the and calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the irs is seeking to increase our u s taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax over a seven year period beginning in totaling approximately billion subject to interest to date we have not resolved this matter administratively and in december we petitioned the u s tax court to resolve the matter we continue to disagree with these irs positions and intend to vigorously contest them certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the french tax administration fta for calendar year or thereafter these examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes while we have not yet received a final assessment from the fta in september we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years through relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions the notices propose additional french tax of approximately million including interest and penalties through the date of the assessment we disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it we plan to pursue all available administrative remedies at the fta and if we are not able to resolve this matter with the fta we plan to pursue judicial remedies we are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including china germany japan luxembourg and the united kingdom we are or may be subject to examination by these particular tax authorities for the calendar year and thereafter note segment information we have organized our

differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in item a of partii risk factors for additional information see item of part ii managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our annual report on form k critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companysfinancial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note description of business and accounting policies of our annual report on form k and item of part i financial statements note accounting policies of this form q although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions inventories inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance at march we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately million goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any table of contents during the quarter management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged decrease from our march closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately million impact on our q operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at march and december were we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for recognizing compensation expense for example over of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions including integrations and investments by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations with a number of countries actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods recent accounting pronouncements see item of part i financial statements note accounting policies recent

interest payments on our long term obligations cash received from our consumer seller and enterprise customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended march compared to the comparable prior year

securities purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant non inventory commitments were billion at march purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancelable in full or in part through the contractual provisions because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was for q and q we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by other sellers our continuing focus onin stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item a of part ii risk factors we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all the operating cycle is number of days of sales in inventory plus number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days

shipping methods and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing placement of fulfillment centers negotiating

shipping charges to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increased product digital content and shipping costs resulting from increased sales as well as from expansion of digital offerings consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented were as follows threemonthsended march gross profit in millions gross margin gross margin increased in q compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to services sales increasing as a percentage of total sales we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services table of contents fulfillment fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and services sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we evaluate our facility requirements as necessary marketing we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels such as our sponsored search programs and our associates program payroll and related expenses and television advertising while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely technology and content we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as technology infrastructure including aws digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing physical and digital product categories and offerings so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses including those associated with our digital initiatives and increased spending on technology infrastructure including aws we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in these areas by increasing payroll and related expenses and adding technology infrastructure see item of part ii managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our annual report on form k

securities and aaa rated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds and the prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the

currency gains losses on intercompany balances income taxes our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income for example the impact of discrete items and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit reduce our pre tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate during q we recognized an income tax benefit of million which includes million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and

consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non gaap financial measures free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating activities is cash flow from operations reduced by purchases of property and equipment including internal use software and website development we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment including internal use software and website development are a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt obligations related to capital leases and leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows

based compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrally incurred operating costs stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements operating expenses without stock based compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation our cash salary

flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks we face intense competition our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail e commerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the u s or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive websites products services price decreases or improvements changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet e commerce digital media devices and web services including outside the u s timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure table of contents the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer free shipping continue to reduce product prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies the extent to which our equity method investees record significant operating and non operating items the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and terrorist attacks and armed hostilities we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation of e commerce other online services and electronic devices and competition and restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payments and restrictions on pricing or discounts lower levels of use of the internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the u s lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employee employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions laws and policies of the u s and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and geopolitical events including war and terrorism table of contents as international e commerce and other online services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth the peoples republic of china prc regulates amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in the prc through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet it infrastructure retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements www amazon cn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals although we believe these structures comply with existing prc laws they involve unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if our chinese business interests were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition the chinese businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for drop shipping we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors third parties either drop ship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades split shipments and additional long zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances table of contents our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships we provide e commerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of third party software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales therefore if the other companys offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results our present and future e commerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible assets such as inventory and intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other than temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results table of contents we have foreign exchange risk the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents and or marketable securities primarily in euros japanese yen british pounds and chinese yuan if the u s dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches as a result of our services being web based and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers back office support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy we face significant inventory risk in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and or sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results table of contents we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item a as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the internet and the e commerce industry quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet related companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other e commerce or technology companies and transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet e commerce and electronic devices existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services unencumbered internet access to our services the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet e commerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumer to consumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business table of contents we do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions u s supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales however an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose obligations on out of state retailers to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses by acquisitions including integrations and investments by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations with a number of countries actively considering changes in this regard in addition we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals developments in an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or single sources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have long term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations our contracts with u s as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our e commerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability we are subject to payments related risks we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating table of contents rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer co branded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements such as maintaining capital and segregating funds and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions under our a z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers item unregistered sales

and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated balance sheets operating results and cash flows for the periods presented operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for due to seasonal and other factors certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in

conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are used for but not limited to determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and

purchase price allocations investments in equity interests and contingencies actual results could differ materially from those estimates earnings per share basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted average outstanding common shares diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method in periods when we recognize a net loss we exclude the impact of outstanding stock awards from the diluted loss per share calculation as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect the following table shows the calculation of diluted shares in millions threemonthsended march shares used in computation of basic earnings per share total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share equity method investments equity investments including our investment in livingsocial are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee the total of our investments in equity method investees including identifiable intangible assets deferred tax liabilities and goodwill is included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity method investees amortization of the related intangible assets and related gains or losses if any are classified as equity method investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations our share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes operating and non operating gains and charges which can have a significant impact on our reported equity method investment activity and the carrying value of those investments in the event that net losses of the investee reduce our equity method investment carrying amount to zero additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee not accounted for under the equity method are at risk even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee we regularly evaluate these investments which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment we also consider whether our equity method investments generate sufficient cash flows from their operating or financing activities to meet their obligations and repay their liabilities when they come due we record purchases including incremental purchases of shares in equity method investees at cost reductions in our ownership percentage of an investee including through dilution are generally valued at fair value with the difference between fair value and our recorded cost reflected as a gain or loss in our equity method investment activity in the event we no longer have the ability to exercise significant influence over an equity method investee we would discontinue accounting for the

taxes our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income for example the impact of discrete items and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower in our effective tax rate will be significantly affected by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the adverse effect of losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit income earned in lower tax jurisdictions is primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit reduce our pre tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate during q we recognized an income tax benefit of million which includes million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit that was enacted in january cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was million and million in q and q as of march and december gross unrecognized tax benefits tax contingencies were million and million we expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in in addition changes in state federal and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued it is reasonably possible that within the next months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings we are under examination or may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for the calendar year or
