in an accrual which is reviewed by the principal accounting officer before it is recorded a conclusion that a loss or an additional loss is reasonably possible results in a determination of whether the amount of the possible loss or range of loss is known reasonably estimable or not reasonably estimable although such determinations are made on a case by case basis in the context of patent

disclosures in doing so please tell us when you received the notices of proposed adjustment the approximate time you learned of the irs position on your transfer pricing why your tax contingencies at december december and march are significantly less than the approximate billion potential federal income tax expense impact disclosed and how you have satisfied the disclosure requirements of asc d response as part of our quarterly close process tax and accounting team members review and evaluate our existing and new uncertain tax positions including those related to transfer pricing they consider all relevant facts and circumstances including communications from tax authorities statutes of limitations relevant court cases existing legislation and other information in addition for purposes of meeting the disclosure requirements of asc d they evaluate whether it is reasonably possible that the total amount of income tax contingencies will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the relevant reporting date since the establishment of our european headquarters we have consistently disclosed that transfer pricing is a significant component of our tax contingencies in our k we disclosed that we transferred assets from the u s to other countries with the establishment of our european headquarters which may result in transfer pricing exposure specifically in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we stated associated with the establishment of our european headquarters we transferred certain of our operating assets in and from the u s to international locations these transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions additionally in each k from to we consistently disclosed that transfer pricing is a primary component of our tax contingencies for example in note other long term liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we said as of december the company has provided tax reserves of approximately million for u s and foreign income taxes which primarily relate to restructuring of certain foreign operations and intercompany pricing between our subsidiaries and in note long term liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we disclosed that our tax reserves for tax contingencies primarily relate to transfer pricing state income taxes and research and development credits the irs audited our transfer pricing relating to our and federal tax returns through an examination which principally took place between and on december we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs that proposed an adjustment to a portion of our transfer pricing the nopa was not material and represented approximately of the billion in potential federal tax expense contingencies that we subsequently disclosed on november we received a draft valuation report from consultants hired by the irs which included a valuation of assets transferred as part of the establishment of our european headquarters and the irs asked us to comment on the report representatives from the company the irs and the consultant met several times between november and january to discuss among other things this report on january we received the final valuation report from the consultant which revised and modified the november draft but retained the same valuation on march we received a second nopa which relied on the consultants final january report and which together with the first nopa resulted in our disclosure of the approximate billion potential federal income tax expense impact this second nopa was our first official notification from the irs regarding its preliminary position on the potential incremental transfer pricing impact even nopas however are proposed adjustments that are preliminary in nature and subject to negotiation and change until the irs examination team issues the revenue agents report at the conclusion of the audit based on our interpretation of the relevant regulations and case law including a recently issued taxpayer favorable tax court decision that provides further support to our analysis see veritas software corporation v commissioner u s tax ct lexis t c no dec we disagree with the two transfer pricing nopas accordingly we intend to vigorously contest these two nopas and to pursue all available administrative and if necessary judicial remedies however because of the amounts involved in the second nopa we disclosed in our first quarter q that these nopas proposed an increase to our u s taxable income which would result in additional federal tax expense over a seven year period beginning in totaling approximately billion subject to interest see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our first quarter q page our reserves for income tax contingencies at december of million at december of million and at march of million represent managements best judgment given the facts circumstances and information available at the time as we state in note description of business and accounting policies income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we utilize a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes further as we state in our note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our k page these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audits the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate we believe that our existing reserves for income tax contingencies which include amounts related to transfer pricing among other tax contingencies but are less than the amounts proposed by the irs in these two transfer pricing nopas represent adjustments that are more than likely of being realized additionally because we do not expect the matter to which the two transfer pricing nopas relate to be resolved in the next twelve months we disclosed the following in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our first quarter q page pursuant to asc d changes in state and federal tax laws or tax assessments may impact our tax contingencies it is reasonably possible that within the next months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities these assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies conclusion we hereby acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in its filings staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to
