effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit related developments foreign currency gains losses tax law developments including changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower for our effective tax rate will be favorably affected by the impact of the u s federal research and development credit an increase in amount of pre tax income relative to income tax expense an increase in amortization deductions for which we will realize a tax benefit and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses and losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses

timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our annual report on form k critical accounting judgmentsthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companysfinancial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note description of business and accounting policies of our annual report on form k and item of part i financial statements note accounting policies of this form q although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions inventoriesinventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write downs in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance as of june we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately million in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test is april in testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a two step impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the two step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired table of contentsa second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any we completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of april and determined that goodwill was not impaired during the quarter management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of april would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are short term in nature or a longer term trend we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged decrease from our june closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensationwe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes model the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee level economic conditions time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock based compensation changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock based compensation expense in the future as a measure of sensitivity a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately millionimpact on our q operating income our estimated forfeiture rate as of june and december was we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for recognizing compensation expense for example over of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method income taxeswe are subject to income taxes in the u s federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than

subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in and and we are currently contesting the matter in u s tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for and transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation

as specified above management does not expect however that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that its objectives will be met further no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected table of contentspart ii other informationitem legal proceedingssee item of part i financial statements note commitments and contingencies legal proceedings item a risk factorsplease carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks we face intense competitionour businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail e commerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and or greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resourceswe are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive riskswe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth ratewe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the u s or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers table of contentsour ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive websites products services price decreases or improvements changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet e commerce electronic devices and web services including outside the u s timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer free shipping continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies the extent to which our equity method investees record significant operating and non operating items the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events andterrorist attacks and armed hostilities our international operations expose us to a number of risksour international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation of e commerce and other services electronic devices and competition and restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payments and restrictions on pricing or discounts lower levels of use of the internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the u s table of contentslower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employee employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable u s and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties laws and policies of the u s and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes andgeopolitical events including war and terrorism as international e commerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth the peoples republic of china prc and india regulate amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements www amazon cn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi brand retail trading activities for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third party seller on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmedif we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipments we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation table of contentsthe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operationswe expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades split shipments and additional long zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationshipswe provide e commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and third party software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales therefore if the other companys offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results our present and future e commerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships anddifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investmentswe have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions table of contentsthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest andfor foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other than temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results we have foreign exchange riskthe results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents and or marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen if the u s dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our businesswe depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business we could be harmed by data loss or other security breachesas a result of our services being web based and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers back office support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancywe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results table of contentsour computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy we face significant inventory riskin addition to risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and or sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third partieswe regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatilewe have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item a as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in table of contentsquarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet related companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other e commerce or technology companies andtransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our businesswe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet e commerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites the characteristics and quality of products and services and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet e commerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumer to consumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business we could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilitiesu s supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales in the u s however an increasing number of states and certain foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest in addition if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we already collect sales tax or other indirect taxes were successfully to challenge our positions our tax liability could increase substantially we could be subject to additional income tax liabilitieswe are subject to income taxes in the u s federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the u s the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard except as required under u s tax laws we do not provide for u s taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the u s if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our u s operations we would be required to accrue or pay u s taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs table of contentsas well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our u s taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in and and we are currently contesting the matter in u s tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for and transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals our supplier relationships subject us to a number of riskswe have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or single sources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have long term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulationsour contracts with u s as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sellsome of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our e commerce services that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability we are subject to payments related riskswe accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazon branded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer co branded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating table of contentsresults could be adversely affected in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellersthe law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions under our a z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers table of contentsitem unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceedsnone item defaults

of our annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and if our estimated tax rate changes we make a cumulative adjustment our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in accurately predicting our pre tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments audit related developments foreign currency gains losses tax law developments including changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and non deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower for our effective tax rate will be favorably affected by the impact of the u s federal research and development credit an increase in amount of pre tax income relative to income tax expense an increase in amortization deductions for which we will realize a tax benefit and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses and losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit our effective tax rate will also be adversely affected by state income taxes we will generate income and losses in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg our income tax provision for the six months ended june was million which included million of discrete tax benefits primarily

timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued it is reasonably possible that within the next months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings we are under examination or may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for the calendar year and thereafter these examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net

we are continuing to evaluate our method of adoption and the impact this asu and related amendments and interpretations will have on our consolidated financial statements in november the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for income taxes and requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non current on the consolidated balance sheets the asu is effective for

fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for leases the new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than months in addition to those currently recorded on our consolidated balance sheets presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the asu however we expect the asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements primarily to the consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures in march the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for stock based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity this guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account
