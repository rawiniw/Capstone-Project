diverse board candidates at amazon com inc s annual meeting of shareholders on may this proposal calls on the amazon board of directors to implement a rooney rule requiring that the initial list of candidates from which new management supported director nominees are chosen should include but need not be limited to qualified women and minority candidates the rooney rule originated in the national football league where teams are required to interview at least one minority candidate for any open head coaching or general manager position in the corporate sector the rooney rule has been successfully implemented in the director search process by many companies including microsoft and costco i shareholders have long believed that embracing diversity will benefit companies by providing greater access to talent harnessing existing talent more effectively and improving decision making by reducing groupthink and similar psychological biases there is now ample evidence in support of this belief in a study of over corporations in countries mckinsey found that companies with the most diverse leadership top quartile for gender were more likely to earn above average profits while those in the top quartile for ethnic cultural diversity were more likely to outperform moreover mckinsey found that companies in the bottom tier of leadership diversity assessed on both gender and ethnic cultural were less likely to achieve above average profitability than all companies studied ii research from a wide variety of sources including the law firm paul hastings the peterson institute for international economics and credit suisse further bolsters the shareholder case for diversity while amazons board articulates support for diversity among directors and executives it has failed to translate that verbal support into practical action in particular the amazon board does not include any racial or ethnic minority directors this stands in contrast to the retail internet technology and media companies amazon identifies as peers in its current proxy statement each of which has at least one director of color while of the have at least three directors of color additionally only six of amazons top executives are asian only one is hispanic or latino and none are black or african american iii the underrepresentation of people of color in amazons leadership is at odds with its u s workforce which is fairly diverse black asian hispanic iv and may limit the board and the executive teams ability to identify business opportunities and risks for instance in bloomberg found that in six major same day delivery cities amazons service area excluded predominantly black zip codes amazon has subsequently expanded same day delivery in at least three of these cities v while a report by color of change found that amazons streaming service was one of eight networks at which more than of shows had zero or one black writer and that only one of amazon shows examined had a non white showrunner vi though the amazon board includes three female directors among its self identified peers a majority nine of have four or more female directors moreover amazons ongoing diversity and inclusion issues suggest the company could use more women in leadership according to the new york times only one of the executives reporting directly to the ceo is a woman vii while amazons eeoc filings indicate that only of amazons top executives are women viii again amazons leadership is less diverse than its workforce women comprise of amazon employees globally ix the website fairygoodboss com which allows women to rate their employers in terms of fairness and opportunity has ranked amazon far behind its major technology peers in each of the last two years x finally the roy price sexual harassment scandal in which amazon was aware of mr prices harassing behavior for nearly two years before taking action to remove himxi evinces a further basis for concern that the company has not established a tone at the top which regards harassment as unacceptable and diversity as a critical goal with six director departures in the last years amazon has had numerous opportunities to add gender racial and ethnic diversity to its board in addition its corporate governance guidelines have stated that the nominating and corporate governance committee seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives during that entire period but the low diversity status quo has persisted amazons two most recent director appointments have been white men both initially recommended by existing amazon directors in fact the last time amazon disclosed that a new director was not initially recommended by an existing director was with the exception that amazon provided no disclosure for an appointment in board diversity at amazon would be promoted by more meaningful external searches that also include women and minorities as candidates for example at microsoft and costco the rooney rule has contributed to diverse director appointments after adopting new policies microsoft has appointed three men and three women one of whom is a person of color and costco has appointed one woman and two men one of whom is a person of color our rooney rule proposal establishes a modest but demonstrably effective requirement that we believe will accelerate the transition from talk to action at amazon please join us in voting for item shareholder proposal regarding diverse candidates sincerely dieter waizenegger mary kay henryexecutive director ctw
