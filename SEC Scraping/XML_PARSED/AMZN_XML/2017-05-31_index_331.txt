audited and certified as conflict free by a reputable independent third party we actively reviewed and discussed our policy regarding gold tin tungsten and tantalum with each supplier unable to determine the origin of gold tin tungsten or tantalum and we will continue evaluating the results of their efforts report on supply chain due diligencethis report is publicly filed with the sec and is

process the gold tin tungsten or tantalum in our in scope products for suppliers that were unable to determine the sources of such minerals we actively reviewed and discussed with each such supplier our policy regarding gold tin tungsten and tantalum andwill continue evaluating the results of their efforts in in order to mitigate the risk that minerals procured by any of our suppliers benefit armed groups in the drc region annex a below includes a list of known smelters and refiners that may have processed gold tin tungsten or tantalum in the in scope products based on our review of data
