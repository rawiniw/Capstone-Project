dear mr thompson on behalf of amazon com inc this responds to your letter of september regarding our annual report on form k for the year ended december the k and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june the q q each of your comments is set forth below followed by our response form k for the fiscal year ended december managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsresults of operationsnet sales page you state that north american and international net sales have increased in the last three fiscal years primarily as a result of increased unit sales which were driven in part by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise please revise future periodic reports to expand your discussion to describe the drivers of net sales in the electronics and other general merchandise product category so that investors may better understand any trends that have had or that you reasonably expect to have an impact on such net sales and the extent to which the increase in north american and international net sales is attributable to the increase in unit sales in such product category in addition given the breadth of this category please also provide additional granularity as to the types of products within electronics and other general merchandise that are causing faster growth please refer to item a of regulation s k and section iii b of sec release no october page responsehistorically our presentation of revenue data for the media and egm categories which as noted further below we ceased to disclose after december provided investors information about groups of similar products and services that reflected the growth and development of our business beyond our initial offerings as an online book retailer this presentation also was consistent with our entity wide disclosures regarding revenue from similar products and services however growth in overall unit sales has been the primary driver of net sales across the many and expanding products and services sold through our website and we have not identified individual drivers within media or egm instead we focus on providing a wide selection of services and hundreds of millions of products and services to our customers across many categories our experience over time has demonstrated that increased sales are driven by our focus on reducing prices for our customers including from shipping offers increasing in stock inventory availability increasing selection and enhancing the customer experience accordingly in coordination with our response to the comments we received from the staff of the division of corporation finance the staff on our annual report on form k for the year ended december and our subsequent discussions with the staff and determination to change the entity wide disclosures we present pursuant to asc we also evaluated our presentation of revenue data in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda as a result in the q q and subsequent quarterly reports we have determined not to refer to an egm category and we do not address product categories as a driver of unit sales we will continue to monitor the revenue drivers associated with our operations and will identify in future periodic reports any trends that have or are expected to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations technology and content page please disclose a break out of research and development expense by project activity or in whatever fashion you believe will provide more transparency as to the magnitude and direction of your research and development activities responsesee discussion related to our research and development expenses included in response to question below notes to consolidated financial statementsnote description of business and accounting policiestechnology and content page please tell us and disclose in future filings the total amount of research and development costs charged to expense for each year presented in the consolidated statements of operations as required by asc october page please also explain in detail the nature of expenses by project or activity that you categorize as research and development costs please specifically describe the types of costs related to your initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electric devices and development of new products and services as well as aws and technology infrastructure costs please indicate what portion of such costs represents research and development expenditures in explaining the types of costs please also describe any engineering or other costs excluded from research and development costs to the extent you can categorize items included and excluded from research and development by the type of activity illustrated in asc and that would be helpful to our understanding lastly we note your disclosure that content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection please explain to us why its appropriate to combine content costs with technology costs which we understand to be primarily research and development costs we may have further comments responsein response to the staffs last question which we are addressing first because it helps to inform the basis of our response to this comment we combine technology and content costs because this grouping of cost best depicts the investments we make to enhance our customers experience this includes investments we make to improve the functionality or appearance of our websites the speed at which they operate the selection of products or services we make available on them and the manner in which we categorize and display items on them these efforts are intended to improve and facilitate the customer experience likewise we invest in the development of new products and services beyond our website in an effort to serve our customers and invent on their behalf these investments may include e readers tablets streaming video voice automation and compute and storage power which are intended to enhance the customer experience by expanding the variety of products and services we offer collectively technology and content costs further our efforts to bring selection price and availability to our customers including through research development maintenance and other enhancements our business model encourages the simultaneous research design development and maintenance of both new and existing products and services for example our teams are constantly working to build new alexa skills and simultaneously maintain current skills and these activities are within a continuum of those described in asc and and are not easily distinguishable operationally we focus on innovation and customer obsession and manage the total investment in our employees and infrastructure in order to improve the customer experience we believe our technology and content presentation is most representative of the investments we make on behalf of our customers with regard to the nature of the costs that we incur by project activity magnitude or direction the sheer volume and diversity of our innovations and other activities does not lend itself well to any further refinement of technology and content expenses the volume and diversity of these activities is best illustrated in the highlights section of our quarterly earnings releases which are attached as exhibits to our item form ks in these documents we provide a condensed list of our innovations that were introduced during the quarter the list for a quarters worth of activity often spans multiple pages product and service categories and customer groups and thus defies simple categorization instead we believe a october page more consumable mda discussion is one that describes the reasons for increasing or decreasing infrastructure and personnel cost as described in our historical filings these are the primary drivers in technology and content cost based on the staffs comments we recognize we can make these factors more clear in our filings by revising our future disclosures as reflected in the mock up of our k language below

application production maintenance operation and developmentthe research and developmentof new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure costs content costs

curation and display of products and services made available on our websites and infrastructure costs infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support aws as well as these and other efforts collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers we seek to invest efficiently in numerousseveralareas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross functionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in and compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible forexpanding our products and services and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our aws segment technology infrastructure costs consist of servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and payroll expenses these costs are allocated to segments based on usage in and we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for aws service offerings globally compared to the comparable prior year periods additionally the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time corresponding with increased usage we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage the increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings including aws and initiatives to introduce new product and service offerings october page for and we capitalized million including million of stock based compensation million including

contingencieslegal proceedings page we note your disclosure that for some of the matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible your disclosure implies that there are some matters for which you are able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued please tell us the matters for which you are able to estimate the possible loss or range in loss in excess of amounts accrued and the amounts thereof also if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may have occurred in your next periodic filing please either disclose an estimate or if true state that the estimate is immaterial in lieu of providing quantified amounts of the additional loss or range of loss or state such an estimate cannot be made you may provide your disclosures on an aggregate basis please refer to asc responsepursuant to asc if a loss is probable or reasonably possible and an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss in excess of any amount accrued is both possible and material we would disclose such estimate the disclosure in our k is not intended to suggest otherwise and in future filings we will revise our disclosure as follows october page the outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable subject to significant uncertainties and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period in addition for thesomematters disclosed above that do not includefor which a loss is probable or reasonably possible an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses such an estimateis not possibleor is immaterial and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non monetary remedies for each of the matters disclosed as a loss contingency in our k either we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss or the high end of the range was not material in each case in excess of amounts accrued if any as reflected in our k most of the loss contingencies we disclose involve patent claims among the factors affecting our assessment of these cases are that the proceedings are in early stages and the pleadings often lack specificity for the non patent contingencies factors affecting our assessment include that the claims involve novel theories of liability and the plaintiffs may claim to represent a class of indeterminate size while many of the cases we disclose are dismissed at early stages we reassess our loss exposure at least quarterly and in the event we conclude a loss is both probable and estimable we accrue such amount at such times we also assess whether we can estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of any accrued amounts while we have concluded that we are not able to estimate such amounts for the reasons described above or that any estimable amounts in excess of amounts accrued are not material we will in the future disclose such amount if estimable and material in the absence of a determination of a possible loss or range of loss we also consider whether other information is available that could assist shareholders in assessing the nature of our loss contingencies and provide such information when available for example if a patent case reaches the stage where the plaintiff has produced an expert report on alleged damages we disclose those claims thus in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june we made the following disclosure about a loss contingency where a damages report became available in february eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability amazon could be subject to million in damages form q for the quarterly period ended june note commitments and contingencieslegal proceedings page we note that there are several legal proceedings disclosed in form k for the fiscal year ended december that are not disclosed in the note rule a of regulation s x requires disclosure of material contingencies even though a significant change since year end may not have occurred as such in future quarterly reports where material contingencies exist please disclose such matters even though a significant change since year end may not have occurred october page responsewe acknowledge that rule a of regulation s x provides that where material contingencies exist disclosure of such matters must be provided in interim financial disclosure even though a significant change since year end may not have occurred we further acknowledge that rule a of regulation s x states that r egistrants may presume that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation except in regard to material contingencies may be determined in that context emphasis added we respectfully believe that the q q satisfies this standard instead of presuming that users have read the audited financial statements our commitments and contingencies footnote discloses the material contingencies associated with the ongoing legal proceedings identified in the k by expressly referring readers to those legal proceedings disclosures specifically item of part i of the q q financial statements note commitments and contingencies states the company is involved from time to time in claims proceedings and litigation including the matters described in item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note commitments and contingencies legal proceedings of our annual report on form k and in item of part financial statements note commitments and contingencies legal proceedings of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended march as supplemented by the following we believe this approach is consistent with common practice effectively informs the reader of all information needed for a fair presentation of our interim financial information and given that the disclosures regarding legal proceedings in our annual reports typically span multiple pages provides readers of our financial statements with greater clarity and relevant information regarding the current status of material contingencies associated with our legal proceedings october page if you have any questions or further comments please contact me by email at shelleyr amazon com or by phone at very truly
