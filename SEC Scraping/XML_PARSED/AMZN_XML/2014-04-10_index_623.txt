to take you on a tour that samples a small subset of our various initiatives ranging from prime to amazon smile to mayday the goal is to give you a sense for how much is going on across amazon and how exciting it is to work on these programs this broad array of initiatives is only possible because a large team of talented people at every level are exercising their good judgment every day and always asking how do we make this better ok lets get started on the tour prime customers love prime more than one million customers joined prime in the third week of december alone and there are now tens of millions of prime members worldwide on a per customer basis prime members are ordering more items across more categories than ever before even internally its easy for us to forget that prime was a new unproven some even said foolhardy concept when we launched it nine years ago all you can eat two day shipping for a flat annual fee at that time we had one million eligible prime products this year we passed million eligible products and we continue to add more weve made prime better in other ways too adding new digital benefits including the kindle owners lending library and prime instant video

instant video prime instant video is experiencing tremendous growth across all metrics including new customers repeat usage and total number of streams these are output metrics and they suggest we are on a good path focusing on the right inputs two of the key inputs are the growth of selection and the desirability of that selection since we launched piv in with titles weve grown selection to more than movies and tv episodes all included in your prime membership piv has exclusives on hundreds of sought after tv seasons including downton abbey the ratings blockbuster under the dome the americans justified grimm orphan black suits and kids programs such as spongebob squarepants dora the explorer and blues clues in addition our amazon studios team continues to invest heavily in original content

after from chris carter of the x files mozart in the jungle from roman coppola and jason schwartzman and jill soloways beautiful transparent which some have called the best pilot in years we like our approach and are replicating it with our recent rollout of piv in both the uk and germany the early customer response in those countries has been terrific surpassing our expectations fire tv just this

second player provides air support from a tablet i can assure you that there are some intense moments when youll appreciate a well timed air strike when you see it you may be surprised that this level of game play is possible on an inexpensive streaming media device sev zero is only the first of a collection of innovative and graphically beautiful games were building from the ground up for fire tablets and fire tv amazon appstore the amazon appstore now serves customers in almost countries selection has grown to include over apps and games from top developers around the globe nearly tripling in size over the past year we introduced amazon coins a virtual currency that saves customers up to on app and in app purchases our whispersync for games technology lets you start a game on one device and continue it on another without losing your progress developers can use the mobile associates program to offer millions of physical products from amazon inside their apps and earn referral fees when customers buy those items we introduced appstore developer select a marketing program that promotes new apps and games on kindle fire tablets and on amazons mobile ad network we created analytics

gatsby which has already sold copies whispersync for voice allows customers to switch seamlessly back and forth between reading a book on their kindle and listening to the corresponding audible book on their smart phone the wall street journal called whispersync for voice amazons new killer app for books if you havent already i recommend you give it a try its fun and expands the amount of time you have available to read fresh grocery after trialing the service for five years in seattle no one accuses us of a lack of patience we expanded amazon fresh to los angeles and san francisco prime fresh members pay a year and receive same day and early morning delivery not only on fresh grocery items but also on over other items ranging from toys to electronics to household goods were also partnering with favorite local merchants the cheese store of beverly hills pike place fish market san francisco wine trading company and many more to provide the same convenient home delivery on a great selection of prepared foods and specialty items well continue our methodical approach measuring and refining amazon fresh with the goal of bringing this incredible service to more cities over time amazon web services aws is eight years old and the teams pace of innovation is actually accelerating in we launched significant services and features in that number was in it was in were also expanding our geographic footprint we now have aws regions around the world including the east coast of the u s two on the west coast europe singapore tokyo sydney brazil china and a government only region called govcloud we have availability zones across regions and edge locations for our content distribution network the development teams work directly with customers and are empowered to design build and launch based on what they learn we iterate continuously and when a feature or enhancement is ready we push it out and make it instantly available to all this approach is fast customer centric and efficient its allowed us to reduce prices more than times in the past years and the teams have no plans to slow down employee empowerment we challenge ourselves to not only invent outward facing features but also to find better ways to do things internally things that will both make us more effective and benefit our thousands of employees around the world career choice is a program where we pre pay of tuition for our employees to take courses for in demand fields such as airplane mechanic or nursing regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at amazon the goal is to enable choice we know that for some of our fulfillment center employees amazon will be a career for others amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job somewhere else a job that may require new skills if the right training can make the difference we want to help the second program is called pay to quit it was invented by the clever people at zappos and the amazon fulfillment centers have been iterating on it pay to quit is pretty simple once a year we offer to pay our associates to quit the first year the offer is made its for then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches the headline on the offer is please dont take this offer we hope they dont take the offer we want them to stay why do we make this offer the goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want in the long run an employee staying somewhere they dont want to be isnt healthy for the employee or the company a third inward innovation is our virtual contact center its an idea we started a few years back and have continued to grow with terrific results under this program employees provide customer service support for amazon and kindle customers while working from home this flexibility is ideal for many employees who perhaps because they have young children or for another reason either cannot or prefer not to work outside the home our virtual contact center is our fastest growing site in the u s operating in more than ten states today this growth will continue as we hope to double our state footprint in veteran hiring we seek leaders who can invent think big have a bias for action and deliver results on behalf of customers these principles look familiar to men and women whove served our country in the armed forces and we find that their experience leading people is invaluable in our fast paced work environment were a member of joining forces and the jobs mission two national efforts that encourage businesses to offer service members and their families career opportunities and support our military talent team attended more than recruiting events last year to help veterans find job opportunities at amazon in we hired more than veterans and once veterans join our team we offer several programs that help them transition more easily into the civilian workforce and that connect them with our internal network of veterans for mentoring and support these programs have earned us recognition as a top employer by g i jobs magazine u s veterans magazine and military spouse magazine and well continue to invest in military veteran hiring as we grow fulfillment innovation nineteen years ago i drove the amazon packages to the post office every evening in the back of my chevy blazer my vision extended so far that i dreamed we might one day get a forklift fast forward to today and we have fulfillment centers and are on our th generation of fulfillment center design our operations team is extraordinary methodical and ingenious through our kaizen program named for the japanese term change for the better employees work in small teams to streamline processes and reduce defects and waste our earth kaizens set energy reduction recycling and other green goals in more than associates participated in kaizens sophisticated software is key in our fcs this year we rolled out major software improvements across the fc network our goal is to continue to iterate and improve on the design layout technology and operations in these buildings ensuring that each new facility we build is better than the last i invite you to come see one for yourself we offer fulfillment center tours open to the public ages six and above you can find info on the available tours at www amazon com fctours im always amazed when i visit one of our fcs and i hope youll arrange a tour i think youll be impressed urban campus in we added square feet of new headquarters space in seattle and broke ground on what will become four city blocks and several million square feet of new construction it is a fact that we could have saved money by instead building in the suburbs but for us it was important to stay in the city urban campuses are much greener our employees are able to take advantage of existing communities and public transit infrastructure with less dependence on cars were investing in dedicated bike lanes to provide safe pollution free easy access to our offices many of our employees can live nearby skip the commute altogether and walk to work though i cant prove it i also believe an urban headquarters will help keep amazon vibrant attract the right talent and be great for the health and wellbeing of our employees and the city of seattle fast delivery in partnership with the united states postal service weve begun for the first time to offer sunday delivery to select cities sunday delivery is a win for amazon customers and we plan to roll it out to a large portion of the u s population throughout weve created our own fast last mile delivery networks in the uk where commercial carriers couldnt support our peak volumes in india and china where delivery infrastructure isnt yet mature you can see amazon bike couriers delivering packages throughout the major cities and there is more invention to come the prime air team is already flight testing our th and th generation aerial vehicles and we are in the design phase on generations and experiments and more experiments we have our own internal experimentation platform called weblab that we use to evaluate improvements to our websites and products in we ran weblabs worldwide up from in and in one recent success is our new feature called ask an owner it was many years ago that we pioneered the idea of online customer reviews customers sharing their opinion on a product to help other customers make an informed purchase decision ask is in that same tradition from a product page customers can ask any question related to the product is the product compatible with my tv stereo pc is it easy to assemble how long does the battery last we then route these questions to owners of the product as is the case with reviews customers are happy to share their knowledge to directly help other customers millions of questions have already been asked and answered apparel and shoes amazon fashion is booming premium brands are recognizing that they can use amazon to reach fashion conscious high demo customers and customers are enjoying the selection free returns detailed photos and video clips that let them see how clothes move and drape as the models walk and turn we opened a new square foot photo studio in brooklyn and now shoot an average of photos every day in the studios bays to celebrate the opening we hosted a design contest with students from pratt parsons school of visual arts and the fashion institute of technology that was judged by a panel of industry leaders including steven kolb eva chen derek lam tracy reese and steven alan kudos to parsons who took home the top prize frustration free packaging our battle against annoying wire ties and plastic clamshells rages on an initiative that began five years ago with a simple idea that you shouldnt have to risk bodily injury opening your new electronics or toys has now grown to over products all available in easy to open recyclable packaging designed to alleviate wrap rage and help the planet by reducing packaging waste we have over manufacturers in our frustration free packaging program including fisher price mattel unilever belkin victorinox swiss army logitech and many more weve now shipped many millions of frustration free items to countries we are also reducing waste for customers eliminating million pounds of excess packaging to date this program is a perfect example of a missionary team staying heads down focused on serving customers through hard work and perseverance an idea that started with only products is now available on hundreds of thousands and benefiting millions of customers fulfillment by amazon the number of sellers using fulfillment by amazon grew more than last year growth like that at such large scale is unusual fba is unique in many ways its not often you get to delight two customer sets with one program with fba sellers can store their products in our fulfillment centers and we pick pack ship and provide customer service for these products sellers benefit from one of the most advanced fulfillment networks in the world easily scaling their businesses to reach millions of customers and not just any customers prime members fba products can be eligible for prime free two day shipping customers benefit from this additional selection they get even more value out of their prime membership and unsurprisingly sellers see increased sales when they join fba in a survey nearly three out of four fba respondents reported that their unit sales increased on amazon com more than after joining fba its a win win fba is the best employee i have ever had one morning i woke up and realized fba had shipped units as soon as i realized i could sell products while i sleep it was a no brainer thanny schuck action sports llc starting out as an unknown brand it was difficult to find retailers willing to stock our goods no such barriers existed at amazon the beauty of amazon is that someone can say i want to start a business and they can go on amazon and really start a business you dont have to get a lease on a building or even have any employees at first you can just do it on your own and thats what i did wendell morris yogarat login and pay with amazon for several years weve enabled amazon customers to pay on other sites such as kickstarter smugmug and gogo inflight using the credit cards and shipping addresses already stored in their amazon account this year we expanded that capability so customers can also sign in using their amazon account credentials saving them the annoyance of needing to remember yet another account name and password its convenient for the customer and a business builder for the merchant cymax stores the online furniture retailer has seen tremendous success with login and pay it now accounts for of their orders tripling their new account registrations and increasing purchase conversion in the first three months this example isnt unusual we are seeing results like these with many partners and the team is excited and encouraged you should look for more in amazon smile in we launched amazon smile a simple way for customers to support their favorite charitable organizations every time they shop when you shop at smile amazon com amazon donates a portion of the purchase price to the charity of your choice youll find the same selection prices shipping options and prime eligibility on smile amazon com as you do on amazon com youll even find your same shopping cart and wish lists in addition to the large national charities you would expect you can also designate your local childrens hospital your schools pta or practically any other cause you might like there are almost a million charities to choose from i hope youll find your favorite on the list the mayday button not only is the device awesome but the mayday feature is absolutely fantastic the kindle team has hit it out of the park with this one just tried the mayday button on my hdx second response timeamazon has done it again thoroughly impressed nothing gives us more pleasure at amazon than reinventing normal creating inventions that customers love and resetting their expectations for what normal should be mayday reimagines and revolutionizes the idea of on device tech support tap the mayday button and an amazon expert will appear on your fire hdx and can co pilot you through any feature by drawing on your screen walking you through how to do something yourself or doing it for you whatever works best mayday is available x days a year and our response time goal is seconds or less we beat that goal with an average response time of only seconds on our busiest day christmas a few of the maydays have been amusing mayday tech advisors have received marriage proposals from customers customers have asked to talk to amy our mayday television personality maydays have been customers asking for assistance with ordering a pizza by a slim margin pizza hut wins customer preference over dominos there are instances where the mayday tech advisor has sung happy birthday to the customer mayday tech advisors have been serenaded by customers times and customers have asked for a bedtime story pretty cool i hope that gives you some sense of the scope of our opportunity and initiatives as well the inventive spirit and push for exceptional quality with which theyre undertaken i should underscore again that this is a subset there are many programs ive omitted in this letter that are just as promising consequential and interesting as those ive highlighted we have the good fortune of a large inventive team and a patient pioneering customer obsessed culture great innovations large and small are happening everyday on behalf of customers and at all levels throughout the company this decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company not limited to the companys senior leaders is the only way to get robust high throughput innovation what were doing is challenging and fun we get to work in the future failure comes part and parcel with invention its not optional we understand that and believe in failing early and iterating until we get it right when this process works it means our failures are relatively small in size most experiments can start small and when we hit on something that is really working for customers we double down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success however its not always as clean as that inventing is messy and over time its certain that well fail at some big bets too id like to close by remembering joy covey joy was amazons cfo in the early days and she left an indelible mark on the company joy was brilliant intense and so fun she smiled a lot and her eyes were always wide missing nothing she was substance over optics she was a long term thinker she had a deep keel joy was bold she had a profound impact on all of us on the senior team and on the companys entire culture part of her will always be here making sure we watch the details see the world around us and all have fun i feel super lucky to be a part of the amazon team as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc april letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
