the audit committee tom a alberg thomas o ryder wendell p weeks item advisory vote to approve executive compensation we are asking shareholders to approve on an advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis the summary compensation table and the related compensation tables and narrative our executive compensation programs are designed to support our long term success as described in the compensation discussion and analysis section of this proxy statement the leadership development and compensation committee has structured our executive compensation program to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price we note that our stock price has increased approximately between january and december in addition the total number of restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers during represented only i of the total number of restricted stock units granted to all employees during and ii of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the total number of restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers during the three year period from to represented only i of the total number of restricted stock units granted to all employees during the same three year period and ii of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the same three year period for more information shareholders should read the compensation discussion and analysis which describes how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives as well as the summary compensation table and related compensation tables and narrative which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers the leadership development and compensation committee and the board believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the compensation discussion and analysis are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our named executive officers reported in this proxy statement has supported and contributed to our success at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders approved on an advisory basis a frequency of every three years for casting advisory votes approving our executive compensation after the annual meeting our next advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at our annual meeting of shareholders unless the company announces otherwise following the board of directors consideration of the advisory vote provided in item of this proxy statement regarding the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation this item is being presented pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act although this advisory vote is not binding the leadership development and compensation committee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program the board of directors recommends a vote for approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement item advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation pursuant to section a of the exchange act we are asking shareholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation shareholders may specify whether they prefer such votes to occur every year every two years or every three years or they may abstain the board recommends that such vote occur every three years because the company takes a long term view of employee compensation including executive compensation because of the unique nature of our executive compensation program where a substantial portion of employee compensation is in the form of restricted stock units that are granted periodically and typically vest over five years or more we believe that it is more appropriate to evaluate our executive compensation by comparing amounts received by our executives and our total shareholder return over a three year period instead of evaluating our executive compensation based on the total grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards granted each year although the shareholders vote on this proposal is not binding the board will consider the voting results in determining the frequency of future advisory votes notwithstanding the boards recommendation and the outcome of the shareholder vote the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoption of material changes to compensation programs at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders approved on an advisory basis a frequency of every three years for casting advisory votes approving our executive compensation the board of directors recommends that future advisory votes on executive compensation continue to occur once every three years because our executive compensation programs are designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years shareholders should evaluate how our programs perform over the long term also an advisory vote every three years provides an appropriate period for the leadership development and compensation committee and the board to evaluate the results of the most recent advisory vote on executive compensation and to develop and implement any appropriate adjustments to our executive compensation programs conducting an advisory vote every three years provides shareholders a meaningful opportunity to provide regular feedback and sufficient time for us to respond to it our last two advisory votes to approve executive compensation were approved by more than of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the respective annual meetings of our shareholders the board of directors recommends shareholders vote on an advisory basis to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation every three years item approval of the companys stock incentive plan as amended and restated the board of directors recommends that shareholders approve the plan including the material terms of the performance goals set forth in the plan approval of the material terms of the performance goals is a condition for certain awards made under the plan to qualify as tax deductible performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code in addition approval of the plan is intended to satisfy shareholder approval requirements for making certain tax qualified awards under the plan to our french employees each of these aspects of the plan along with a summary of other significant terms of the plan is set forth in appendix a to this proxy statement which is incorporated herein by reference shareholder approval of this proposal does not increase the number of shares of amazon common stock reserved for grant pursuant to awards issued under the plan the discussion below and the summary of the plan attached as appendix a to this proxy statement are qualified by reference to the text of the plan a copy of the plan was included as an exhibit to our form q filed on april and can be obtained upon request from the secretary of the company section m section m places a limit of million on the amount the company may deduct in any one year for compensation paid to a covered employee which means any person who as of the last day of the fiscal year is the chief executive officer or one of the companys three highest compensated executive officers other than the cfo as determined under sec rules there is however an exception to this limit on deductibility for compensation that satisfies certain conditions for qualified performance based compensation set forth under section m one of the conditions requires shareholder approval every five years of the material terms of the performance goals of the plan under which the compensation will be paid as noted above the companys shareholders most recently approved the material terms of the performance goals of the plan at the companys annual meeting the list of business criteria on which performance goals may be based remains unchanged and the company is asking shareholders to approve the material terms of the performance goals under the plan for purposes of section m the material terms of the performance goals include i the employees eligible to receive compensation under the plan ii a description of the business criteria on which the performance goal is based and iii the maximum amount of compensation that can be paid to an employee under the performance goal each of these aspects of the plan is discussed in appendix a to this proxy statement the board believes that it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to enable the company to implement compensation arrangements that qualify as fully tax deductible performance based compensation in the plan the board is therefore asking shareholders to approve for section m purposes the material terms of the performance goals as set forth in appendix a to this proxy statement however shareholder approval of the plan is only one of several requirements under section m that must be satisfied for amounts realized under the plan to qualify for the performance based compensation exemption under section m and submission of the material terms of the plans performance goals for shareholder approval should not be viewed as a guarantee that the company can deduct all compensation under the plan nothing in this proposal precludes the company or the leadership development and compensation committee from making any payment or granting awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m nor is there any guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service french tax qualified rsu grants france adopted a finance act in december the finance law which along with another law adopted in august loi macron introduced changes to the terms under which french tax qualified restricted stock units rsus including performance based rsus may be granted to employees of our subsidiaries in france one of the conditions for granting french tax qualified rsus under the finance law is that the rsus are granted pursuant to an equity incentive plan approved by shareholders on or after december shareholder approval of this proposal will satisfy one of the requirements of the finance law for granting tax qualified rsus to employees of our subsidiaries in france under the finance law french tax qualified rsus granted to employees of our french subsidiaries may benefit from certain french income and social tax treatment provided certain conditions are met following shareholder approval of this proposal we will determine whether or not to seek to satisfy the other requirements to grant tax qualified rsus in france the

employment decisions the report shall be prepared at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information and shall be made available on the companys website no later than the annual meeting of shareholders supporting statement approximately one third of us adults have a criminal record according to the national employment law project http www nelp org campaign ensuring fair chance to work because the criminal justice system disproportionately affects minorities the use of arrest and conviction records in employment decisions may violate the civil rights act of and the equal employment opportunity commissions guidelines if such policies are not job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity https www eeoc gov laws guidance arrest conviction cfm our company is a large and growing employer who also subcontracts with staffing agencies and uses independent contractors for various positions including warehouse jobs and delivery drivers like at many companies criminal background checks are used in hiring decisions for these positions in our opinion excluding individuals who have had previous contact with the criminal justice system may hurt our companys competitiveness in attracting and retaining top talent the disparate impact that such practices may have on people of color may also work against our companys commitment to diversity while it may be appropriate to disqualify certain individuals with relevant criminal records from specific positions an overly restrictive ban on employing all individuals with any criminal record in effect imposes a second sentence we believe that previously incarcerated individuals who have paid their debt to society deserve a chance to achieve gainful employment on october the lawyers committee for civil rights and economic justice wrote to our companys ceo jeff bezos to express concern about a purported new company directive that requires delivery companies that our company contracts with to institute more stringent background check procedures the letter alleges that dozens of primarily black and latino delivery drivers in the boston area were terminated as a result of this change http lawyerscom org lawyers committee urges amazon to halt employment practices that harm communities of color this proposal urges the board of directors to prepare a report on the companys criminal background check practices and policies and the risk that racial discrimination may result in our view the use of criminal background checks for employment decisions creates significant legal reputational and operational risks accordingly we believe that the board of directors has an obligation to adequately inform itself of and manage these material risks to the company for these reasons we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by afl cio reserve fund recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we are strongly committed to providing an equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind additionally our process for performing background checks on prospective employees and contracted service providers serves significant public safety and business purposes the nature of our business requires that we implement certain controls to protect our customers employees and the public and serve the interests of our shareholders for example our contracted delivery drivers operate largely independently in the field without direct supervision they are in contact with customers and other members of the public including children and vulnerable adults often face to face at the customers doorstep and in some cases after dark in this context it is critically important to managing our reputational operational and legal risks that background checks are performed accordingly taking into account the nature of a conviction the time that has elapsed and the nature of the job for which an individual is being considered we do consider certain types of serious criminal convictions to be disqualifying our processes for conducting background checks involve complex considerations that are designed to be fair reasonable and lawful and to achieve the primary goal of protecting employees customers and the public further we believe our targeted screening process is well tailored to protecting public safety and our business interests we do not allow or condone racial discrimination of any kind in the background checking process or otherwise we are strongly committed to providing an equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and we are proud of the diverse population of drivers who serve our customers diversity is a cornerstone of our continued success and we benefit from the diverse perspectives of our employees that come from many sources including gender race age national origin sexual orientation disability culture education as well as professional and life experience given our commitment to equality and the nature of our business the board believes that the preparation of the report requested by the proposal would not be an effective and prudent use of the companys time and resources the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding a report on use of criminal background checks in hiring decisions item shareholder proposal regarding sustainability as an executive compensation performance measure mercy for animals sunset boulevard suite los angeles california a beneficial owner of shares of common stock of the company has notified us that it intends to present the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by mercy for animals resolved that the shareholders of amazon com request the boards compensation committee when setting senior executive compensation include sustainability as one of the performance measures for senior executives under the companys incentive plans sustainability is defined as how environmental and social considerations and related financial impacts are integrated into corporate strategy over the long term supporting statement we believe that the long term interests of shareholders as well as other important constituents are best served by companies that operate their businesses in a sustainable manner focused on long term value creation as the recent financial crisis demonstrates those boards of directors and management that operate their companies with integrity and a focus on the long term are much more likely to prosper than ones that are dominated by a short term focus the best means of demonstrating a companys commitment to the concept of sustainability is through incorporating it as a performance measure in the companys annual and or long term incentive plans we believe that the current failure to do so represents a serious shortcoming examples of sustainability metrics include evaluation of how its operations may affect environmental pollution natural resource depletion the social and environmental impact of industrial agriculture and manufacturing and other appropriate issues of corporate social responsibility and sustainability several studies within the past few years show that businesses incorporating environmental and social considerations into their corporate governance strategies are better able to mitigate risk in legal regulatory and reputational areas and thus increase overall performance and efficiency according to a un global compact and accenture study entitled ceo study on sustainability percent of executives believe that including sustainability in fundamental corporate strategy will drive revenue growth and increase opportunities percent believe sustainability is a major factor for organizational success and percent believe sustainability should be a factor discussed when determining compensation percent reported that they already do a harvard business school study from determined that organizations that embraced progressive environmental and social programs outperformed those that did not in both the stock market as well as accounting performance further in a report entitled greening the green linking executive pay to sustainability from glass lewis found that a mounting body of research showing that firms that operate in a more responsible manner may perform better financially moreover these companies were also more likely to tip top executive incentives to sustainability metrics finally a report published by the united nations principles for responsible investment and the un global compact found that including environmental social and governance esg issues within executive management goals and incentive schemes is an essential factor in determining long term shareholder worth determining which specific metrics to utilize rests within the discretion of the board and its compensation committee end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by mercy for animals recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal while the board recognizes the importance of good corporate citizenship and is committed to sustainability and social responsibility it does not believe that making sustainability a performance measure for senior executives is necessary or in the

directors should maintain the ability to develop executive compensation principles and practices as it sees fit the board believes that it is appropriate for the leadership development and compensation committee to determine the performance measures against which executives are measured the executive compensation program currently in place as developed by the leadership development and compensation committee promotes the long term interests of shareholders in how it incentivizes executives our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value the primary component of each executive officers total compensation is stock based as a result we believe that the success of our substantial sustainability efforts is already included in the long term view of creating shareholder value through our stock price and is already a part of our executive compensation incentive structure and the board believes that making sustainability an explicit executive compensation performance measure is not necessary the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding sustainability as an executive compensation performance measure item shareholder proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals investor voice spc queen anne avenue n suite seattle washington acting on behalf of bryce a mathern a beneficial owner of shares of common stock of the company has notified us that it intends to present the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice resolved amazon com inc amazon shareholders ask the board to take or initiate steps to amend company governing documents to provide that all non binding matters presented by shareholders shall be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast for and against an item this policy would apply to all such matters unless shareholders have approved higher thresholds or applicable laws or stock exchange regulations dictate otherwise supporting statement this proposal seeks greater transparency clarity and understanding around how informed stockholders vote on shareholder proposals in voting the meaning of abstain is defined by the oxford english dictionary as to formally decline to vote either for or against a proposal or motion a simple majority formula therefore includes votes cast for and against but not abstentions it provides the most democratic clear and accurate picture of the intent of shareowners who are both informed and decided while not including in the formula the votes of abstaining voters who by definition have declined to express an opinion when abstaining voters choose to mark abstain whether they are confused disinterested or lack time to become fully informed it is apparent that their votes should be regarded as neither for nor against an item in contrast amazon unilaterally counts abstain votes as if against every shareholder sponsored proposal is it reasonable for amazon to assert it knows the will of undecided voters and to artificially construe abstentions in favor of management companies often imply they have no choice but to use the delaware default standard which includes abstentions however this nominal standard is not mandated it is what delaware assigns to companies that do not proactively choose simple majority voting research has demonstrated that the so called default standard systematically disadvantages shareholders http bit ly voting research corporate secretary how it does this by depressing the appearance of support for shareholder concerns the math is simple when abstaining shareholders elect to not express an opinion but then are treated as if they voted against a proposal the tally is lowered and management benefits because they routinely oppose stockholder proposals subverting vote outcomes historically these practices have allowed companies to describe numerous true majority votes on shareholder items as instead having failed distorting communication annual meeting votes offer the sole opportunity for most shareholders to communicate with boards counting abstentions as de facto votes against shareholder proposals management changes how outcomes are reported and how the public perceives support for shareholder concerns in contrast to how shareholder items are treated we see that amazons director election where management benefits from the appearance of strong support does not count abstentions thus management items and shareholder items do not receive equal treatment though the company has complete discretion to cure such inconsistencies in its voting policies to avert discrepancies like these the council of institutional investors has declared abstentions should be counted only for purposes of a quorum therefore support accuracy fairness and good governance at amazon by voting for simple majority vote counting on shareholder sponsored proposals end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal the board regularly reviews the companys corporate governance practices including the methodologies for how votes are cast the board has undertaken several steps to improve the companys governance practices including adopting proxy access and majority voting for directors the board does not however believe that the actions requested by the proposal represent a necessary change to the companys governance practices our vote counting practices are consistent with delaware law the companys vote counting methodology is consistent with delaware law which applies to the company by virtue of its incorporation in that state section of the delaware general corporation law provides as a default that in all matters other than the election of directors the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders because shares that vote to abstain are present and entitled to vote under this delaware law standard any shares present at the meeting that abstain from voting are essentially counted as votes against the matter our vote counting practices are fair and consistent with practices of peer companies the vote counting methodology used by the company does not inherently favor proposals submitted by the board over proposals submitted by shareholders as the vote counting standard for approving any proposal other than for the election of directors is identical thus the company applies the same vote counting standard to its own advisory votes on executive compensation for example as it does to a shareholder proposal in addition the vote counting methodology used by the company is the standard applied by a majority of our peers incorporated in delaware and according to a study by gmi ratings by a majority of sp companies changing our vote counting practices would not be in the best interests of the company all shares present in person or represented by proxy at our annual meeting are entitled to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement the board believes that it is the responsibility of any person putting a proposal forward for shareholders to approveregardless of whether the company or a shareholder proponentto persuade shareholders owning a majority of the shares that vote to support the proposal abstentions reflect the fact that a shareholder has reviewed and evaluated a proposal but has not been persuaded to support the proposal further shareholders are clearly told the effect of an abstaining vote as opposed to ignoring shareholders who abstain as the proposal would do we believe it appropriate to count abstentions as present at the annual meeting and entitled to vote and thus as relevant in determining whether a majority of the shares present have voted in favor of a proposal the effect of changing the companys vote counting methodology to completely remove abstentions from the results of a vote would be to disenfranchise those voters who chose to abstain from voting it would remove one of the voters three options as a vote to abstain itself is a position taken by a shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the board changing our vote counting practices is not necessary changing the manner in which abstentions are counted in shareholder votes would not have been determinative in any of the proposals voted on by the companys shareholders since the company went public in over that time if the proponents proposed vote counting methodology had been used it would never have increased the voting results for a proposal by more than and would never have resulted in a different outcome in terms of whether a proposal passed or failed to pass the companys vote counting methodology is both consistent with delaware law and fair to shareholders the board believes that it is important to recognize the voices of all shareholders including those who choose to abstain from voting on a particular proposal therefore the board does not believe that changing the companys vote counting methodology is in the best interests of the company the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals beneficial ownership of shares the following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common

compensation philosophy as stated in the companys letter to shareholders we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as a result we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies for example under our compensation philosophy we have prioritized stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time in addition we believe granting stock based compensation to employees at all levels across the company results in motivated customer centric people who think and act like owners because they are owners our compensation philosophy for our named executive officers identified in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our employees and is governed by the following principles first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests third our compensation program emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as a basis for compensation increases as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values including customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like owners and thinking long term a high hiring bar and frugality for our named executive officers who are employed on an at will basis we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or change in control benefits for our executive officers additionally except as noted below for rule m purposes we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to performance criteria which could cause employees to focus solely on short term returns at the expense of long term growth and innovation we believe that investing in the creation of long term value without the use of performance measures or specific indices is optimal for amazon employees particularly at the executive level and for shareholders we believe that the best measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term to help align our employees with long term value creation we compensate our employees with restricted stock unit awards that have long vesting periods over time employees will have multiple restricted stock unit awards that vest over many years and thus provide a greater amount of potential compensation in later years than the current year this encourages employees including executives to seek out develop and pursue initiatives that focus on serving our customers and reflect a long term view for thinking about our operations holistically and contributing to initiatives across the company as a company that relentlessly pursues invention across a wide range of opportunities we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize a few discrete or short term financial or operational performance measures that may narrowly focus our executives on the success of only isolated initiatives instead of on the long term success of the company as a whole for example in we could have adopted performance measures appropriate for an internet bookseller but those performance measures may have discouraged our employees from investing their time and energy into initiatives that later became aws kindle and alexa other examples of long term focus include the development of our third party seller business which was aided by the lessons learned from our unsuccessful efforts to build an auctions marketplace and when we experimented with adding services other than fast shipping to our prime membership program a performance goal assumes some level of success by a prescribed measure but to have a culture that relentlessly pursues invention we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition means we do not know in advance whether it will work in addition given the unique nature of amazon and our many initiatives standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to serve as relevant comparisons for benchmarking performance for example if we had tied compensation to our performance relative to a retail index we might never have pursued our aws business since executives would have been penalized for making the early investments in cloud technology and infrastructure that aws required similarly if we tied compensation to our performance relative to a technology index we might not have built our own devices developed our own movies and tv shows or innovated shipping and delivery methods a customized index locks in a business profile at a point in time and may deter employees from considering or pursuing initiatives that do not fit into that mold thus we think the best stock market comparison we can make is measuring our own success can we continue to grow our share value over the long term as a result we believe the best performance measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term therefore when we set our executives target compensation we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price currently so that our executives will be directly impacted if our stock price is flat or declines this approach has worked well over the past three years as our stock price has increased approximately between january and december base salaries consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for messrs blackburn jassy piacentini and wilke due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year for example because annual total compensation as reported in the summary compensation table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that year without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years a named executive officers total compensation as reported will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the senior vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of five or six years vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a change in control unless the leadership development and compensation committee determines that the acquiring company will not be assuming or substituting the awards for new hire grants and grants made in connection with internal promotions the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance including our core values and expected contributions to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price appreciation assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in april messrs olsavsky blackburn jassy and wilke received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment as follows mr olsavsky received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr olsavskys experience and skill as chief financial officer his performance in the year

performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr wilke received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr wilkes experience and skill in managing worldwide consumer operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions in setting these amounts the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet technology and media companies including alphabet apple att best buy cisco ebay facebook general electric honeywell ibm intel microsoft oracle starbucks target wal mart and the walt disney company the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data in addition messrs jassy and wilke each received an additional restricted stock unit award for shares which vest in in in and in in connection with being named ceo amazon web services and ceo worldwide consumer respectively these grants were designed to encourage long term retention and were given in recognition of their level of responsibility and expected contribution to our future success over the long term the total number of restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers during represented only i of the total number of restricted stock units granted to all employees during and ii of the weighted

of restricted stock units granted to all employees during the same three year period and ii of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the same three year period at the time of grant we impose additional vesting conditions on certain stock based awards issued to named executive officers so that the awards may qualify as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code however the company or the leadership development and compensation committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service new hire cash bonuses none of the named executive officers received a new hire cash bonus in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees we provide security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit and that the amount of the reported security expenses is especially reasonable in light of mr bezos low salary and the fact that he has never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of mr bezos security expenses reportable

shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers with more than of the votes cast for approval of our executive compensation on an advisory basis the leadership development and compensation committee evaluated the results of the advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as well as discussions we have had in recent years with our shareholders and the other factors discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis when evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices while each of these factors

ten years of the date of grant however if isos are granted to persons owning more than of the voting stock of the company the plan and the tax laws pertaining to isos provide that the exercise price may not be less than of the fair market value per share at the date of grant unless approved by shareholders the plan administrator cannot decrease the exercise price of outstanding options and cannot allow the exchange of underwater options for the grant of a new option with a lower exercise price the grant of another award or cash the option exercise price may be paid in cash or by check by tendering shares of common stock that the optionee has owned for at least six months by a broker assisted cashless exercise by any combination of the foregoing or with such other consideration as the

termination in the three month period following such cessation unless such options terminate or expire sooner by their terms in the event the optionee is terminated for cause the options terminate upon the first notification to the optionee of such termination in the event the optionee retires dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled options vested as of the date of retirement death or disability may be exercised prior to the earlier of the options specified expiration date and one year from the date of the optionees retirement death or disability in the event of a corporate transaction as defined in the plan the plan administrator will determine whether provisions will be made in connection with the corporate transaction for the assumption of the options under the plan or substitution of appropriate new options covering the stock of the successor corporation or an affiliate of the successor corporation if the plan administrator determines that no such assumption or substitution will be made each outstanding option under the plan will automatically accelerate so that it will become vested and exercisable immediately before the corporate transaction the plan does not have a fixed expiration date no isos may be granted under the plan however more than ten years after the later of i the plans adoption by the board and ii the adoption by the board of any amendment to the plan that constitutes the adoption of a new plan for purposes of section of the internal revenue code because benefits under the plan depend on the plan administrators actions and the fair market value of shares of common stock at various future dates it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by officers and other employees including french employees under the plan income tax consequences the material u s federal income tax consequences to the company and to any person granted a stock award or an option under the plan who is subject to taxation in the united states under existing applicable provisions of the internal revenue code and underlying treasury regulations are substantially as follows the following summary does not address state local or foreign tax consequences and it is based on present law and regulations as in effect as of the date hereof nsos no income will be recognized by an optionee upon the grant of an nso upon the exercise of an nso the optionee will recognize taxable ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value at the time of exercise of the shares acquired over the exercise price upon a later sale of those shares the optionee will have capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale and the tax basis of the shares sold furthermore this capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year before they are sold if payment of the option price is made entirely in cash the tax basis of the shares will be equal to their fair market value on the exercise date but not less than the exercise price and the shares holding period will begin on the day after the exercise date if the optionee uses already owned shares to pay the exercise price of an nso in whole or in part the transaction will not be considered to be a taxable disposition of the already owned shares the optionees tax basis and holding period of the already owned shares will be carried over to the equivalent number of shares received upon exercise the tax basis of the additional shares received upon exercise will be the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date but not less than the amount of cash if any used in payment and the holding period for such additional shares will begin on the day after the exercise date a isos no income will be recognized by an optionee upon the grant of an iso the rules for the tax treatment of an nso also apply to an iso that is exercised more than three months after the optionees termination of employment or more than months thereafter in the case of permanent and total disability as defined in the plan upon the exercise of an iso during employment or within three months after the optionees termination of employment months in the case of permanent and total disability for regular tax purposes the optionee will recognize no ordinary income at the time of exercise although the optionee will have income for alternative minimum income tax purposes at that time equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the exercise price if the acquired shares are sold or exchanged after the later of i one year from the date of exercise of the option and ii two years from the date of grant of the option the difference between the amount realized by the optionee on that sale or exchange and the option exercise price will be taxed to the optionee as long term capital gain or loss if the shares are disposed of in an arms length sale before such holding period requirements are satisfied then the optionee will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares received on the exercise date over the exercise price or if less the excess of the amount realized on the sale of the shares over the exercise price and the optionee will have short term or long term capital gain or loss as the case may be in an amount equal to the difference between i the amount realized by the optionee upon the disposition of the shares and ii the exercise price paid by the optionee increased by the amount of ordinary income if any so recognized by the optionee company deduction in all the foregoing cases the company will be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the participant recognizes ordinary income subject to certain limitations among these limitations is section m of the internal revenue code as discussed above certain performance based compensation is not subject to the section m limitation on deductibility stock options and restricted stock and performance share awards can qualify for this performance based exception if they meet the requirements set forth in section m and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder the plan has been drafted to allow but not require compliance with those performance based criteria finance law if shareholders approve the plan and the grant of rsus otherwise qualify under the finance law grants of qualifying rsus to french resident employees subject to the french social regime will be subject to i social taxes on the value of the rsus at the time of vesting to the extent such value is below eur and ii social taxes on the value of the rsus at the time of vesting to the extent such value exceeds eur such taxes being imposed at the time of sale of the shares underlying the rsus the vesting gain continues to be subject to progressive income tax rates that employees pay upon ultimate sale of shares received under such rsus but under the finance law can be reduced by or more if the shares are held for a specified number of years for the portion of the rsus having a value at the time of vesting below eur in addition under the finance law the employing company will be subject to a social tax upon vesting of qualifying rsus in contrast to the current social tax that is imposed upon grant of rsus and is not refunded if rsus are subsequently forfeited before vesting the tax consequences of qualifying rsus to french resident employees may vary with respect to individual situations income tax laws regulations and interpretations thereof change frequently participants should rely upon their own tax advisors for advice concerning the specific tax consequences applicable to them including the applicability and effect of state local and foreign tax laws a amazon com important annual meeting information using a black ink pen mark
