approve on an advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis the summary compensation table and the related compensation tables and narrative our executive compensation programs are designed to support our long term success as described in the compensation discussion and analysis section of this proxy statement the leadership development and compensation committee has structured our executive compensation program to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price we urge shareholders to read the compensation discussion and analysis which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives as well as the summary compensation table and related compensation tables and narrative which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers the leadership development and compensation committee and the board of directors believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the compensation discussion and analysis are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our named executive officers reported in this proxy statement has supported and contributed to our success this item is being presented pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act although this advisory vote is not binding the leadership development and compensation committee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program the board of directors recommends a vote for approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement item advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation pursuant to section a of the exchange act we are asking shareholders to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation shareholders may specify whether they prefer such votes to occur every year every two years or every three years or they may abstain the board recommends that such vote occur every three years but shareholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the boards recommendation although the vote is not binding the board will consider the voting results in determining the frequency of future advisory votes notwithstanding the boards recommendation and the outcome of the shareholder vote the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoption of material changes to compensation programs the board of directors recommends that future advisory votes on executive compensation occur every three years because our executive compensation programs are designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years shareholders should evaluate how our programs perform over the long term also an advisory vote every three years provides an appropriate period for the leadership development and compensation committee and the board to evaluate the results of the most recent advisory vote on executive compensation and to develop and implement any appropriate adjustments to our executive compensation programs conducting an advisory vote every three years would provide shareholders a meaningful opportunity to provide regular feedback and sufficient time for us to respond to it the

ownership threshold for calling a special meeting of shareholders james mcritchie yorkship court elk grove ca a shareholder who as of october owned shares of amazon com common stock has notified us of his intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by james mcritchie resolved shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary unilaterally to the fullest extent permitted by law to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders of outstanding common stock or the lowest percentage permitted by law above the power to call a special shareowner meeting this includes that such bylaw and or charter text will not have any exclusionary or prohibitive language to the fullest extent permitted by law in regard to calling a special meeting that apply only to shareowners but not to management and or the board special meetings allow shareowners to vote on important matters such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings if shareowners cannot call special meetings management may become insulated and investor returns may suffer shareowner input on the timing of shareowner meetings is especially important during a major restructuringwhen events unfold quickly and issues may become moot by the next annual meeting this proposal does not impact our boards current power to call a special meeting this proposal topic won more than support at cvs caremark sprint nextel safeway motorola and r r donnelley the merit of this special shareowner meeting proposal should also be considered in the context of the need for additional improvement in our companys reported corporate governance status patricia stonesifer and tom alberg who together were of our executive pay committee each had more then years director tenureindependence concern mr alberg also chaired our audit committee in addition directors stonesifer and alberg attracted our highest negative votes the next highest negative votes were for thomas ryder our lead director who is also of our audit committee all our other directors received far less negative votes our board was the only major corporate directorship for alain monie patricia stonesifer tom alberg and william gordon this could indicate a significant lack of current transferable director experience we had no shareholder right to proxy access cumulative voting shareholder written consent or an independent board chairman please encourage our board to respond positively to this proposal to initiate the improved corporate governance and financial performance that we deserve special shareowner meetingsyes on end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by james mcritchie recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal first while the board agrees that it is important for shareholders to have the ability to call special shareholder meetings our certificate of incorporation and bylaws already provide for this right and establish an ownership threshold for calling a special meeting at of the shares entitled to vote also shareholders with even minimal holdings can present proposals at annual meetings and suggest director nominees to the nominating and corporate governance committee in light of these existing shareholder rights the board believes that lowering the ownership threshold for calling special shareholder meetings is not necessary second special shareholder meetings involve expense and take up the time and energy of the board and management and a low ownership threshold for calling special shareholder meetings exposes us to a greater likelihood of being subjected to unnecessary expense and disruption third a low ownership threshold could expose shareholders to the risk of special meetings being called by a few shareholders focused on narrow or short term interests rather than the long term best interests of amazon com and shareholders generally for example event driven hedge funds could use special meetings to disrupt our business or to facilitate self serving financial strategies by setting the ownership threshold for calling a special meeting at no single shareholder can call a special meeting due to dispersion of ownership finally the vast majority of sp companies that allow shareholders to call special meetings have an ownership threshold greater than the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding the ownership threshold for calling a special meeting of shareholders item shareholder proposal regarding an assessment and report concerning climate change calvert asset management company montgomery avenue bethesda maryland acting on behalf of calvert funds that as of december owned at least shares of amazon com common stock has notified us of its intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting first affirmative financial network llc mark dabling boulevard suite colorado springs colorado acting on behalf of shareholders that as of december owned at least shares of amazon com common stock is a co sponsor of the calvert asset management shareholder proposal the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by calvert asset management resolution to amazon com inc whereas in the intergovernmental panel on climate changes fourth assessment report stated it is very likely that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have heavily contributed to climate change furthermore there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels whereas the stern review on the economics of climate change led by the former chief economist at the world bank estimates that if we dont act the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least of global gdp each year now and forever yet investment of global gdp each year is enough for appropriate mitigation whereas in acclimatise a risk management firm reported that climate related impacts will be felt throughout a companys business model with consequences for its raw materials supply chains essential utilities assets and operations markets customers and products its workforce and the communities in which it is located whereas increasingly investors believe that there is an intersection between climate change and corporate financial performance goldman sachs reported in may we find that while many companies acknowledge the challenges climate change presents there are significant differences in the extent to which companies are taking action differences in the effectiveness of response across industries create opportunities to lose or establish competitive advantage which we believe will prove increasingly important to investment performance whereas the carbon disclosure project cdp representing institutional investors with assets of more than trillion under management requested corporations to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate related risks in february currently amazon com inc does not respond to the cdp questionnaire whereas sp companies and global companies have responded to the cdp including ebay inc apple inc and target corp the cdp publicly cites amazon com inc as being among the u s and global companies with largest market capitalization that do not respond to the climate change survey whereas companies such as apple inc disclose information regarding the environmental footprint including greenhouse gas emissions of major electronic products amazon com currently discloses no such information regarding the kindle self described by the company as its best selling product resolved shareholders request that within months of the annual meeting the board of directors provide a report to shareholders prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information describing how amazon com inc is assessing the impact of climate change on the corporation and the corporations plans to publicly disclose this assessment end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by calvert asset management recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we are aware of and are focused on the potential impacts of climate change but we do not believe that preparing an ad hoc climate change report is an efficient use of time and resources we believe that e commerce is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional retailing and we believe that we will continue to innovate in this area over time also in part due to our focus on climate change amazon has undertaken a variety of green initiatives throughout the business including environmentally friendly packaging for products printing on demand which eliminates excess inventory earth kaizen projects throughout the business that identify waste and design solutions that are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly and various green building design initiatives all as described in more detail in the amazon and our planet section of our website the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding an assessment and report concerning climate change beneficial ownership of shares the

includes shares beneficially owned by other executive officers not individually listed in the table of which shares are issuable under stock based awards that are scheduled to vest within days after february executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis our approach to compensating employees including our named executive officers is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price named executive officers are our i chief executive officer ii chief financial officer and iii other three most highly compensated executive officers based on sec regulations our named executive officers are employed on an at will basis and named executive officer compensation generally consists of stock based compensation base salaries new hire cash bonuses and other compensation and benefits consistent with this approach we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or single trigger change in control benefits for our executive officers stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis in the named executive officers other than mr bezos each received over of their total compensation in the form of equity awards due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership approximately he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon com since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of four to six years for new hire grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining amazon com the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon com the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance and expected contributions to our future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus the projected value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in april messrs szkutak jassy piacentini and wilke received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment mr szkutak received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr szkutaks experience and skill as chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr jassy received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr jassys experience and skill in managing web services and cloud computing operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr piacentini received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr piacentinis experience and skill in managing international retail operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr wilke received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr wilkes experience and skill in managing north american retail operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions in setting these amounts the leadership development and compensation committee also considered aggregated market information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet and technology companies including adobe systems aol best buy bmc software cisco dell ebay gap ibm intel intuit microsoft oracle sun target and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data we have imposed additional vesting conditions designed to qualify these awards along with certain other awards issued in previous years to named executive officers as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code base salaries consistent with our belief that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid by similarly situated companies base salaries for named executive officers remained flat during compared to and ranged from for mr bezos to for mr piacentini base salaries were for the other named executive officers due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon com mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount new hire cash bonuses new hire cash bonuses generally are paid in monthly installments to a named executive officer these bonuses are also determined by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the chief executive officer and the vice president of human resources in determining the amount of new hire cash bonuses the leadership development and compensation committee considers the same factors as described above with respect to new hire restricted stock unit grants the new hire cash bonuses are for a set amount determined at hire and are generally designed to provide appropriate total compensation until stock based compensation begins to vest at which time total compensation becomes variable and largely tied to long term shareholder value none of the named executive officers received new hire cash bonuses in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees we provide security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit and we believe that the amount of the reported security expenses is especially reasonable in light of mr bezos low salary and the fact that he has never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of mr bezos security expenses reportable security expenses along with mr piacentinis expatriation benefits including a cost of living and housing allowance are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers leadership development and compensation committee report the leadership development and compensation committee which is composed solely of independent members of the board of directors assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to among other things establishing and reviewing compensation of the companys executive officers the leadership
