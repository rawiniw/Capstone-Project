networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events anddisruptions from natural or man made disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities labor or trade disputes and similar events our international operations expose us to a number of risksour international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts table of contentslower levels of use of the internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the u s lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employee employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable u s and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties laws and policies of the u s and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes andgeopolitical events including war and terrorism as international physical e commerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth the peoples republic of china prc and india regulate amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in china through contractual relationships with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi brand retail trading activities for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third party sellers on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely we face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centersfailures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipments we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers the inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or man made disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events table of contentsthe seasonality of our retail business places increased strain on our operationswe expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth when we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades split shipments and additional long zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances our commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships expose us to riskswe provide physical e commerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and third party software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales therefore when the other companys offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results our present and future e commerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships anddifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements our business suffers when we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investmentswe have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions table of contentsthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investees financial performance into our financial results for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest andfor foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other than temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results we have foreign exchange riskthe results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents and or marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds euros and japanese yen when the u s dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our businesswe depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policies we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business we could be harmed by data loss or other security breachesbecause we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors or customers technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation regulatory action including under privacy or data protection laws and potential liability for us deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers back office support and other functions some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and table of contentsalthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancywe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or man made disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy we face significant inventory riskin addition to risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and or sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results we face risks related to adequately protecting our intellectual property rights and being accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third partieswe regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims table of contentsour digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatilewe have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item a as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet related companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other e commerce or technology companies andtransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our businesswe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical e commerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell these regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile

operation of unmanned aircraft systems and other matters it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel data protection and personal privacy apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet e commerce digital content web services electronic devices and artificial intelligence technologies and services a large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand we are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations for example the european commission announced that it has opened an investigation to assess whether aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate eu competition rules unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operationsas an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy and data protection consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters the number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people any of these types of table of contentsproceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors the outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of non infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations we face additional tax liabilities and collection obligationswe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the u s federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions we may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenue based taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services these include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations for example the european union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies in some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example the legislation known as the u s tax cuts and jobs act of the u s tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by u s tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the u s tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the u s treasury department the irs and other standard setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the u s tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made we are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals our supplier relationships subject us to a number of riskswe have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or single sources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have long term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits decisions by our current suppliers to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual table of contentsterms intellectual property rights of others or our supply chain standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results we are subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulationsour contracts with u s as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition some of these contracts provide for termination by the government at any time without cause we are subject to product liability claims when people or property are harmed by the products we sell or manufacturesome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to product liability claims such as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability we are subject to payments related riskswe accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazon branded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer co branded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected in addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellersthe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling table of contentsgoods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies when these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers under our a z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our third party seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results item b unresolved staff commentsnone table of contentsitem propertiesas of december we

our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in item a of parti risk factors overviewour primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers the products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third party sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third party sellers as service sales we seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions our financial focus is on long term sustainable growth in free cash flows free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longer term strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service

variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture see results of operations non gaap financial measures below for additional information on our non gaap free cash flows financial measures working capital consists of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable table of contentsbecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash generating operating cycle on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by third party sellers our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize third party fulfillment providers we also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by third party sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross functionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the advances of wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes we seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model alignsthe long term interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were million and million as of december and our financial reporting currency is the u s dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends for example if the u s dollar weakens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the u s dollar strengthens year over year relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the u s economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results

principles of the united states gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companysfinancial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note description of business and accounting policies although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions inventoriesinventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write downs in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately million in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs income taxeswe are subject to income taxes in the u s federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions in addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the u s tax reform legislation commonly known as the u s tax cuts and jobs act of the u s tax act finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the u s tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations the u s tax act significantly changed how the u s taxes corporations the u s tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by u s tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the u s tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the u s treasury department the irs and other standard setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the u s tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made we are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals table of contentsrecent accounting pronouncementssee item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note description of

value were billion and billion as of december and amounts held in foreign currencies were billion and billion as of december and and were primarily euros british pounds and japanese yen cash provided by used in operating activities was billion and billion in and our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our long term obligations cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow in compared to the prior year is primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non cash charges such as depreciation amortization and stock based compensation cash provided by used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates cash provided by used in investing

other and were billion and billion in and property and equipment acquired under finance leases was billion and billion in and with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business

primarily equipment through cash taxes paid net of refunds were billion and million for and as of december we had approximately billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities our federal tax credits are primarily related to the u s federal research and development credit as we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase we endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis in connection with the european commissions october decision against us on state aid luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the european commissions decision of approximately million that we deposited into escrow in march subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases amounts due to third party sellers in certain jurisdictions debt and standby and trade letters of credit to the extent we process payments for third party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash which is classified within accounts receivable net and other and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december and restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million see item of

purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant non inventory commitments were billion as of december these purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item a of part i risk factors we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at

product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were billion and billion in and we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better

centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as technology and content fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize fulfillment by amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from

continue to add employees and technology infrastructure these costs are allocated to segments based on usage the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings we expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our

social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling

reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion critical audit matterthe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and

critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates uncertain tax positionsdescription of the matterthe company is subject to income taxes in the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions and as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements during the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain as a result significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes the company uses significant judgment in determining whether a tax positions technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition as of december the company accrued liabilities of billion for various tax contingencies auditing the measurement of the companys tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex involves significant judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings table of contentshow we addressed the matter in our auditwe tested controls over the companys process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies including controls over the assessment as to

subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the u s in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors we utilize a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions tax contingencies the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date to increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value level valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets level valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data level valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants these valuations require significant judgment for our cash cash equivalents or marketable securities we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data we did not hold significant amounts of cash cash equivalents restricted cash or marketable securities categorized as level assets as of december and we hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies as of december and these warrants had a fair value of million and million and are recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets these assets are primarily classified as level assets cash and cash equivalentswe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents table of contentsinventoriesinventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category we provide fulfillment by amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs third party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third party sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories we also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm non cancellable commitments these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs we also have firm non cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our whole foods market stores accounts receivable net and otherincluded in accounts receivable net and other on our

billion and seller receivables net were million and million seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure

all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement the allowance for doubtful accounts was million million and million as of december and additions to the

arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment heavy equipment and other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of years or the remaining life of the underlying building three years for our servers five years for networking equipment ten years for heavy equipment and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations leaseswe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment net all other leases are categorized as operating leases our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance for leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease for substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand alone prices table of contentslease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from other assets upon lease commencement leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term when we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term the interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs financing obligationswe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build to suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period if we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease the building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation if we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as either operating or finance goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a two step impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the two step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions we completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of april and determined that goodwill is not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value there were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test see note acquisitions goodwill and acquired intangible assets other assetsincluded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization video and music content net of accumulated

inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules when the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed we reduce the liability as payments are made and we table of contentsamortize the asset to cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straight line basis if the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred we also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content the weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is years our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer amazon prime memberships these film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value the total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of december and were billion and billion total video and music expense was billion and billion for the year ended december and total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within amazon prime memberships and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content investmentswe generally invest our excess cash in aaa rated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee equity method investments are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity method investees amortization of basis differences and related gains or losses if any are classified as equity method investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations as of december and these investments had a carrying value of million and billion equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of operations we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment for debt securities and equity method investments we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other than temporary this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs additionally we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis factors considered include quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities credit quality of debt instrument issuers other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment long lived assetslong lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable for long lived assets used in operations including lease assets impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probability weighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value long lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell assets held for sale were not significant as of december and table of contentsaccrued expenses

million million and million in and accounting pronouncements recently adoptedin may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we adopted this asu on january for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately million the adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote we changed the recognition and classification of amazon prime memberships which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales previously prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales and sales of apps in app content and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy the impact of applying this asu for the year ended december primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of prime membership fees of approximately billion service sales also increased by approximately billion for the year ended december due to the reclassification of certain advertising services table of contentsin january the fasb issued an asu that updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments under this asu certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income we adopted this asu in q with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements in february the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for leases primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets under the new guidance leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations respectively we adopted this asu on january by recording an immaterial cumulative

periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date to increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value level valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets level valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data level valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants these valuations require significant judgment for our cash cash equivalents or marketable securities we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data we did not hold significant amounts of cash cash equivalents restricted cash or marketable securities categorized as level assets as of december and we hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies as of december and these warrants had a fair value of million and million and are recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets these assets are primarily classified as level assets cash and cash equivalentswe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents inventoriesinventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category we provide fulfillment by amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs third party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third party sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories we also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm non cancellable commitments these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs we also have firm non cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our whole foods market stores accounts receivable net and otherincluded in accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers vendors and sellers as of december and customer receivables net were billion and billion vendor receivables net were billion and billion and seller receivables net were million and million seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory we estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred receivables are considered impaired and written off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement the allowance for doubtful accounts was million million and million as of december and additions to the allowance were million million and billion and deductions to the allowance were million million and million in and software development costswe incur software development costs related to products to be sold leased or marketed to external users internal use software and our websites software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented all other costs including those related to design or maintenance are expensed as incurred property and equipment netproperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs property includes buildings and land that we own along with property we have acquired under build to suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment heavy equipment and other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of years or the remaining life of the underlying building three years for our servers five years for networking equipment ten years for heavy equipment and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations leaseswe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment net all other leases are categorized as operating leases our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance for leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease for substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand alone prices lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from other assets upon lease commencement leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term when we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term the interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs financing obligationswe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build to suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period if we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease the building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation if we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as either operating or finance goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a two step impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the two step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions we completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of april and determined that goodwill is not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value there were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test see note acquisitions goodwill and acquired intangible assets other assetsincluded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization video and music content net of accumulated amortization long term deferred tax assets certain equity investments marketable securities restricted for longer than one year the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement and equity warrant assets digital video and music contentwe obtain video content inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules when the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed we reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straight line basis if the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred we also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content the weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is years our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer amazon prime memberships these film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value the total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of december and were billion and billion total video and music expense was billion and billion for the year ended december and total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within amazon prime memberships and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content investmentswe generally invest our excess cash in aaa rated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee equity method investments are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity method investees amortization of basis differences and related gains or losses if any are classified as equity method investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations as of december and these investments had a carrying value of million and billion equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of operations we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment for debt securities and equity method investments we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other than temporary this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs additionally we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis factors considered include quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities credit quality of debt instrument issuers other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment long lived assetslong lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable for long lived assets used in operations including lease assets impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probability weighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value long lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell assets held for sale were not significant as of december and accrued expenses and otherincluded in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations payroll and related expenses unredeemed gift cards customer liabilities current debt acquired digital media content and other operating expenses as of december and our liabilities for payroll related expenses were billion and billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were billion and billion we reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer the portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns unearned revenueunearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of aws services and amazon prime memberships our total unearned revenue as of december was billion of which billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended december and our total unearned revenue as of december was billion included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was billion and billion of unearned revenue as of december and additionally we have performance obligations primarily related to aws associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements for contracts with original terms that exceed one year those commitments not yet recognized were billion as of december the weighted average remaining life of our long term contracts is years however the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage which can extend beyond the original contractual term other long term liabilitiesincluded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities financing obligations asset retirement obligations tax contingencies and digital video and music content foreign currencywe have internationally focused stores for which the net sales generated as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations are denominated in local functional currencies the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into u s dollars at period end foreign exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of stockholders equity and in the foreign currency effect on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations in connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances we recorded gains losses of million million and million in and accounting pronouncements recently adoptedin may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we adopted this asu on january for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately million the adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote we changed the recognition and classification of amazon prime memberships which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales previously prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales and sales of apps in app content and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy the impact of applying this asu for the year ended december primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of prime membership fees of approximately billion service sales also increased by approximately billion for the year ended december due to the reclassification of certain advertising services in january the fasb issued an asu that updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments under this asu certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income we adopted this asu in q with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements in february the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for leases primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets under the new guidance leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations respectively we adopted this asu on january by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption the adoption of this asu resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately billion which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of billion as of december amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled billion of which billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and billion and billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases respectively in october the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for income taxes the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer other than transfers of inventory when the transfer occurs for intercompany transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party we adopted this asu in q with an increase of approximately million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances in november the fasb issued an asu amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows the new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows we adopted this asu in q on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions year ended december previously reportedadjustmentsas revisedoperating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash in march the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for film costs inclusive of episodic television and movie costs the new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized previously we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content we adopted this asu as of january and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs adoption of this asu resulted in approximately billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in other assets as of december x referencesno definition available details name us gaap

treasury stock method in periods when we have a net loss stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect revenue revenuerevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive reduced by estimates for return allowances promotional discounts and rebates revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties including sales and indirect taxes in arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand alone selling price we generally determine stand alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin a description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows retail sales we offer consumer products through our online and physical stores revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third party carrier or in the case of an amazon delivery to the customer third party seller services we offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us we are not the seller of record in these transactions the commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third party carrier or in the case of an amazon delivery to the customer subscription services our subscription sales include fees associated with amazon prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks digital video digital music e books and other non aws subscription services prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand ready obligation subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period aws our aws arrangements include global sales of compute storage database and other services revenue is allocated to services using stand alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services based on the quantity of services rendered such as compute or storage capacity delivered on demand certain services including compute and database are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term for which revenue is recognized ratably sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term other other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions return allowances return allowances which reduce revenue and cost of sales are estimated using historical experience

and related transaction costs including those associated with seller transactions are classified in fulfillment on our consolidated statements of operations vendor agreementswe have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts promotions incentives and volume rebates we generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods including property and equipment or services and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory cost of services or cost of property and equipment volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds we evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts when volume rebates can be reasonably estimated we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold fulfillment fulfillmentfulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international segments fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers including costs attributable to buying receiving inspecting and warehousing inventories picking packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment payment processing and related transaction costs including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller

recognized over the service period the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including historical forfeiture experience and employee level other operating expense net other operating expense income netother operating expense income net consists primarily of marketing related contract based and customer related intangible asset amortization expense and expenses related to legal settlements other income expense net other income expense netother income expense net consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of million million and million in and equity warrant valuation gains losses of million million and million in and income taxes income taxesincome tax expense includes u s federal and state and foreign income taxes certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to u s taxation under the u s tax act which also repeals u s taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings we intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the u s in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors we utilize a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions tax contingencies the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense fair value of financial instruments fair value of financial instrumentsfair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date to increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value level valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets level valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data level valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants these valuations require significant judgment for our cash cash equivalents or marketable securities we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data we did not hold significant amounts of cash cash equivalents restricted cash or marketable securities categorized as level assets as of december and we hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies as of december and these warrants had a fair value of million and million and are recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets these assets are primarily classified as level assets cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalentswe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents inventories inventoriesinventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category we provide fulfillment by amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs third party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third party sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories we also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm non cancellable commitments these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs we also have firm non cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our whole foods market stores accounts receivable net and other accounts receivable net and otherincluded in accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers vendors and sellers as of december and customer receivables net were billion and billion vendor receivables net were billion and billion and seller receivables net were million and million seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory we estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred receivables are considered impaired and written off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement software development costs software development costswe incur software development costs related to products to be sold leased or marketed to external users internal use software and our websites software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented all other costs including those related to design or maintenance are expensed as incurred property and equipment net property and equipment netproperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs property includes buildings and land that we own along with property we have acquired under build to suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment heavy equipment and other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of years or the remaining life of the underlying building three years for our servers five years for networking equipment ten years for heavy equipment and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations leases leaseswe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment net all other leases are categorized as operating leases our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance for leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease for substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand alone prices lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from other assets upon lease commencement leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term when we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term the interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs financing obligations financing obligationswe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build to suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period if we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease the building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation if we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as either operating or finance goodwill goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a two step impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the two step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions we completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of april and determined that goodwill is not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value there were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test other assets other assetsincluded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization video and music content net of accumulated amortization long term deferred tax assets certain equity investments marketable securities restricted for longer than one year the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement and equity warrant assets video and music content digital video and music contentwe obtain video content inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules when the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed we reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straight line basis if the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred we also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content the weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is years our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer amazon prime memberships these film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value the total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of december and were billion and billion total video and music expense was billion and billion for the year ended december and total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within amazon prime memberships and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content investments investmentswe generally invest our excess cash in aaa rated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediate term fixed income securities such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee equity method investments are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity method investees amortization of basis differences and related gains or losses if any are classified as equity method investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations as of december and these investments had a carrying value of million and billion equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of operations we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment for debt securities and equity method investments we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other than temporary this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs additionally we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis factors considered include quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities credit quality of debt instrument issuers other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment long lived assets long lived assetslong lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable for long lived assets used in operations including lease assets impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probability weighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value long lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell accrued expenses and other accrued expenses and otherincluded in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations payroll and related expenses unredeemed gift cards customer liabilities current debt acquired digital media content and other operating expenses as of december and our liabilities for payroll related expenses were billion and billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were billion and billion we reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer the portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns unearned revenue unearned revenueunearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of aws services and amazon prime memberships our total unearned revenue as of december was billion of which billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended december and our total unearned revenue as of december was billion included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was billion and billion of unearned revenue as of december and additionally we have performance obligations primarily related to aws associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements for contracts with original terms that exceed one year those commitments not yet recognized were billion as of december the weighted average remaining life of our long term contracts is years however the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage which can extend beyond the original contractual term other long term liabilities other long term liabilitiesincluded in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities financing obligations asset retirement obligations tax contingencies and digital video and music content foreign currency foreign currencywe have internationally focused stores for which the net sales generated as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations are denominated in local functional currencies the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into u s dollars at period end foreign exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of stockholders equity and in the foreign currency effect on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations accounting pronouncements recently adopted and accounting pronouncements not yet adopted accounting pronouncements recently adoptedin may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers we adopted this asu on january for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately million the adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote we changed the recognition and classification of amazon prime memberships which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales previously prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales and sales of apps in app content and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy the impact of applying this asu for the year ended december primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of prime membership fees of approximately billion service sales also increased by approximately billion for the year ended december due to the reclassification of certain advertising services in january the fasb issued an asu that updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments under this asu certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income we adopted this asu in q with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements in february the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for leases primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets under the new guidance leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations respectively we adopted this asu on january by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption the adoption of this asu resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately billion which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of billion as of december amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled billion of which billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and billion and billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases respectively in october the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for income taxes the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer other than transfers of inventory when the transfer occurs for intercompany transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party we adopted this asu in q with an increase of approximately million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances in november the fasb issued an asu amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows the new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows we adopted this asu in q on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions year ended december previously reportedadjustmentsas revisedoperating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash in march the fasb issued an asu amending the accounting for film costs inclusive of episodic television and movie costs the new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized previously we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content we adopted this asu as of january and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs adoption of this asu resulted in approximately billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in other assets as of
