customers love it it can grow to very large size it has strong returns on capital and its durable in time with the potential to endure for decades when you find one of these dont just swipe right get married well im pleased to report that amazon hasnt been monogamous in this regard after two decades of risk taking and teamwork and with generous helpings of good fortune all along the way we are now happily wed to what i believe are three such life partners marketplace prime and aws each of these offerings was a bold bet at first and sensible people worried often that they could not work but at this point its become pretty clear how special they are and how lucky we are to have them its also clear that there are no sinecures in business we know its our job to always nourish and fortify them well approach the job with our usual tools customer obsession rather than competitor focus heartfelt passion for invention commitment to operational excellence and a willingness to think long term with good execution and a bit of continuing good luck marketplace prime and aws can be serving customers and earning financial returns for many years to come marketplace marketplaces early days were not easy first we launched amazon auctions i think seven people came if you count my parents and siblings auctions transformed into zshops which was basically a fixed price version of auctions again no customers but then we morphed zshops into marketplace internally marketplace was known as sdp for single detail page the idea was to take our most valuable retail real estate our product detail pages and let third party sellers compete against our own retail category managers it was more convenient for customers and within a year it accounted for of units today more than of our units are sold by more than two million third party sellers worldwide customers ordered more than two billion units from sellers in the success of this hybrid model accelerated the amazon flywheel customers were initially drawn by our fast growing selection of amazon sold products at great prices with a great customer experience by then allowing third parties to offer products side by side we became more attractive to customers which drew even more sellers this also added to our economies of scale which we passed along by lowering prices and eliminating shipping fees for qualifying orders having introduced these programs in the u s we rolled them out as quickly as we could to our other geographies the result was a marketplace that became seamlessly integrated with all of our global websites we work hard to reduce the workload for sellers and increase the success of their businesses through our selling coach program we generate a steady stream of automated machine learned nudges more than million in a typical week alerting sellers about opportunities to avoid going out of stock add selection thats selling and sharpen their prices to be more competitive these nudges translate to billions in increased sales to sellers to further globalize marketplace were now helping sellers in each of our geographies and in countries where we dont have a presence reach out to our customers in countries outside their home geographies we hosted merchants from more than different countries last year and helped them connect with customers in nations almost one fifth of our overall third party sales now occur outside the sellers home countries and our merchants cross border sales nearly doubled last year in the eu sellers can open a single account manage their business in multiple languages and make products available across our five eu websites more recently weve started consolidating cross border shipments for sellers and helping them obtain ocean shipping from asia to europe and north america at preferential bulk rates marketplace is the heart of our fast growing operations in india since all of our selection in india is offered by third party sellers amazon in now offers more selection than any other e commerce site in india with more than million products offered from over sellers with our easy ship service we pick up products from a seller and handle delivery all the way to the end customer building upon easy ship the india team recently piloted kirana now a service that delivers everyday essentials from local kirana mom and pop stores to customers in two to four hours adding convenience for our customers and increasing sales for the stores participating in the service perhaps most important for sellers weve created fulfillment by amazon but ill save that for after we discuss prime amazon prime ten years ago we launched amazon prime originally designed as an all you can eat free and fast shipping program we were told repeatedly that it was a risky move and in some ways it was in its first year we gave up many millions of dollars in shipping revenue and there was no simple math to show that it would be worth it our decision to go ahead was built on the positive results wed seen earlier when we introduced free super saver shipping and an intuition that customers would quickly grasp that they were being offered the best deal in the history of shopping in addition analysis told us that if we achieved scale we would be able to significantly lower the cost of fast shipping our owned inventory retail business was the foundation of prime in addition to creating retail teams to build each of our category specific online stores we have created large scale systems to automate much of inventory replenishment inventory placement and product pricing the precise delivery date promise of prime required operating our fulfillment centers in a new way and pulling all of this together is one of the great accomplishments of our global operations team our worldwide network of fulfillment centers has expanded from in when we launched prime to this year we are now on our eighth generation of fulfillment center design employing proprietary software to manage receipt stowing picking and shipment amazon robotics which began with our acquisition of kiva in has now deployed more than robots to support the stowing and retrieval of products at a higher density and lower cost than ever before our owned inventory retail business remains our best customer acquisition vehicle for prime and a critical part of building out categories that attract traffic and third party sellers though fast delivery remains a core prime benefit we are finding new ways to pump energy into prime two of the most important are digital and devices in we added prime instant video as a benefit now with tens of thousands of movies and tv episodes available for unlimited streaming in the u s and weve started expanding the program into the u k and germany as well were investing a significant amount on this content and its important that we monitor its impact we ask ourselves is it worth it is it driving prime among other things we watch prime free trial starts conversion to paid membership renewal rates and product purchase rates by members entering through this channel we like what we see so far and plan to keep investing here while most of our piv spend is on licensed content were also starting to develop original content the team is off to a strong start our show transparent became the first from a streaming service to win a golden globe for best series and tumble leaf won the annie for best animated series for preschoolers in addition to the critical acclaim the numbers are promising an advantage of our original programming is that its first run is on prime it hasnt already appeared anywhere else together with the quality of the shows that first run status appears to be one of the factors leading to the attractive numbers we also like the fixed cost nature of original programming we get to spread that fixed cost across our large membership base finally our business model for original content is unique im pretty sure were the first company to have figured out how to make winning a golden globe pay off in increased sales of power tools and baby wipes amazon designed and manufactured devices from kindle to fire tv to echo also pump energy into prime services such as prime instant video and prime music and generally drive higher engagement with every element of the amazon ecosystem and theres more to come our device team has a strong and exciting roadmap ahead prime isnt done improving on its original fast and free shipping promise either the recently launched prime now offers prime members free two hour delivery on tens of thousands of items or one hour delivery for a fee lots of early reviews read like this one in the past six weeks my husband and i have made an embarrassing number of orders through amazon prime now its cheap easy and insanely fast weve launched in manhattan brooklyn miami baltimore dallas atlanta and austin and more cities are coming soon now id like to talk about fulfillment by amazon fba is so important because it is glue that inextricably links marketplace and prime thanks to fba marketplace and prime are no longer two things in fact at this point i cant really think about them separately their economics and customer experiences are now happily and deeply intertwined fba is a service for marketplace sellers when a seller decides to use fba they stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers we take on all logistics customer service and product returns if a customer orders an fba item and an amazon owned inventory item we can ship both items to the customer in one box a huge efficiency gain but even more important when a seller joins fba their items can become prime eligible maintaining a firm grasp of the obvious is more difficult than one would think it should be but its useful to try if you ask what do sellers want the correct and obvious answer is they want more sales so what happens when sellers join fba and their items become prime eligible they get more sales notice also what happens from a prime members point of view every time a seller joins fba prime members get more prime eligible selection the value of membership goes up this is powerful for our flywheel fba completes the circle marketplace pumps energy into prime and prime pumps energy into marketplace in a survey of u s sellers of fba merchants reported more than a increase in unit sales after joining fba in the holiday period worldwide fba units shipped grew over the prior year and represented more than of paid third party units paid prime memberships grew more than in the u s last year and worldwide fba is a win for customers and a win for sellers amazon web services a radical idea when it was launched nine years ago amazon web services is now big and growing fast startups were the early adopters on demand pay as you go cloud storage and compute resources dramatically increased the speed of starting a new business companies like pinterest dropbox and airbnb all used aws services and remain customers today since then large enterprises have been coming on board as well and theyre choosing to use aws for the same primary reason the startups did speed and agility having lower it cost is attractive and sometimes the absolute cost savings can be enormous but cost savings alone could never overcome deficiencies in performance or functionality enterprises are dependent on it its mission critical so the proposition i can save you a significant amount on your annual it bill and my service is almost as good as what you have now wont get too many customers what customers really want in this arena is better and faster and if better and faster can come with a side dish of cost savings terrific but the cost savings is the gravy not the steak it is so high leverage you dont want to imagine a competitor whose it department is more nimble than yours every company has a list of technology projects that the business would like to see implemented as soon as possible the painful reality is that tough triage decisions are always made and many projects never get done even those that get resourced are often delivered late or with incomplete functionality if an it department can figure out how to deliver a larger number of business enabling technology projects faster theyll be creating significant and real value for their organization these are the main reasons aws is growing so quickly it departments are recognizing that when they adopt aws they get more done they spend less time on low value add activities like managing datacenters networking operating system patches capacity planning database scaling and so on and so on just as important they get access to powerful apis and tools that dramatically simplify building scalable secure robust high performance systems and those apis and tools are continuously and seamlessly upgraded behind the scenes without customer effort today aws has more than a million active customers as companies and organizations of all sizes use aws in every imaginable business segment aws usage grew by approximately in the fourth quarter of versus the prior year companies like ge major league baseball tata motors and qantas are building new applications on aws these range from apps for crowdsourcing and personalized healthcare to mobile apps for managing fleets of trucks other customers like ntt docomo the financial times and the securities and exchange commission are using aws to analyze and take action on vast amounts of data and many customers like cond nast kelloggs and news corp are migrating legacy critical applications and in some cases entire datacenters to aws weve increased our pace of innovation as weve gone along from nearly new features and services in to in and last year there are many that would be interesting to talk about from workdocs and workmail to aws lambda and the ec container service to the aws marketplace but for purposes of brevity im going to limit myself to one our recently introduced amazon aurora we hope aurora will offer customers a new normal for a very important but also very problematic technology that is a critical underpinning of many applications the relational database aurora is a mysql compatible database engine that offers the speed and availability of high end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost effectiveness of open source databases auroras performance is up to x better than typical mysql databases at one tenth the cost of commercial database packages relational databases is an arena thats been a pain point for organizations and developers for a long time and were very excited about aurora i believe aws is one of those dreamy business offerings that can be serving customers and earning financial returns for many years into the future why am i optimistic for one thing the size of the opportunity is big ultimately encompassing global spend on servers networking datacenters infrastructure software databases data warehouses and more similar to the way i think about amazon retail for all practical purposes i believe aws is market size unconstrained second its current leadership position which is significant is a strong ongoing advantage we work hard very hard to make aws as easy to use as possible even so its still a necessarily complex set of tools with rich functionality and a non trivial learning curve once youve become proficient at building complex systems with aws you do not want to have to learn a new set of tools and apis assuming the set you already understand works for you this is in no way something we can rest on but if we continue to serve our customers in a truly outstanding way they will have a rational preference to stick with us in addition also because of our leadership position we now have thousands of what are effectively aws ambassadors roaming the world software developers changing jobs moving from one company to another become our best sales people we used aws where i used to work and we should consider it here i think wed get more done its a good sign that proficiency with aws and its services is already something software developers are adding to their resumes finally im optimistic that aws will have strong returns on capital this is one we as a team examine because aws is capital intensive the good news is we like what we see when we do these analyses structurally aws is far less capital intensive than the mode its replacing do it yourself datacenters which have low utilization rates almost always below pooling of workloads across customers gives aws much higher utilization rates and correspondingly higher capital efficiency further once again our leadership position helps scale economies can provide us a relative advantage on capital efficiency well continue to watch and shape the business for good returns on capital aws is young and it is still growing and evolving we think we can continue to lead if we continue to execute with our customers needs foremost in mind career choice before closing i want to take a moment to update shareowners on something were excited about and proud of three years ago we launched an innovative employee benefit the career choice program where we pre pay of tuition for employees to take courses for in demand fields such as airplane mechanic or nursing regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at amazon the idea was simple enable choice we know that for some of our fulfillment and customer service center employees amazon will be a career for others amazon might be a stepping stone on the way to a job somewhere else a job that may require new skills if the right training can make the difference we want to help and so far we have been able to help over employees who have participated in the program in eight different countries theres been so much interest that we are now building onsite classrooms so college and technical classes can be taught inside our fulfillment centers making it even easier for associates to achieve these goals there are now eight fcs offering classes taught onsite in our purpose built classrooms with high end technology features and designed with glass walls to inspire others to participate and generate encouragement from peers we believe career choice is an innovative way to draw great talent to serve customers in our fulfillment and customer service centers these jobs can become gateways to great careers with amazon as we expand around the world or enable employees the opportunity to follow their passion in other in demand technical fields like our very first career choice graduate did when she started a new career as a nurse in her community i would also like to invite you to come join the more than people who have signed up so far to see the magic that happens after you click buy on amazon com by touring one of our fulfillment centers in addition to u s tours we are now offering tours at sites around the world including rugeley in the u k and graben in germany and continuing to expand you can sign up for a tour at www amazon com fctours marketplace prime and amazon web services are three big ideas were lucky to have them and were determined to improve and nurture them make them even better for customers you can also count on us to work hard to find a fourth weve already got a number of candidates in work and as we promised some twenty years ago well continue to make bold bets with the opportunities unfolding in front of us to serve customers better through invention we assure you we wont stop trying as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same because its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
