form of one or more global securities that will be deposited with or on behalf of a depository identified in the applicable prospectus supplement global securities may be issued in either registered or bearer form and in either temporary or permanent form unless otherwise provided in such prospectus supplement debt securities that are represented by a global security will be issued in denominations of or any integral multiple of in excess thereof and will be issued in registered form only without coupons we anticipate that any global securities will be deposited with or on behalf of dtc and that such global securities will be registered in the name of cedeco dtcs nominee we further anticipate that the following provisions will apply to the depository arrangements with respect to any such global securities any additional or differing terms of the depository arrangements will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of debt securities issued in the form of global securities beneficial interests in the global securities will be represented through book entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in dtc investors may elect to hold their interests in the global securities through either dtc in the united states or in europe through clearstream or through euroclear investors may hold their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems clearstream and euroclear will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers securities accounts in clearstreams and euroclears names on the books of their respective u s depositaries which in turn will hold these interests in customers securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of dtc beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in denominations of and multiples of in excess thereof except as set forth below the global securities may be transferred in whole and not in part only to another nominee of dtc or to a successor of dtc or its nominee debt securities represented by a global security can be exchanged for definitive securities in registered form only if dtc notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a successor depositary within days after receiving that notice at any time dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered or in good standing under the exchange act as amended or other applicable statute or regulation and we do not appoint a successor depositary within days after becoming aware that dtc has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency or we determine that that global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form and we notify the trustee of our decision a global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for definitive securities issued in authorized denominations in registered form for the same aggregate amount the definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by dtc we will make principal and interest payments on all debt securities represented by a global security to the paying agent which in turn will make payment to dtc or its nominee as the case may be as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the debt securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the indenture accordingly we the trustee and any paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of dtcs records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a debt security represented by a global security or table of contents any other aspect of the relationship between dtc and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants or the maintenance supervision or review of any of dtcs records relating to those beneficial ownership interests dtc has advised us that its current practice is to credit participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on dtcs records upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information the underwriters or agents for the debt securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name and will be the sole responsibility of those participants book entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note so long as dtc or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security dtc or its nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the debt securities owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in their names will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders of debt securities under the indenture accordingly each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of dtc and if that person is not a dtc participant on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities the laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form these laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account we understand that under existing industry practices if we request holders to take any action or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the indenture then dtc would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc and its participants for that global security the conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect dtc has advised us that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the new york banking law a banking organization within the meaning of the new york
