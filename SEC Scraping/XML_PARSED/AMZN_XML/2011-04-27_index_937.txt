quorum erasure coding vector clocks walk into certain amazon meetings and you may momentarily think youve stumbled into a computer science lecture look inside a current textbook on software architecture and youll find few patterns that we dont apply at amazon we use high performance transactions systems complex rendering and object caching workflow and queuing systems business intelligence and data analytics machine learning and pattern recognition neural networks and probabilistic decision making and a wide variety of other techniques and while many of our systems are based on the latest in computer science research this often hasnt been sufficient our architects and engineers have had to advance research in directions that no academic had yet taken many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions and so we happily invent new approaches our technologies are almost exclusively implemented as services bits of logic that encapsulate the data they operate on and provide hardened interfaces as the only way to access their functionality this approach reduces side effects and allows services to evolve at their own pace without impacting the other components of the overall system service oriented architecture or soa is the fundamental building abstraction for amazon technologies thanks to a thoughtful and far sighted team of engineers and architects this approach was applied at amazon long before soa became a buzzword in the industry our e commerce platform is composed of a federation of hundreds of software services that work in concert to deliver functionality ranging from recommendations to order fulfillment to inventory tracking for example to construct a product detail page for a customer visiting amazon com our software calls on between and services to present a highly personalized experience for that customer state management is the heart of any system that needs to grow to very large size many years ago amazons requirements reached a point where many of our systems could no longer be served by any commercial solution our key data services store many petabytes of data and handle millions of requests per second to meet these demanding and unusual requirements weve developed several alternative purpose built persistence solutions including our own key value store and single table store to do so weve leaned heavily on the core principles from the distributed systems and database research communities and invented from there the storage systems weve pioneered demonstrate extreme scalability while maintaining tight control over performance availability and cost to achieve their ultra scale properties these systems take a novel approach to data update management by relaxing the synchronization requirements of updates that need to be disseminated to large numbers of replicas these systems are able to survive under the harshest performance and availability conditions these implementations are based on the concept of eventual consistency the advances in data management developed by amazon engineers have been the starting point for the architectures underneath the cloud storage and data management services offered by amazon web services aws for example our simple storage service elastic block store and simpledb all derive their basic architecture from unique amazon technologies other areas of amazons business face similarly complex data processing and decision problems such as product data ingestion and categorization demand forecasting inventory allocation and fraud detection rule based systems can be used successfully but they can be hard to maintain and can become brittle over time in many cases advanced machine learning techniques provide more accurate classification and can self heal to adapt to changing conditions for example our search engine employs data mining and machine learning algorithms that run in the background to build topic models and we apply information extraction algorithms to identify attributes and extract entities from unstructured descriptions allowing customers to narrow their searches and quickly find the desired product we consider a large number of factors in search relevance to predict the probability of a customers interest and optimize the ranking of results the diversity of products demands that we employ modern regression techniques like trained random forests of decision trees to flexibly incorporate thousands of product attributes at rank time the end result of all this behind the scenes software fast accurate search results that help you find what you want all the effort we put into technology might not matter that much if we kept technology off to the side in some sort of rd department but we dont take that approach technology infuses all of our teams all of our processes our decision making and our approach to innovation in each of our businesses it is deeply integrated into everything we do one example is whispersync our kindle service designed to ensure that everywhere you go no matter what devices you have with you you can access your reading library and all of your highlights notes and bookmarks all in sync across your kindle devices and mobile apps the technical challenge is making this a reality for millions of kindle owners with hundreds of millions of books and hundreds of device types living in over countries around the worldat x reliability at the heart of whispersync is an eventually consistent replicated data store with application defined conflict resolution that must and can deal with device isolation lasting weeks or longer as a kindle customer of course we hide all this technology from you so when you open your kindle its in sync and on the right page to paraphrase arthur c clarke like any sufficiently advanced technology its indistinguishable from magic now if the eyes of some shareowners dutifully reading this letter are by this point glazing over i will awaken you by pointing out that in my opinion these techniques are not idly pursued they lead directly to free cash flow we live in an era of extraordinary increases in available bandwidth disk space and processing power all of which continue to get cheap fast we have on our team some of the most sophisticated technologists in the world helping to solve challenges that are right on the edge of whats possible today as ive discussed many times before we have unshakeable conviction that the long term interests of shareowners are perfectly aligned with the interests of customers and we like it that way invention is in our dna and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers we still have a lot to learn and i expect and hope well continue to have so much fun learning it i take great pride in being part of this team as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
