alberg alain moni thomas o ryder item shareholder proposal regarding a report concerning corporate political contributions investor voice queen anne ave n suite seattle wa acting on behalf bryce mathern a shareholder who as of december owned shares of common stock of the company has notified us of its intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice resolved shareholders hereby request that amazon company provide a report updated semiannually that discloses the companys policies and procedures for making with corporate funds or assets contributions and expenditures direct or indirect to a participate or intervene in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for public office or b influence the general public or any segment thereof with respect to an election or referendum monetary and non monetary contributions and expenditures direct and indirect used in the manner described in section above including a the identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each and b the title s of the person s at amazon responsible for decision making the report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board oversight committee and posted on amazons website supporting statement as long term shareholders we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities these include any activities considered intervention in any political campaign under the internal revenue codesuch as direct and indirect political contributions to candidates political parties or political organizations independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal state or local candidates disclosure is consistent with public policy in the best interest of the company and shareholders and critical for compliance with federal ethics laws moreover the supreme courts citizens united decision recognized the importance of political spending disclosure for shareholders by stating disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way this transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages gaps in transparency and accountability expose amazon to reputational and business risks that could threaten long term shareholder value amazon includes a political spending statement on its website that discloses some aggregate amounts spent on government relations efforts but we believe it is too unspecific and confusing to be meaningful studying publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the companys political spending for example amazons payments to trade associations used for political activities are undisclosed and unknown in some cases even management does not know how trade associations use our companys money accordingly amazon scored near the bottom of the cpa zicklin index of corporate accountability and disclosure which ranks the top companies in the sp scoring just out of points this proposal simply asks the company to disclose its political spending including payments to trade associations and other tax exempt organizations used for political purposes this would bring amazon in line with a growing number of leading companies including exelon merck and microsoft that both support political disclosure and accountability and present the information on their websites amazons board and its shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets therefore we urge your support for this common sense corporate governance reform end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we have posted a political expenditures statement on our website which we intend to update annually at www amazon com ir in addition we report on our political expenditures to the audit committee we have

executive officers not individually listed in the table and shares as to which one of the other executive officers may be deemed to share voting and investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis our approach to compensating employees including our named executive officers is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price named executive officers are our i chief executive officer ii chief financial officer and iii other three most highly compensated executive officers based on sec regulations our named executive officers are employed on an at will basis and named executive officer compensation generally consists of stock based compensation base salaries new hire cash bonuses and other compensation and benefits consistent with this approach we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or single trigger change in control benefits for our executive officers stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year depending on stock price performance as a result named executive officer total compensation as reported in our proxy statement may vary significantly from year to year due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership approximately he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon com since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of six years for new hire grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining amazon com the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon com the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance and expected contributions to our future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in april messrs szkutak jassy piacentini and wilke received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment mr szkutak received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr szkutaks experience and skill as chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr jassy received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr jassys experience and skill in managing web services and cloud computing operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr piacentini received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr piacentinis experience and skill in managing international consumer operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr wilke received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr wilkes experience and skill in managing north american consumer operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions in setting these amounts the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet and technology companies including aol apple best buy cisco dell ebay facebook google ibm intel intuit microsoft oracle starbucks target verizon and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data we have imposed additional vesting conditions designed to qualify stock based awards issued in previous years to named executive officers as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code however the company or the leadership development and compensation committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service base salaries consistent with our belief that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid by similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for mr piacentini due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon com mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount new hire cash bonuses new hire cash bonuses generally are paid in monthly installments to a named executive officer these bonuses are also determined by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the chief executive officer and the vice president of human resources in determining the amount of new hire cash bonuses the leadership development and compensation committee considers the same factors as described above with respect to new hire restricted stock unit grants the new hire cash bonuses are for a set amount determined at hire and are generally designed to provide appropriate total compensation until stock based awards begin to vest at which time total compensation becomes variable and largely tied to long term shareholder value none of the named executive officers received new hire cash bonuses in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees we provide security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit and we believe that the amount of the reported security expenses is especially reasonable in light of mr bezos low salary and the fact that he has never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of mr bezos security expenses reportable security expenses along with mr piacentinis expatriation benefits including a cost of living and housing allowance are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders approved on an advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our proxy statement and a frequency of every three years for casting future advisory votes approving executive compensation the leadership development and compensation committee evaluated the results of the advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as well as the other factors discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis when subsequently evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices while each of these factors informed the leadership development and compensation committees decisions regarding our executive compensation program the leadership development and compensation committee did not implement changes to our executive compensation program as a result of the shareholder advisory vote based on the factors underlying the boards recommendation regarding the frequency of future advisory votes approving executive compensation and the vote of shareholders on the matter amazon adopted a triennial shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and accordingly the next such shareholder advisory vote will occur at our annual meeting of shareholders
