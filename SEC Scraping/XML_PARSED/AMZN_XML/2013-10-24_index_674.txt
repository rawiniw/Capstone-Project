gaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information our measures of free cash flow operating expenses with and without stock based compensation and the effect of exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non gaap financial measures free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating activities is cash flow from operations reduced by purchases of property and equipment including internal use software and website development which are included in cash flow from investing activities we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows from operations since purchases of property and equipment including internal use software and website development are a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt property and equipment acquired under capital leases and other leases accounted for as financing arrangements or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows for a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with gaap see supplemental financial information and business metrics in exhibit to this current report on form k return on invested capital is a ratio based on free cash flow and as such is also a non gaap financial measure return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion if any of our long term debt over the most recent five quarter ends we believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently as with free cash flow return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures we include return on invested capital and the denominator used to calculate it called invested capital in supplemental financial information and business metrics in exhibit to this current report on form k the effect on our consolidated statements of operations from changes in exchange rates versus the u s dollar is also a non gaap financial measure information regarding the effect of exchange rates versus the u s dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period we include various measures on both an as reported basis and a basis
