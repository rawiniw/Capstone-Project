of shares of the companys common stock the board believes that it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to enable the company to implement compensation arrangements that qualify as fully tax deductible performance based compensation in the plan the board is therefore asking shareholders to approve for section m purposes the material terms of the performance goals set forth above however shareholder approval of the plan is only one of several requirements under section m that must be satisfied for amounts realized under the plan to qualify for the performance based compensation exemption under section m and submission of the material terms of the plans performance goals for shareholder approval should not be viewed as a guarantee that the company can deduct all compensation under the plan nothing in this proposal precludes the company or the leadership development and compensation committee from making any payment or granting awards that do not qualify for

service a summary of other significant terms of the plan is set forth as appendix a to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference the summary of the plan set forth in appendix a is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the plan which is filed with the securities and exchange commission as part of this proxy statement a copy of the plan also can be obtained upon request from the secretary of the company the board of directors recommends a vote for approval of the material terms of the section m performance goals as amended item shareholder proposal regarding an assessment and report concerning climate change calvert investment management inc montgomery avenue bethesda maryland acting on behalf of calvert funds that as of december owned at least shares of amazon com common stock has notified us of its intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting pax world mutual funds penhallow street suite portsmouth new hampshire acting on behalf of pax world funds that as of december owned at least shares of amazon com common stock and first affirmative financial network llc mark dabling boulevard suite colorado springs colorado acting on behalf of shareholders that as of december owned at least shares of amazon com common stock are each a co sponsor of the calvert investment management shareholder proposal the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by calvert asset management resolution to amazon com inc whereas in the intergovernmental panel on climate changes fourth assessment report stated it is very likely that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have heavily contributed to climate change furthermore there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels whereas the stern review on the economics of climate change led by the former chief economist at the world bank estimates that if we dont act the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least of global gdp each year now and forever yet investment of global gdp each year is enough for appropriate mitigation whereas in acclimatise a risk management firm reported that climate related impacts will be felt throughout a companys business model with consequences for its raw materials supply chains essential utilities assets and operations markets customers and products its workforce and the communities in which it is located whereas increasingly investors believe that there is an intersection between climate change and corporate financial performance goldman sachs reported in may we find that while many companies acknowledge the challenges climate change presents there are significant differences in the extent to which companies are taking action differences in the effectiveness of response across industries create opportunities to lose or establish competitive advantage which we believe will prove increasingly important to investment performance whereas the carbon disclosure project cdp representing institutional investors with assets of more than trillion under management requested corporations to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate related risks in february currently amazon com inc does not respond to the cdp questionnaire whereas nearly percent of sp companies and over percent of global companies have responded to the cdp including ebay inc google inc and target corp the cdp publicly cites amazon com inc as being among the u s and global companies with largest market capitalization that do not respond to the climate change survey whereas companies such as apple inc disclose information regarding the environmental footprint including greenhouse gas emissions of major electronic products amazon com currently discloses no such information regarding the kindle self described by the company as its best selling product whereas data centers which are integral to the web services business require a significant amount of energy which contributes to global climate change currently amazon com does not publicly disclose information about energy management resolved shareholders request that within months of the annual meeting the board of directors provide a report to shareholders prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information describing how amazon com inc is assessing the impact of climate change on the corporation and specifically risks related to greenhouse gas emissions energy use and logistics and the corporations plans to publicly disclose this assessment end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by calvert asset management recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we are aware of and are focused on the potential impacts of climate change we believe that e commerce is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional retailing including because online shopping on average generates less carbon emissions than typical shopping trips by car for the same items we also believe that by digitizing print and other media we offer customers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional media formats and that our cloud computing offerings can enable lower carbon business models while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations also in part due to our focus on climate change amazon has undertaken a variety of green initiatives throughout the business including environmentally friendly packaging for products and reduction of excess packaging printing on demand which eliminates excess inventory earth kaizen projects throughout the business that identify waste and design solutions that are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly implementation of energy efficient standards in our data centers including energy saving cooling systems and high efficiency lighting efforts to optimize efficiency of equipment conveyance systems and energy usage in our fulfillment centers and various green building design and other initiatives described in more detail in the amazons innovations for our planet section of our website we believe that we will continue to innovate in all of these areas over time and do not believe that preparing the ad hoc climate change report requested is an effective and prudent use of our time and resources the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding an assessment and report concerning climate change item shareholder proposal calling for certain disclosures regarding corporate political contributions investor voice queen anne ave n suite seattle wa acting on behalf of shareholders that as of january owned at least shares of common stock of the company has notified us of its intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice resolved shareholders hereby request that amazon provide a report updated semiannually disclosing amazons policies and procedures for political contributions and expenditures both direct and indirect made with corporate funds monetary and non monetary political contributions and expenditures that are not tax deductible this includes but is not limited to contributions to or expenditures on behalf of political candidates parties committees and other political entities that participate or intervene in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office as well as any portion of any dues or similar payment made to any tax exempt organization used for an expenditure or contribution that if made directly by amazon would not be deductible the report shall include an itemized accounting that includes the identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each recipient of amazons funds that are used for political contributions or expenditures as described above identification of the position of the amazon person or persons who participated in the decision to make the political contribution or expenditure the report shall be presented to the boards audit committee or other relevant oversight body and posted on amazons website supporting statement long term shareholders of amazon support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities these activities include direct and indirect contributions to candidates political parties or organizations independent expenditures or electioneering communications for federal state or local candidates disclosure is affirmed by the us supreme court is in the best interest of amazon shareholders and is critical for compliance with federal ethics legislation absent transparency and accountability amazon money can be used in ways that harm the long term interests and objectives of amazon and its shareholders despite assertions to the contrary publicly available data is not readily accessible and does not provide a complete picture of amazons political expenditures for example amazons payments to trade associations used for political activities are entirely undisclosed and unknown as evidence of this the cpa zicklin index of corporate political accountability and disclosure ranks amazon at the bottom of sp companies for political disclosurewith a score of zero out of points at many companies management does not know how trade associations use corporate money politically this proposal asks amazon to disclose all of its political contributions including payments to trade associations and other tax exempt organizations this would bring amazon in line with more than half of the sp who have disclosure polices like these and present this information to shareholders disclosure and transparency is needed for both company and shareholders to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets the bottom line is simple amazon either has this information and can readily share it with shareowners or it should have it absent which it is failing in its duty to protect shareholder value therefore please vote for this common sense governance policy end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by investor voice recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we have posted a political expenditures statement on our website which we intend to update annually at www amazon com ir in addition we report on our political expenditures to the audit committee we have not made contributions to political candidates or parties and we comply with extensive regulations requiring public disclosure of corporate political activity we participate in the political process by informing public officials about our positions on key issues significant to our customers and our business the political expenditures statement discloses our spending on federal government relations efforts which are also required to be reported to the house and senate and made publicly available at http lobbyingdisclosure house gov and http www senate gov legislative public disclosure lda reports htm the political expenditures statement also discloses our spending on state government relations efforts which are generally required to be reported and disclosed on applicable state websites of the secretary of state ethics commission public disclosure commission or legislature or similar websites as disclosed in the political expenditures statement in most of our spending on our state government relations efforts related to california specifically contributions to more jobs not taxes a coalition of an affiliate of the company and california consumers formed to seek a ballot referendum on certain provisions relating to sales tax collection in the annual california budget bill we also belong to certain trade associations and coalitions many of which engage in efforts to inform policymakers on issues important to their members the portions of our contributions these organizations spend on federal and state government relations efforts are included in the amounts we report in our political expenditures statement finally as noted in the political expenditures statement we have formed a political action committee pac but the pac is funded by voluntary contributions of our employees and shareholders and their spouses not corporate funds the pacs activities are subject to federal regulation including detailed public disclosure requirements the pac files regular public reports with the federal election commission fec and political contributions to and by the pac are required to be disclosed these reports are publicly available on the fec website at http www fec gov disclosure shtml the board recommends that you vote against this proposal calling for certain disclosures regarding corporate political

beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock held by the charitable trust includes shares issuable under a stock based award that vested april includes shares beneficially owned by other executive officers not individually listed in the table of which shares are issuable under stock based awards that are scheduled to vest within days after february executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis our approach to compensating employees including our named executive officers is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in our stock price named executive officers are our i chief executive officer ii chief financial officer and iii other three most highly compensated executive officers based on sec regulations our named executive officers are employed on an at will basis and named executive officer compensation generally consists of stock based compensation base salaries new hire cash bonuses and other compensation and benefits consistent with this approach we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or single trigger change in control benefits for our executive officers stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership approximately he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon com since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of four to six years for new hire grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining amazon com the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon com the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance and expected contributions to our future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus the projected value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in the named executive officers did not receive any new equity awards in evaluating the compensation of our named executive officers in the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet and technology companies including aol best buy cisco dell ebay gap google ibm intel intuit microsoft oracle target and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data we have imposed additional vesting conditions designed to qualify stock based awards issued in previous years to named executive officers as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code base salaries consistent with our belief that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid by similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for mr piacentini with mr wilkes salary increasing from to for the year due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon com mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount new hire cash bonuses new hire cash bonuses generally are paid in monthly installments to a named executive officer these bonuses are also determined by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the chief executive officer and the vice president of human resources in determining the amount of new hire cash bonuses the leadership development and compensation committee considers the same factors as described above with respect to new hire restricted stock unit grants the new hire cash bonuses are for a set amount determined at hire and are generally designed to provide appropriate total compensation until stock based compensation begins to vest at which time total compensation becomes variable and largely tied to long term shareholder value none of the named executive officers received new hire cash bonuses in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees we provide security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit and we believe that the amount of the reported security expenses is especially reasonable in light of mr bezos low salary and the fact that he has never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of mr bezos security expenses reportable security expenses along with mr piacentinis expatriation benefits including a cost of living and housing allowance are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders approved on an advisory basis the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our proxy statement and a frequency of every three years for casting future advisory votes approving executive compensation the leadership development and compensation committee evaluated the results of the advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as well as the other factors discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis when subsequently evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices while each of these factors informed the leadership development and compensation committees decisions regarding our executive compensation program the leadership development and compensation committee did not implement changes to our executive compensation program as a result of the shareholder advisory vote based on the factors underlying the boards recommendation regarding the frequency of future advisory votes approving executive compensation and the vote of shareholders on the matter amazon adopted a triennial shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation and accordingly the next such shareholder advisory vote will occur at our annual meeting of shareholders leadership development and compensation committee report the leadership development and compensation committee which is composed solely of independent members of the board of directors assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to among other things establishing and reviewing compensation of the companys executive officers the leadership development and compensation committee reviewed and discussed with management the companys compensation discussion and analysis and based on the review and discussion recommended to the board that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this proxy statement the leadership development and compensationcommittee william b gordon jamie s
