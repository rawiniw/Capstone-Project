the process you undertook to reach that conclusion response for the proxy statement the company determined that disclosure in response to item s of regulation s k was not required members of the companys legal and hr departments first reviewed and considered the companys compensation programs and determined that for most employees including senior management with the exception of the founder and ceo as noted below compensation consists of base salaries restricted stock unit rsu grants and for certain new hires fixed cash bonuses that are paid based on continued employment the legal and hr teams concluded that these programs were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company in part because employees are rewarded through their rsu grants which help to incent the building of long term shareholder value in addition the legal and hr teams reviewed and considered the fact that the founder and ceo receives a salary which is low compared to his peers and security benefits but has never accepted bonuses or equity based compensation the legal and hr teams also reviewed and considered programs that differ or are in addition to the programs described above which are primarily cash incentive programs to certain employee groups based on the achievement of certain metrics such as order fulfillment customer service or sales the legal and hr teams concluded that these programs were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company based on factors regarding the nature and design of these programs including in the case of the cash incentive programs the fact that the companys officers did not participate the legal and hr teams conclusions were then reviewed with outside counsel certain reviewers of the draft proxy statement the
