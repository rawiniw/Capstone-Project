shareholders letter to shareholders exhibit to our shareowners the power of invention to us the value of amazon web services is undeniable in twenty seconds we can double our server capacity in a high growth environment like ours and with a small team of developers its very important for us to trust that we have the best support to give to the music community around the world five years ago we would have crashed and been down without knowing when we would be back now because of amazons continued innovation we can provide the best technology and continue to grow thats christopher tholen the chief technology officer of bandpage his comments about how aws helps with the critical need to scale compute capacity quickly and reliably are not hypothetical bandpage now helps bands and artists connect with tens of millions of fans so i started selling on amazon in april of and by the time we became the top amazon lunchbox seller in june we had between and orders a day when we hit august and september our busiest time with the start of the school year we had sometimes orders a day it was just phenomenal im using amazon to fulfill my orders which makes my life easier plus when my customers found out they could get free shipping with prime subscriptions the lunchboxes began selling like crazy kelly lester is the mom entrepreneur of easylunchboxes her own innovative line of easy to pack environmentally friendly lunchbox containers i sort of stumbled onto it and it opened a whole new world for me since i had over a thousand book titles at my house i thought ill give this a try i sold some and i kept expanding it and expanding it and come to find out this was so much fun i decided i dont ever want to get another job again and ive got no boss other than my wife that is what could be better than that we actually work together on this we both go out hunting so its a team effort thats worked out very well we sell about books a month we ship between and to amazon each month and amazon ships out the that people buy without amazon handling shipping and customer service my wife and i would have to be running to the post office or someplace every day with dozens of packages with that part taken care of for us life is much simpler this is a terrific program and i love it after all amazon supplies the customers and even ships the books i mean how can it get better than that bob frank founded rjf books and more after getting laid off in the midst of the economic downturn he and his wife split their time between phoenix and minneapolis and he describes finding the books he sells like a treasure hunt every day because of kindle direct publishing i earn more royalties in one month than i ever did in a year of writing for a traditional house i have gone from worrying about if i will be able to pay the bills and there were many months when i couldnt to finally having real savings even thinking about a vacation something i havent done in years amazon has allowed me to really spread my wings prior i was boxed into a genre yet i had all of these other books i wanted to write now i can do just that i manage my career i feel as if i finally have a partner in amazon they understand this business and have changed the face of publishing for the good of the writer and the reader putting choices back into our hands thats a k alexander author of daddys home one of the top best selling kindle books in march i had no idea that march of the first month i decided to publish on kdp would be a defining moment in my life within a year of doing so i was making enough on a monthly basis to quit my day job and focus on writing full time the rewards that have sprung out of deciding to publish through kdp have been nothing short of life changing financially personally emotionally creatively the ability to write full time to be home with my family and to write exactly what i want without the input of a legacy publisher marketing committee wanting to have a say in every detail of my writing has made me a stronger writer a more prolific writer and most importantly a far happier one amazon and kdp are literally enabling creativity in the publishing world and giving writers like me a shot at their dream and for that i am forever grateful thats blake crouch author of several thrillers including the kindle best seller run amazon has made it possible for authors like me to get their work in front of readers and has changed my life in a little over a year i have sold nearly books through the kindle and have traded in old dreams for bigger and better ones four of my books have hit the top kindle best sellers list also i have been approached by agents foreign sales people and two movie producers and have received mentions in the latimes wall street journal and pc magazine and was recently interviewed by usa today mostly i am excited that all writers now have the opportunity to get their work in front of readers without jumping through insurmountable hoops writers have more options and readers have more choices the publishing world is changing fast and i plan to enjoy every minute of the ride theresa ragan is the kdp author of multiple kindle best sellers including abducted past age and in the midst of the recession my wife and i found our income options severely limited kdp was my one shot at a lifelong dream our only chance at financial salvation within months of publishing kdp has completely changed our lives enabling this aging nonfiction writer to launch a brand new career as a best selling novelist i cant say enough on behalf of amazon and the many tools that they make available to independent authors without reservation i urge fellow writers to investigate and seize the opportunities that kdp offers as ive happily discovered there is zero downside risk and the potential is virtually unlimited robert bidinotto is the author of the kindle best seller hunter a thriller i leveraged kdps technology to blow through all the traditional gatekeepers can you imagine how that feels after struggling so hard for so long for every single reader now inspirational fiction lovers i never would have reached are enjoying nobody and my other two novels from the kindle store at ive always wanted to write a cinderella story now i have and thanks to prince charming kdp there will be more to come creston mapes is the author of the kindle best seller nobody invention comes in many forms and at many scales the most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others to unleash their creativity to pursue their dreams thats a big part of whats going on with amazon web services fulfillment by amazon and kindle direct publishing with aws fba and kdp we are creating powerful self service platforms that allow thousands of people to boldly experiment and accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or impractical these innovative large scale platforms are not zero sum they create win win situations and create significant value for developers entrepreneurs customers authors and readers amazon web services has grown to have thirty different services and thousands of large and small businesses and individual developers as customers one of the first aws offerings the simple storage service or s now holds over billion data objects with more than a billion new objects being added every day s routinely handles more than transactions per second and has peaked at close to a million transactions per second all aws services are pay as you go and radically transform capital expense into a variable cost aws is self service you dont need to negotiate a contract or engage with a salesperson you can just read the online documentation and get started aws services are elastic they easily scale up and easily scale down in just the last quarter of fulfillment by amazon shipped tens of millions of items on behalf of sellers when sellers use fba their items become eligible for amazon prime for super saver shipping and for amazon returns processing and customer service fba is self service and comes with an easy to use inventory management console as part of amazon seller central for the more technically inclined it also comes with a set of apis so that you can use our global fulfillment center network like a giant computer peripheral i am emphasizing the self service nature of these platforms because its important for a reason i think is somewhat non obvious even well meaning gatekeepers slow innovation when a platform is self service even the improbable ideas can get tried because theres no expert gatekeeper ready to say that will never work and guess what many of those improbable ideas do work and society is the beneficiary of that diversity kindle direct publishing has quickly taken on astonishing scale more than a thousand kdp authors now each sell more than a thousand copies a month some have already reached hundreds of thousands of sales and two have already joined the kindle million club kdp is a big win for authors authors who use kdp get to keep their copyrights keep their derivative rights get to publish on their schedule a typical delay in traditional publishing can be a year or more from the time the book is finished and saving the best for last kdp authors can get paid royalties of the largest traditional publishers pay royalties of only on ebooks they pay of of the selling price which works out to be of the selling price the kdp royalty structure is completely transformative for authors a typical selling price for a kdp book is a reader friendly authors get approximately of that with the legacy royalty of the selling price would have to be to yield the same per unit royalty i assure you that authors sell many many more copies at than they would at kindle direct publishing is good for readers because they get lower prices but perhaps just as important readers also get access to more diversity since authors that might have been rejected by establishment publishing channels now get their chance in the marketplace you can get a pretty good window into this take a look at the kindle best seller list and compare it to the new york times best seller list which is more diverse the kindle list is chock full of books from small presses and self published authors while the new york times list is dominated by successful and established authors amazonians are leaning into the future with radical and transformational innovations that create value for thousands of authors entrepreneurs and developers invention has become second nature at amazon and in my view the teams pace of innovation is even accelerating i can assure you its very energizing im extremely proud of the whole team and feel lucky to have a front row seat as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement
