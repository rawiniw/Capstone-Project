listed in order of significance contributing to the changes between and compared to the comparable prior year periods these initiatives encompass a large number of investment and capital spending projects that because of the cross functionality of our systems and operations and the continuing expansion of our operations into new regions often support a variety of product and service offerings

continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital and operating lease financing arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructureand technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing orissue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all results of operations page net sales page in your analysis of net sales on page you often attribute your ability to increase unit sales to several different factors that led to reduced prices for your customers for example you disclose that your north american sales growth of and in and was driven by increased unit sales in each year and you attribute your ability to increase unit sales on several programs to reduce prices for your customers including from your shipping offers by sales in faster growing categories such as electronics and other general merchandise by increased stock inventory availability and by increased selection of product offerings when you list multiple factors that contribute to changes in your net sales in future filings please quantify if possible the impact of each material factor that you discuss to provide investors with better insight into the underlying reasons behind the changes in your results please show us your proposed revised disclosure for additional information please refer to item a of regulation s k responseon page of managements discussion and analysis we disclose that net sales grew primarily as a result of a single factor increased unit sales including sales by marketplace sellers while our experience over time has demonstrated that focusing on reducing prices for our customers including from shipping offers increasing sales in faster growing categories increased in stock inventory availability and increasing selection of product offerings drives increased sales predominantly through increased unit sales we are unable to isolate and quantify the discrete impact of these factors on unit sales both because the factors may affect individual customers purchasing decisions in different ways and due to the volume of products sold across our websites however we will continue to disclose the impact of material nonrecurring drivers which in managements view affect trends or are necessary to understand the results of our operations for example in our form q for the quarterly period ended march we quantified the estimated impact of the japan earthquake and related events august page please include a detailed qualitative and quantitative discussion of the revenue that is associated with specific products and services within the general categories identified on page media electronics and other merchandise and other and the impact of such products on your net sales including your kindle products and services your amazon prime content and related services and the different products and services offered by aws please refer to item a of regulation s k please include similar disclosure regarding the costs associated with such products and services under results of operations operating expenses please show us your proposed revised disclosure responsewe believe our disclosures satisfy item a the commissions guidance regarding managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations release nos indicates that as the complexity of business structures and financial transactions increase and as the activities undertaken by companies become more diverse it is increasingly important for companies to focus their management discussion and analysis on material information we focus on providing a wide selection of products and services to our customers across many categories for example we offer over million unique products in the united states alone because of managements focus on even further increasing this diversity we have aggregated these into groups of similar products and services and disclosed their net sales in the notes to our financial statements and in a table in managements discussion and analysis see k notes to consolidated financial statements note segment information pages and managements discussion and analysis results of operations supplementary information page this wide and growing selection of products and services share a combined and integrated fulfillment marketing technology and content infrastructure to provide an analysis of these costs we have aggregated these expenses into similar types of expenses including fulfillment marketing technology and content and general and administrative we provide an analysis of these costs and of costs of sales within our operating expenses and cost of sales in our managements discussion and analysis see k managements discussion and analysis results of operations operating expenses and cost of sales sections pages in addition kindle e readers fire tablets fire tv fire phone and amazon prime span a wide variety of products and services our family of kindle devices along with our fire tv and fire phone and the suite of amazon apps that operate on other manufacturers devices serve as platforms to experience the free selection of video book and music content provided through our amazon prime service as well as for paid entertainment content and serve as a portal for purchasing any of the other physical and digital products offered on our many websites throughout the world our amazon prime customers also receive expedited shipping on many products they order additionally kindle products and services including kindle e readers fire tablets fire tv and fire phone prime membership and related services as well as services offered by aws were individually less than of net sales in all periods presented we therefore believe that we have appropriately grouped similar products and services within our media electronics and other general merchandise and other categories which currently consist of more than product and service categories in the event sales within any of our individual products or services categories begin to approach a significant level of net sales we would consider this an indication to evaluate the benefit of additional disclosure regarding the revenue associated with such category august page conclusion we hereby acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in its filing staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing and the
