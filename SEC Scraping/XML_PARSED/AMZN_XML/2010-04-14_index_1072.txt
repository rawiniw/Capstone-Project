executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis amazon coms approach to compensating its employees including its named executive officers is to tie total compensation to long term shareholder value as reflected primarily in the companys stock price named executive officers are the companys i chief executive officer ii chief financial officer and iii other three most highly compensated executive officers based on sec regulations the companys employment offer letters with its named executive officers provide for at will employment and named executive officer compensation generally consists of stock based compensation base salaries new hire cash bonuses and other compensation and benefits stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis due to mr bezos substantial ownership in the company approximately mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from the company since late the company has used restricted stock units as its primary stock based compensation vehicle the company believes that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of four to six years for new hire grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider various factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at the company the named executive officers expected level of responsibility at the company and expected contributions to the companys future success and the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider various factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to company performance and expected contributions to the companys future success as well as the market compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with the companys annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus the projected value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because the company focuses on total compensation over time and takes into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation based on the vesting schedule of her previous awards as well as factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants in april ms reynolds received a restricted stock unit award with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment the company has imposed additional vesting conditions designed to qualify this award along with certain other awards issued in previous years to named executive officers as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code no other executive officers received a restricted stock unit award in base salaries consistent with the companys belief that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid by similarly situated companies base salaries for named executive officers remained flat during compared to and ranged from for mr bezos to for mr piacentini base salaries were for the other named executive officers due to mr bezos substantial ownership in the company mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount new hire cash bonuses new hire cash bonuses generally are paid in monthly installments to a named executive officer these bonuses are also determined by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the chief executive officer and the vice president of human resources in determining the amount of new hire cash bonuses the leadership development and compensation committee considers the same factors as described above with respect to new hire restricted stock unit grants the new hire cash bonuses are for a set amount determined at hire and are generally designed to provide appropriate total compensation until stock based compensation begins to vest at which time total compensation becomes variable and largely tied to long term shareholder value in mr gunningham received new hire cash bonus payments as shown in the bonus column of the summary compensation table other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of the companys employees the company provides security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel the company believes that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit the company provides relocation assistance to newly hired executives consistent with what it provides to other employees and it provided this assistance to mr gunningham in the amounts attributable to security benefits for mr bezos relocation assistance for mr gunningham and expatriation benefits including a cost of living and housing allowance for mr piacentini are included in the

compensation committee report the leadership development and compensation committee which is composed solely of independent members of the board of directors assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to among other things establishing and reviewing compensation of the companys executive officers the leadership development and compensation committee reviewed and
