connection with a proxy proposal to be voted on at the registrants annual meeting important proxy voting material shareholder rebuttal to the amazon com inc opposition statement regarding climate change p of amazon coms proxy item shareholder proposal this proposal has been filed by calvert investment management inc c i m on behalf of calvert social index fund calvert equity portfolio calvert vp sri equity portfolio calvert vp sp index portfolio and calvert vp nasdaq index portfolio as an investor in amazon com inc amazon through these funds c i m is concerned with the companys lack of disclosure around its assessment and management of climate change c i m believes that information from corporations on their climate change risks and management strategies is essential to investors as they assess the strengths of corporate securities in the context of climate change all companies regardless of industry face potential challenges and opportunities from climate change amazons primary arguments against this proposal as stated in its opposition statement are that they are aware of and are focused on the potential impacts of climate change but they do not believe that preparing an ad hoc climate change report is an efficient use of time and resources furthermore the company has already undertaken green initiatives as demonstrated in its amazon and our planet web page e commerce is inherently more environmentally friendly than traditional retailing and that the company will continue to innovate in this area over time our rebuttal and rationale for a yes vote follows this proposal calls on the company to disclose information on how it is assessing and managing climate change we acknowledge and applaud the companys current initiatives to green some of its operations but as investors we are asking for specific data and qualitative information relating to its impact on climate change from activities that cause greenhouse gas ghg emissions and how it is dealing with risks and opportunities from climate change related to the company seventy percent of sp companies and over percent of global companies disclose this type of information through the carbon disclosure project including companies such as ebay inc apple inc and target corp many of these companies also choose to disclose key climate related information through public websites and sustainability or corporate social responsibility reports amazons business has an impact on the environment and on climate change in particular that is not currently addressed by the company through public disclosures the companys claim regarding the environmentally friendliness of e commerce fails to recognize key climate related impacts related to amazons operations as a major company in the e commerce industry and with a growing web services business amazon relies on data centers to process and store massive amounts of electronic information data centers require significant amounts of energy to power cooling system infrastructure due to their electricity use it is estimated that data centers are responsible for two percent of global ghg emissions which is greater than the climate impact of the aviation sector according to recent reports from the company amazon plans to expand its cloud computing business which inevitably creates a greater demand for data center operations the company does not disclose any information on its data centers energy consumption emissions or related reduction plans the amazon kindle e reader which the company self reports to be its top selling product is a consumer electronic product that is ostensibly made from an arrangement of plastics metals and chemicals with regard to the kindle amazon assumes the role of electronics developer and retailer similar to apple inc apple products such as the ipod and ipad are manufactured by electronics manufacturer foxconn a company that is believed to be the manufacturer of the amazon kindle unlike apple however amazon does not disclose any information regarding the environmental footprint of its popular e reader including associated emissions from its production or use amazon may face a number of business risks due to climate change none of which are addressed in public disclosures including those related to regulation energy and fuel costs reputation and physical impacts which specifically could
