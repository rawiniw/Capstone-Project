senior vice president dated april ex d dex htm ex ex exhibit to our shareowners the american customer satisfaction index recently announced the results of its annual survey and for the th year in a row customers ranked amazon the united kingdom has a similar index the u k customer satisfaction index put out by the institute of customer service for the th time in a row amazon u k ranked in that survey amazon was also just named the business on linkedins top companies list which ranks the most sought after places to work for professionals in the united states and just a few weeks ago harris poll released its annual reputation quotient which surveys over consumers on a broad range of topics from workplace environment to social responsibility to products and services and for the rd year in a row amazon ranked congratulations and thank you to the now over amazonians who come to work every day with unrelenting customer obsession ingenuity and commitment to operational excellence and on behalf of amazonians everywhere i want to extend a huge thank you to customers its incredibly energizing for us to see your responses to these surveys one thing i love about customers is that they are divinely discontent their expectations are never static they go up its human nature we didnt ascend from our hunter gatherer days by being satisfied people have a voracious appetite for a better way and yesterdays wow quickly becomes todays ordinary i see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before it may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones customers can read reviews compare prices from multiple retailers see whether somethings in stock find out how fast it will ship or be available for pick up and more these examples are from retail but i sense that the same customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at amazon and most other industries as well you cannot rest on your laurels in this world customers wont have it how do you stay ahead of ever rising customer expectations theres no single way to do it its a combination of many things but high standards widely deployed and at all levels of detail are certainly a big part of it weve had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high expectations of customers weve also had billions of dollars worth of failures along the way with those experiences as backdrop id like to share with you the essentials of what weve learned so far about high standards inside an organization intrinsic or teachable first theres a foundational question are high standards intrinsic or teachable if you take me on your basketball team you can teach me many things but you cant teach me to be taller do we first and foremost need to select for high standards people if so this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices but i dont think so i believe high standards are teachable in fact people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure high standards are contagious bring a new person onto a high standards team and theyll quickly adapt the opposite is also true if low standards prevail those too will quickly spread and though exposure works well to teach high standards i believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards which i hope to share in this letter universal or domain specific another important question is whether high standards are universal or domain specific in other words if you have high standards in one area do you automatically have high standards elsewhere i believe high standards are domain specific and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest when i started amazon i had high standards on inventing on customer care and thankfully on hiring but i didnt have high standards on operational process how to keep fixed problems fixed how to eliminate defects at the root how to inspect processes and much more i had to learn and develop high standards on all of that my colleagues were my tutors understanding this point is important because it keeps you humble you can consider yourself a person of high standards in general and still have debilitating blind spots there can be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even know that your standards are low or non existent and certainly not world class its critical to be open to that likelihood recognition and scope what do you need to achieve high standards in a particular domain area first you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain second you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be how much work it will take to achieve that result the scope let me give you two examples one is a sort of toy illustration but it makes the point clearly and another is a real one that comes up at amazon all the time perfect handstands a close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free standing handstand no leaning against a wall not for just a few seconds instagram good she decided to start her journey by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio she then practiced for a while but wasnt getting the results she wanted so she hired a handstand coach yes i know what youre thinking but evidently this is an actual thing that exists in the very first lesson the coach gave her some wonderful advice most people he said think that if they work hard they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks the reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice if you think you should be able to do it in two weeks youre just going to end up quitting unrealistic beliefs on scope often hidden and undiscussed kill high standards to achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be something this coach understood well six page narratives we dont do powerpoint or any other slide oriented presentations at amazon instead we write narratively structured six page memos we silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of study hall not surprisingly the quality of these memos varies widely some have the clarity of angels singing they are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high quality discussion sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum in the handstand example its pretty straightforward to recognize high standards it wouldnt be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well executed handstand and then youre either doing it or youre not the writing example is very different the difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier it would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo nevertheless i find that much of the time readers react to great memos very similarly they know it when they see it the standard is there and it is real even if its not easily describable heres what weve figured out often when a memo isnt great its not the writers inability to recognize the high standard but instead a wrong expectation on scope they mistakenly believe a high standards six page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours when really it might take a week or more theyre trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks and were not coaching them right the great memos are written and re written shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work set aside for a couple of days and then edited again with a fresh mind they simply cant be done in a day or two the key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope that a great memo probably should take a week or more skill beyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope how about skill surely to write a world class memo you have to be an extremely skilled writer is it another required element in my view not so much at least not for the individual in the context of teams the football coach doesnt need to be able to throw and a film director doesnt need to be able to act but they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope even in the example of writing a six page memo thats teamwork someone on the team needs to have the skill but it doesnt have to be you as a side note by tradition at amazon authors names never appear on the memos the memo is from the whole team benefits of high standards building a culture of high standards is well worth the effort and there are many benefits naturally and most obviously youre going to build better products and services for customers this would be reason enough perhaps a little less obvious people are drawn to high standards they help with recruiting and retention more subtle a culture of high standards is protective of all the invisible but crucial work that goes on in every company im talking about the work that no one sees the work that gets done when no one is watching in a high standards culture doing that work well is its own reward its part of what it means to be a professional and finally high standards are fun once youve tasted high standards theres no going back so the four elements of high standards as we see it they are teachable they are domain specific you must recognize them and you must explicitly coach realistic scope for us these work at all levels of detail everything from writing memos to whole new clean sheet business initiatives we hope they help you too insist on the highest standards leaders have relentlessly high standards many people may think these standards are unreasonably high from the amazon leadership principles recent milestones the high standards our leaders strive for have served us well and while i certainly cant do a handstand myself im extremely proud to share some of the milestones we hit last year each of which represents the fruition of many years of collective effort we take none of them for granted prime years post launch we have exceeded million paid prime members globally in amazon shipped more than five billion items with prime worldwide and more new members joined prime

there is much we can do better and we find tremendous energy in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead a huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you to our shareowners for your support and to amazonians everywhere for your ingenuity your passion and your high standards as always i attach a copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement
