responds to your letter of november regarding our annual report on form k for the year ended december the k each of your comments is set forth below followed by our response we appreciate the opportunity to discuss those comments with the staff on december and have also reflected those discussions in our responses below form k for the fiscal year ended december managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsresults of operationsnet sales page we note your response to comment and your statement that growth in overall unit sales has been the primary driver of net sales across the many and expanding product categories and services sold through y our website and you have not identified individual drivers within media or egm given the many product categories and services sold through your website and the continued increase in net sales which you attribute primarily to increased unit sales please disclose whether you have identified individual drivers or trends in any product category with a view to enhancing an understanding of where you are experiencing increases in sales if increased unit sales are not attributable to any particular product category and are instead reflective of largely uniform increases in unit sales across all of your product categories please state as much responsewe focus on providing a wide selection of products and services to our customers offering hundreds of millions of unique products that are sold by us or by third parties across dozens of diverse product categories such as books consumer electronics apparel automotive and pet supplies if we identify individual drivers or trends that would be material to an understanding of net product sales we have in the december page past and will in the future disclose those matters in our mda in addition if revenue contributed by any class of similar products or services accounted for or more of net sales we would disclose the information required under item c of regulation s k unlike some retailers we do not describe our business to investors in terms of particular product offerings given the breadth of our product offerings and our ongoing efforts to increase unit sales across our businesses including through increased product lines and product selection and the fact that no product category accounts for more than of net sales we do not believe that more detailed information on sales by product categories is required or would provide meaningful information to investors in this regard our view is consistent with the commissions guidance regarding managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as set forth in release no which states that as the complexity of business structures and financial transactions increase and as the activities undertaken by companies become more diverse it is increasingly important for companies to focus their mda on material information we recognize that some brick and mortar retailers report sales by broad aggregation of product categories however brick and mortar retailers also report other financial and performance data that is not relevant to our business model such as number of stores or square feet of retail space or same store sales unlike a brick and mortar retailer our decision to stock and market a particular product or category of products does not preclude us from giving equal shelf space to other products and categories of products if consumer demand shifts we are able to adjust our offerings rapidly to maximize our unit sales without making the management decision to devote less selling space to other products we also do not believe that any brick and mortar retailer matches the sheer volume and diversity of products and product categories that we offer finally information on our product sales would not present a complete or accurate picture of what products are drawing customers to our websites or generating cash for our operations as it would not reflect sales through our websites of identical or similar products by third party sellers the revenue of which is reflected as service sales and not product sales accordingly we are mindful of the statement in release no that companies should focus on the challenge of identifying information that is required to be disclosed or that promotes understanding while avoiding unnecessary information overload for readers by not disclosing a greater body of information just because it is available where disclosure is not required and does not promote understanding consistent with our past discussions with the staff around our disclosures we confirm that in preparing annual and quarterly disclosures in our mda we assess whether there are any individual drivers or trends in any product category that would be material to an understanding of our net sales growth in this regard we note that unit sales growth rates may vary across different products and yet those differences may not be material to our net sales growth as a result of factors such as the number of units sold in the past and the relative sales price per unit to date no individual product category has represented more than of net sales however we will continue to evaluate whether additional disclosure is appropriate if a product category begins to approach a significant level of net sales or reflect a trend that is material to an understanding of our net sales growth notes to consolidated financial statementsnote description of business and accounting policiestechnology and content page we reviewed your response to comment as previously requested please disclose the total amount of research and development costs charged to expense for each year presented in the consolidated statements of operations as required by asc in making your determination of what constitutes research and development please consider the activities typically considered research and development as set forth in asc in addition please describe to us in detail the nature of the expenditures that you december page determined meet the definition of research and development costs and walk us through your reasoning process in your determination of research and development costs to the extent such activities are not encompassed by the examples provided in asc please provide a similar narrative to us regarding your determination of research and development activities charged to the aws segment responsewe continuously seek to invent on behalf of our customers and to improve their experience through improvements to our websites enhancements to existing products and services and development of new product and service offerings including through amazon web services we believe that focusing on our customers is essential to our ability to sustain long term growth in free cash flow our leadership principles are instilled in all employees with the expectation that the principles are used as part of a decision making process and all employees are expected to invent and simplify for our customers because of our relentless focus on innovation and customer obsession we do not manage our business by separating activities of the type that under asc are typically considered research and development from our other activities that are directed at ongoing innovation and enhancements to our innovations instead we manage the total investment in our employees and infrastructure across all our product and service offerings rather than viewing it as related to a particular product or service we view and manage these costs collectively as investments being made on behalf of our customers in order to improve the customer experience we believe this approach to managing our business is different from the concept of planned and focused projects with specific objectives that was contemplated when the accounting standards for research and development were developed under fas given the significant breadth of projects and improvements that we have underway our employees routinely work concurrently on multiple projects including projects that could be defined as research and development in nature and also more routine ongoing activities to refine enrich or otherwise improve or adapt our existing products and services similarly our activities may focus on developing new products and services but these activities often result in whole or in part in enhancements to existing products and services because of our relentless focus on innovation we do not believe that separate disclosure of the costs associated with activities of the type set forth in asc would be material to understanding our business we are concerned that separate disclosure of such costs would focus our financial statement users on a metric that understates the level of innovation in which we are investing as stated in fas the intent of fasbs guidance on this topic was to provide useful financial information about research and development costs we believe that providing a metric that is narrowly defined by the activities set forth in asc and not used by management because it is considered to be incomplete would fail to meet the objective of being useful information in the context of our operations we present technology costs and content costs as a single line item in our consolidated financial statements as such costs represent investments to develop new products enhance existing products and improve our website that are often the types of costs described in asc similarly our infrastructure costs support our ongoing investment activities collectively these costs span the scope of the research and development guidance and the internal use software guidance both of which require these categories of costs to be expensed as incurred we believe that our classification is appropriate in this context given the overlapping nature of our costs similarly we believe disclosure of our technology and content costs satisfies the objective of providing useful financial information about research and development costs because our technology and content costs collectively best reflect the investments we are making to innovate on behalf of customers and to sustain long term growth in free cash flows we believe the revised disclosures proposed in our october response to the staff letter of september further clarify the nature of these costs and their relation to our research and development activities december page if you have any
