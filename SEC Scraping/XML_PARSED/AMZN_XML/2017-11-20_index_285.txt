in a principal amount that has been rounded down to or the nearest lesser whole multiple of that is larger than as applicable and pay a cash amount equal to the difference between i the principal

the proposed amendments thereafter all such whole foods market notes will be governed by the amended whole foods market indenture which will be less restrictive and afford reduced protections to any remaining holders of whole foods market notes compared to those currently in place additionally the trading market for any remaining whole foods market notes may be more limited than it is at present and the smaller outstanding principal amount may make the trading market of any remaining whole foods market notes more volatile consequently the liquidity market value and price of whole foods market

which will be less restrictive and afford reduced protections to any remaining holders of the whole foods market notes compared to those currently in place additionally the trading market for any remaining whole foods market notes may be more limited than it is at present and the smaller outstanding principal amount may make the trading market of any remaining whole foods market notes more volatile consequently the liquidity market value and price of whole foods market notes that remain outstanding may be materially and adversely affected therefore if your whole foods market notes are not tendered and accepted in the exchange offer it may become more difficult for you to sell or transfer your unexchanged whole foods market notes whole foods market has already ceased reporting under

law the amazon indenture provides that new york law shall govern any action regarding the notes brought pursuant to the indenture table of contents risk factors participating in the exchange offer and the consent solicitation involves certain risks in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks before deciding whether participating in the exchange offer and consent solicitation is suitable for you in addition you should carefully consider the other risks uncertainties and assumptions that are set forth under the caption risk factors in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september before deciding to participate in the exchange offer and consent solicitation in addition to the foregoing risks relating to us the following are additional risks relating to the amazon notes the exchange offer and the consent solicitation risks related to the amazon notes the amazon notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries the amazon notes are obligations exclusively of amazon com inc and not of any of our subsidiaries our operations are primarily conducted through our subsidiaries which are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the amazon notes or to make any funds available therefor whether by dividends loans or other payments except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries all claims of creditors including trade creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and therefore the claims of our creditors including holders of the amazon notes consequently the amazon notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish the amazon notes are subject to prior claims of any secured creditors and if a default occurs we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the amazon notes the amazon notes are unsecured general obligations ranking equally with other senior unsecured indebtedness of amazon outstanding from time to time the amazon indenture and our existing outstanding senior notes the existing amazon notes and the agreements governing our other debt permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness including secured debt if we incur any additional secured debt our assets will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the amazon notes only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full holders of the amazon notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated creditors including holders of our existing amazon notes and our trade creditors if we incur any additional obligations that rank equally with the amazon notes including trade payables the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the amazon notes and the existing amazon notes in any proceeds distributed upon our insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up this may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you if there are not sufficient assets remaining to pay all of these creditors all or a portion of the amazon notes then outstanding would remain unpaid the limited covenants in the amazon indenture and the terms of the amazon notes do not provide protection against some types of important corporate events and may not protect your investment the amazon indenture does not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth revenues income cash flow or liquidity and accordingly does not protect holders of the amazon notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations table of contents restrict our subsidiaries ability to issue securities or otherwise incur indebtedness or other liabilities that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would be structurally senior to the amazon notes limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness that would effectively rank senior to the amazon notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness or to engage in sale leaseback transactions limit our ability to incur indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to the amazon notes restrict our ability to repurchase or prepay our securities restrict our ability to make investments or to repurchase or pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the amazon notes restrict our ability to enter into highly leveraged transactions or require us to repurchase the amazon notes in the event of a change in control as a result of the foregoing when evaluating the terms of the amazon notes you should be aware that the terms of the amazon indenture and the amazon notes do not restrict our ability to engage in or to otherwise be a party to a variety of corporate transactions circumstances and events such as certain acquisitions refinancings or recapitalizations that could substantially and adversely affect our capital structure and the value of the amazon notes for these reasons you should not consider the covenants in the amazon indenture as a significant factor in evaluating whether to invest in the amazon notes changes in our credit ratings may adversely affect your investment in the amazon notes the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt these ratings are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell the amazon notes inasmuch as the ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the amazon notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued the ratings are based on information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market value and liquidity of the amazon notes and increase our corporate borrowing costs there may not be active trading markets for the amazon notes we cannot assure you that trading markets for the amazon notes will ever develop or will be maintained further there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for the amazon notes your ability to sell your amazon notes or the prices at which you will be able to sell your amazon notes future trading prices of the amazon notes will depend on many factors including prevailing interest rates our financial condition and results of operations the then current ratings assigned to the amazon notes and the market for similar securities any trading markets that develop for the amazon notes would be affected by many factors independent of and in addition to the foregoing including the propensity of existing holders to trade their positions in such amazon notes time remaining to the maturity of such amazon notes outstanding amount of such amazon notes redemption of such amazon notes and level direction and volatility of market interest rates generally table of contents redemption of the amazon notes may adversely affect your return on such amazon notes we have the right to redeem all of the amazon notes prior to maturity we may redeem these amazon notes at times when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low accordingly you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of your amazon notes risks related to the exchange offer and the consent solicitation the proposed amendments to the whole foods market indenture will reduce protections for remaining holders of whole foods market notes although the whole foods market indenture currently contains limited protections if the proposed amendments to the whole foods market indenture are adopted the covenants and certain other terms of such amended whole foods market notes will be even less restrictive and will afford reduced protections to any remaining holders of such whole foods market notes compared to the covenants and other provisions currently in place the proposed amendments to the whole foods market indenture would among other things eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants the change of control provisions certain requirements that must be met for whole foods market to consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets and certain events of default in the whole foods market indenture so they will no longer apply as well as change the delivery date of the annual compliance certificate if the proposed amendments are adopted for the whole foods market notes each non exchanging holder of the whole foods market notes will be bound by the proposed amendments even if that holder did not consent to the proposed amendments these amendments will permit us to take certain actions previously prohibited that could increase the credit risk of whole foods market and might adversely affect the liquidity market price and price volatility of the whole foods market notes or otherwise be adverse to the interests of the holders of the whole foods market notes see the proposed amendments the liquidity of the whole foods market notes that are not exchanged will be reduced we expect that the trading market for unexchanged whole foods market notes will become more limited due to the reduction in the amount of the whole foods market notes outstanding upon consummation of the exchange offer a more limited trading market might adversely affect the liquidity market price and price volatility of these securities if a market for unexchanged whole foods market notes exists or develops those securities may trade at a discount to the price at which the securities would trade if the amount outstanding were not reduced depending on prevailing interest rates the market for similar securities and other factors however we cannot assure you that an active market in the unexchanged whole foods market notes will exist develop or be maintained or as to the prices at which the unexchanged whole foods market notes may be traded trading in the whole foods market notes may be adversely affected by the lack of information about whole foods market whole foods market has ceased reporting under sections and d of the exchange act and accordingly it will no longer provide reports or information to the sec the whole foods market trustee or holders of the whole foods market notes although we currently expect the credit rating agencies to continue to rate the whole foods market notes following completion of the exchange in the future one or more credit

advised us that its current practice is to credit participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on dtcs records upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information the underwriters or agents for the debt securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name and will be the sole responsibility of those participants book entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note so long as dtc or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security dtc or its nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt

of the participant through which that person owns its interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities the laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form these laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account we understand that under existing industry practices if we request holders to take any action or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the amazon indenture then dtc would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc and its participants for that global security the conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements

the applicable treasury regulations and therefore the discussion below assumes that the whole foods market notes are not subject to the special rules governing contingent payment debt instruments this discussion of material u s federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice each holder of notes should consult its tax advisor as to the particular tax considerations to such holder of the exchange offer and consent solicitation and the ownership and disposition of amazon notes including the applicability of u s federal state and local tax laws and non u s tax laws u s holders the exchange offer tender of whole foods market notes the exchange of whole foods market notes for amazon notes and cash pursuant to the exchange offer and consent solicitation will be a taxable exchange for u s federal income tax purposes subject to the discussion below under early participation premium a u s holder that exchanges whole foods market notes for amazon notes and cash pursuant to the exchange offer and consent solicitation generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference if any between i the sum of the amount of cash received and the issue price of the amazon notes received in respect of the whole foods market notes as discussed below under issue price reduced by an amount equal to the accrued interest on the whole foods

and ii the u s holders adjusted tax basis in the whole foods market notes a u s holders adjusted tax basis in a whole foods market note will generally equal the amount paid for the whole foods market note x increased by any market discount previously taken into account by the u s holder in respect of the whole foods market note and y reduced but not below zero by any amortizable bond premium previously amortized on the whole foods market note subject to the treatment of a portion of any gain as ordinary income to the extent of any market discount accrued on a whole foods market note see below under market discount any gain or loss recognized in respect of a whole foods market note generally will be capital gain or loss which will be long term capital gain or loss if the u s holders holding period in the whole foods market note exceeds one year as of the date of the exchange certain non corporate u s holders may be eligible for preferential tax rates in respect of long term capital gain the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations a u s holder generally will have an initial tax basis in an amazon note received pursuant to the exchange offer and consent solicitation equal to its issue price as defined below and generally will commence a new holding period with respect to the amazon note the day after the completion of the exchange table of contents market discount the market discount provisions of the code may apply to u s holders of whole foods market notes that acquired the whole foods market notes in the secondary market in general a whole foods market note that was acquired by a u s holder in the secondary market will be treated as having been acquired with market discount if the whole foods market notes principal amount exceeded the tax basis of the whole foods market note in the u s holders hands immediately after its acquisition unless such excess was less than a statutorily defined de minimis amount any gain recognized by a u s holder with respect to a whole foods market note that was acquired with market discount will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued during the period the whole foods market note was held by such u s holder unless the u s holder previously elected to include market discount in income as it accrued for u s federal income tax purposes issue price if an amazon note is considered to be publicly traded for u s federal income tax purposes the issue price of such amazon note will subject to the sentence below generally equal its fair market value on the date of issuance in accordance with applicable u s treasury regulations we intend to determine the issue price of the amazon notes by subtracting from such fair market value any amazon note pre issuance accrued interest as defined below under treatment of the amazon notesstated interest although no assurances can be given in this regard we believe that the amazon notes are likely to be considered publicly traded for these purposes and intend to take this position for all relevant reporting and other purposes we will make information about our determination of the issue price of the amazon notes available to investors in a commercially reasonable fashion within days of the date on which the amazon notes are issued our determination of the issue price of the amazon notes is binding upon a holder unless such holder explicitly discloses to the irs on a timely filed u s federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the exchange that its determination is different from ours the reasons for the different determination and how such holder determined the issue price early participation premium the u s federal income tax treatment of the receipt of the early participation premium is unclear we intend to take the position that any early participation premium is additional consideration for the tendered whole foods market notes in which case the early participation premium would be treated as part of the amount paid to the u s holder in respect of such whole foods market notes as provided above in tender of whole foods market notes alternatively the early participation premium may be treated as interest or a separate fee that would be subject to tax as ordinary income there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully challenge the position that we intend to take u s holders should consult their tax advisors about the u s federal income tax treatment of the receipt of the early participation premium treatment of the amazon notes stated interest subject to the following sentence and the conditions described below in original issue discount interest on the amazon notes will generally be included in the income of a u s holder as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with the u s holders method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes however a u s holder should not include in income the portion of the first payment of interest on an amazon note that is attributable to accrued interest on the whole foods market notes as of the time of the exchange and should instead treat such portion as a non taxable return of such pre issuance accrued interest such amount is referred to as the amazon note pre issuance accrued interest original issue discount as described above because we intend to determine the issue price of the amazon notes by reference to the fair market value of the amazon notes on the applicable exchange date we cannot know before the applicable exchange date whether the amazon notes will have original issue discount oid if the stated redemption price at maturity of any amazon note exceeds the issue price of the amazon note by at least a statutorily specified de minimis amount which is generally of one percent of the principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity the difference will constitute oid for u s federal income tax purposes a u s holder of an amazon note that is issued with oid will regardless of such u s holders method of accounting be required to include the oid in income as ordinary income as it accrues in table of contents accordance with a constant yield method based upon a compounding of interest and before receiving the cash to which that income is attributable amortizable bond premium if a u s holders initial tax basis in an amazon note is greater than the principal amount of the amazon note the u s holder will be considered to have acquired the amazon note with amortizable bond premium a u s holder generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the amazon note on a constant yield method as an offset to interest when includible in income under a u s holders regular accounting method an election to amortize premium on a constant yield method will also apply to all other taxable debt instruments held or subsequently acquired by a u s holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made such an election may not be revoked without the consent of the irs sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of amazon notes upon the sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of an amazon note a u s holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized which includes any cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on such sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition in respect of the amazon note except to the extent such cash or property is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest which will generally be taxable as ordinary income to the extent not previously included in income and the u s holders adjusted tax basis in the amazon note a u s holders adjusted tax basis in an amazon note will generally equal its initial tax basis in the amazon note x increased by any oid that it previously included in income with respect to the amazon note and y reduced by any amortizable bond premium that it previously amortized with respect to the amazon note such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of such sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition the u s holders holding period for the amazon note exceeds one year certain non corporate u s holders may be eligible for preferential tax rates in respect of long term capital gain the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations additional tax on net investment income non corporate u s holders are generally subject to a tax on the lesser of the u s holders net investment income for the relevant taxable year and the excess of the u s holders modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold which in the case of individuals will be between and depending on the individuals tax return filing status a u s holders net investment income will generally include any interest income or net gain recognized by such holder with respect to the notes unless such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities non

example article of the u s china income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a chinese student temporarily present in the united states under u s law this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the united states exceeds calendar years however paragraph of the first protocol to the u s china treaty dated april allows the provisions of article to continue to apply even after the chinese student becomes a resident alien of the united states a chinese student who qualifies for this exception under paragraph of the first
