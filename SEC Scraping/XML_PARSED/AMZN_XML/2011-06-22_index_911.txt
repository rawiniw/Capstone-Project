second paragraph on page please tell us your consideration of disclosing that you will need to accrue and pay income taxes if you repatriate cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by foreign subsidiaries and whether or not you intend to repatriate such funds response we address repatriation of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our k page where we disclose that except as required under u s tax law we do not provide for u s taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the u s we also disclose that undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside of the u s were billion at december in preparing our managements discussion and analysis we considered our disclosure of the facts described above our expectation that cash flows from u s operations are sufficient to fund our u s cash requirements for the year ended december our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances at fair value were billion and our stated intent as of such date to invest foreign subsidiary earnings outside the u s making repatriation of balances located outside of the u s not reasonably likely thus we have not disclosed the potential tax impact of repatriating cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by foreign subsidiaries if our intent to repatriate changes we would accrue the necessary deferred

taxes page we note that a substantial amount of your earnings are derived from subsidiaries outside the u s in jurisdictions where your effective tax rate is lower than in the u s please refer item a i of regulation s k and tell us your consideration of disclosing any country or countries in which foreign earnings are taxed at substantially lower rates and the related earnings response we believe the above requirements and those within section iii b of sec release have been met by disclosing in managements discussion and analysis results of operations income taxes in our k page that our effective tax rate is lower than the u s federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the u s where our effective tax rate is lower and by disclosing in managements discussion and analysis critical accounting judgments income taxes page that our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates we also disclose in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements page the full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u s statutory rate however in light of the staffs comment in our future annual reports on form k we will add the following disclosure in our managements discussion and analysis results of operations income taxes the effective tax rate in xx was lower than the u s federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the u s in jurisdictions where our effective tax rate is lower than in the u s earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the u s primarily relate to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg item financial statements and supplementary data page notes to consolidated financial statements page note description of business and accounting policies page recent accounting pronouncements page reference is made to your prospective adoption of asc on january and the resulting accounting policy for sales your kindle e reader please refer asc e and tell us your consideration of disclosing the significant factors inputs assumptions and methods used to determine estimated selling price for the significant deliverables response we have disclosed in note recent accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements in our k page that e stimated selling prices are managements best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements separately in arriving at our best estimate of the prices we would charge our customers for standalone elements if charged separately we considered customer demand prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables and the price if largely based on costs we will we add in future filings the following estimated selling prices are managements best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements separately and include considerations of customer demand prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables and the price if largely based on costs note fixed assets page reference is made to your disclosure in the second paragraph on page please tell us the specific authoritative literature you apply in determining whether or not buildings under built to suit arrangements in which you have a significant investment in tenant improvements qualify for sales recognition under the sale leaseback accounting guidance response we have concluded that buildings under build to suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy during the year ended december do not meet the definition of a normal leaseback because we have continuing involvement and therefore the buildings do not qualify as a sale leaseback under asc we have concluded that a significant portion of our tenant improvements are structural in nature and are therefore not considered normal as defined by asc by funding these building elements we have essentially provided in substance nonrecourse financing to the lessor which constitutes continuing involvement as defined under asc b note commitments and contingencies page other contingencies page please tell us your consideration of disclosing an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of the reasonable possible loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made refer to asc in addition please tell us when the state of texas sales tax contingency arose when the contingency was initially disclosed in the notes to the financial statements and why disclosure prior to such date was not required by asc response the company discloses matters in other contingencies that may have a material impact to our financial statements if we do not prevail even if the likelihood of a loss is remote when the likelihood of loss becomes reasonably possible we will disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of the reasonably possible loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made the state of texas sales tax contingency arose in september when the texas comptroller of public accounts sent the company a series of letters advising that following a field audit the comptroller had determined that at least one as yet undetermined amazon affiliated entity had a substantial nexus with the state of texas and that such entity was liable for an estimated total of up to million in uncollected state sales tax including interest and penalties the comptroller also stated that such liability would ultimately need to be paid by only one entity the company promptly disclosed this contingency in the note commitments and contingencies other contingencies to its consolidated financial statements in its next periodic report which was the companys quarterly report on form q filed on october page in that filing the company also disclosed that it believed the texas determination was without merit and that it would vigorously contest the assessment the companys determination was based upon a number of factors including the fact that pertinent u s supreme court and other state and federal precedents have established a bright line test for determining whether an out of state retailer has a sufficiently substantial nexus with the taxing state such that the state may impose consistent with the commerce clause an obligation to collect state sales tax on that out of state retailer and that this test has not been satisfied in texas with regard to amazons out of state retailer amazon com llc because that retailer has no employees physical operations subsidiaries or agents in texas accordingly under asc the company believes that it has timely and appropriately satisfied any disclosure obligations in respect of this contingency note segment information page please tell us in detail i the operating segments you have identified in accordance with asc through ii the factors used to identify reportable segments and iii the basis for aggregating identified operating segments into two reportable segments given the aggregation criteria in asc and quantitative thresholds in asc please also tell us whether discrete operating results for your kindle ereader product line is available and included in the information reports regularly reviewed by your chief operating decision maker and whether the kindle e reader product line is a component including the facts and circumstances supporting your determination in addition please refer to asc and tell us your consideration of disclosing the factors used to identify reportable segments including the basis of organization and whether operating segments have been aggregated response as the staff is aware asc defines an operating segment as a component of a business entity that has each of the three following characteristics the component engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses including start up operations and revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity the operating results of the component are regularly reviewed by the entitys chief operating decision maker codm to assess the performance of the individual component and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the component discrete financial information about the component is available our north america and international segments are our only operating and reportable segments because they are the only parts of our business for which discrete financial information is available and their operating results are regularly reviewed by our codm our operating segments are the same as our reporting segments discrete operating profits for our kindle e reader or otherindividual products and services are not regularly provided to our codm the information regularly provided to our codm to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess performance include metrics that measure our ability to provide a great customer experience selection in stock availability price delivery time customer service levels etc business initiatives and goals to grow our business and operating profits for north america and international which include sales of kindle e readers and all other products and services furthermore the information provided to our board of directors is consistent with our segment conclusions in note segments to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we disclose that we have organized our operations into two geographically based segments and include the summarized financial results of each please tell us your consideration of disclosing total expenditures for additions to long lived assets refer to asc response asc allows for flexibility and judgment as to what is to be included in long lived assets per asc the purpose of the disclosure is to provide information about assets that are potentially at greater risk because they are difficult to move and are relatively illiquid because intangible assets are generally not difficult to move we have excluded them from this disclosure in note segments to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we disclose total fixed assets and depreciation expense by segment for each year presented fixed asset disposals have been insignificant and therefore additions to fixed asset can be derived from the disclosures provided however in light of the staffs comment we will disclose additions to fixed assets in future filings please tell us your consideration of disclosing revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products and services such as the kindle e reader or disclosing that providing this information is impracticable refer to asc response we have grouped revenues from external customers into three groups of similar products and services media electronics and other general merchandise and other we have disclosed revenues for each of these groups by segment within managements discussion and analysis in our k page the kindle e reader is included in the electronics and other general merchandise group item exhibits financial statement schedules page reference is made to your disclosure in the fifth paragraph on page regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts the second full paragraph on page regarding the income tax valuation allowance the second paragraph on page regarding the salesreturnallowance and the fourth paragraph on page regarding the allowance for estimated commission refunds please refer to rule of regulation s x and tell us your consideration of disclosing activity within these accounts in schedule ii as prescribed by rule of regulation s x response in note to our consolidated financial statements in our k we disclose the allowance for doubtful customers and vendor receivables trade accounts receivable and vendor receivable balances and discussions of items that impact our recognized revenue including sales return and commission allowances we do not disclose receivable allowances or sales return and commissions returns allowance activity in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts because such activity for each of and was less than of net sales and was thus not material in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in our k page we disclose deferred tax assets as well as the balance of our valuation allowances in a tabular format in footnote to the table we disclose that our deferred tax valuation allowance r elates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of future capital gains and net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions we believe that this disclosure in footnote is useful as a majority of the fluctuation in our valuation allowance relates directly to changes to our deferred taxes relating to assets held for investment and losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions both of which can only be utilized in limited circumstances furthermore to the extent that activity occurs in the valuation allowance other than that described by footnote those changes that have a significant impact to our provision for income taxes are disclosed in the effective tax rate reconciliation in our income tax footnote page we believe that the disclosures in note provide all the elements that would be required in schedule ii as prescribed by rule of regulation s x conclusion we hereby acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in its filings staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing and the company may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the united states if you have any
