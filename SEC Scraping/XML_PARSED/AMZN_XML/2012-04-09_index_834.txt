zappos customer accounts full credit card numbers were not accessed the data accessed included customer names e mail addresses billing and shipping addresses phone numbers credit card type the last few digits of credit card numbers and expiration dates i e the standard information found on receipts and or cryptographically scrambled passwords but not actual passwords we evaluated this matter prior to filing the k including the nature of the breach and determined that in light of our disclosures in the risk factor we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches information on the specific incident would not provide investors with additional material information relating to the cyber attack risks facing our business we supplementally advise the staff that this incident did not have a material impact on amazons business as zappos is not material to our consolidated revenues in addition we believed that due to the nature of the cyber attack any impact on zappos business

stringent security measures as the sensitivity of the information increases we have also implemented compensating controls to minimize the risk of loss or misuse of confidential information in the event of a security breach at a third party vendor in future filings we will revise our disclosure in the risk factor captioned we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches to read as

financial condition and results of operations page results of operations page please tell us your consideration of quantifying to the extent practicable the effect of the factors contributing to increases in fulfillment marketing and technology and content costs please also tell us your consideration of discussing why fulfillment marketing and technology and content costs increased as a percentage of net sales response we believe we meet the intent of managements discussion and analysis by providing readers with the information necessary to understand our results of operations we have used a tabular format to present relevant financial information including three years of operating expense amounts year over year growth rates and operating expenses as a percent of sales this tabular presentation is followed by a narrative discussion and analysis of each operating expense category in drafting this narrative we analyzed the drivers contributing to the changes in fulfillment marketing and technology and content costs in and compared to the comparable prior year periods and listed the drivers in order of significance the factors disclosed represent recurring components of these expense categories for the periods presented because the recurring drivers remain relatively consistent we do not believe quantifying is necessary to enable investors and other users to assess the results of operations we have quantified and will continue to do so material nonrecurring drivers of change affecting comparability or when we believe the additional disclosure is necessary to an understanding of our results of operations for example on our form q for the quarterly period ended september we quantified the components of equity method activity and on our form q for the quarterly period ended march we quantified the estimated impact of the japan earthquake and related events please tell us your consideration of discussing why the effective tax rate increased significantly from fiscal to response we quantitatively disclosed the changes in our effective tax rate through the components of our side by side reconciliation of the statutory rate to our effective tax rate for and in note income taxes we believe the rate reconciliation provides investors information necessary to understand the changes in our effective tax rate in and the rate reconciliation in note discloses the factors contributing to the year over year change including the effects of the foreign tax differential state taxes tax credits and nondeductible stock based compensation in our managements discussion and analysis we include discussion that emphasizes the impact of the foreign tax differential when we disclose the favorable effective tax rate impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions is offset by other items principally losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we may not be able to realize a related tax benefit the year over year change in the effective tax rate is also impacted by the characteristics of our income base which is described as follows depending upon the jurisdictional mix and amount of our income in the losses for which we may not receive a tax benefit in could result in an effective tax rate that is higher than the u s federal statutory rate we believe that these disclosures provided investors with the information necessary to understand why the effective tax rate increased from fiscal to item financial statements and supplementary data page please provide us with your income significance test supporting your determination that the financial statements of livingsocial are not required to be filed pursuant to rule of regulation s x response the income significance test as required by rule and outlined in rule w of regulation s x

livingsocials pre tax income adjusted for basis differences this amount excludes gains recorded as a result of equity ownership changes consistent with the guidance in section measuring significance of equity method investees under s x in the division of corporation finance financial reporting manual the denominator for the income significance test was million which represents our income before income taxes as adjusted to include equity method investment activity in accordance with computational note to rule w we excluded our equity in the losses of livingsocial in determining our income in millions amazon income before income taxes equity method investment activity equity in losses of livingsocial numerator adjusted income before income taxes denominator test result inclusive of our equity in livingsocials losses given the above significance test we concluded that livingsocial financial statements are not required to be filed pursuant to rule of regulation s x consolidated statements of operations page please tell us your consideration of stating separately cost of products and cost of services refer to rule of regulation s x response we believe disclosure of our total cost structure by functional category i e fulfillment marketing technology and content and general and administrative provides investors and other users of the financial statements a full picture of our cost structure and the ability to evaluate how that cost structure is being leveraged by our product and service sales furthermore in note description of business and accounting policies we provide a detailed description of the components of these costs which are shared among product and service offerings we jointly manage these offerings by leveraging the shared infrastructure and therefore primarily focus on operating profits not cost of product or cost of services for example our fulfillment network supports both sales where we are the seller of record and seller services where we earn a commission or service fee therefore separate disclosure would not reflect the way we manage our business we note your disclosure on page that equity method investment activity net of tax includes gains of million as a result of reductions in your equity ownership and a recovery on the sale of an equity position please tell us your consideration of classifying these gains as non operating income or separately stating gains losses from the equity pickup in your response please include your consideration of predominant practice in classifying gains or losses on investments response in accordance with regulation s x rule b we report our equity in the earnings losses of equity method investees equity pickup amortization of basis differences dilution gains and losses caused by investees equity transactions and other transaction gains and losses associated with our equity method investees after the income tax provision on our statement of operations we believe diversity in practice exists in the classification of other gains and losses related to these investments in our managements discussion and analysis we disclose the components of equity method activity as follows the increase in equity method investment activity in compared to is primarily due to million of equity method losses partially offset by gains of million as a result of reductions in our equity ownership through dilution and a recovery on the sale of an equity position we do not believe disaggregating the information would provide a better understanding of our equity method investments because of the complexity of earnings and losses related to these investments we believe presenting the activity in a single line supplemented with the disclosure as provided in our managements discussion and analysis identifying material components of the item provides a comprehensive view of our equity method activity conclusion we hereby acknowledge that the company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action
