existing and potential investments the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project representing institutional investors globally with approximately trillion in assets calls for company disclosure on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change management programs over two thirds of the sp now report to cdp amazon has minimal disclosure on how it manages esg issues by contrast the companys peers including intel microsoft google and target have much more comprehensive sustainability reporting providing goals identifying areas of focus and data on their progress public disclosure of this information allows investors to learn more about how management is addressing near and long term risks e g operational reputational and regulatory and opportunities reporting on the companys impact on climate change is particularly crucial as it is one of the most financially significant environmental issues currently facing investors we believe no firm is immune to the prospect of future carbon regulations or the physical impacts of climate change in addition investors have an interest in understanding how the company manages labor and human rights issues working conditions in amazons warehouses have drawn scrutiny and labor and human rights issues in corporate supply chains are important for any company involved with retail sales data on occupational safety and health vendor and labor standards waste and water reduction targets are important business considerations not managing these issues properly could pose significant regulatory legal reputational and financial risks while sustainability reporting is not yet required in the us it is increasingly expected by companies shareholders and stakeholders investors are continually monitoring and evaluating the esg

beneficial owner of shares of common stock of the company has notified us that it intends to present the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a vote against this shareholder proposal beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support by newground social investment whereas a majority of sp companies have webpages dedicated to disclosure of political and trade association spending the council of institutional investors the voice of corporate governance represents more than trillion in combined assets its policy states the board should develop and disclose publicly its guidelines for approving political contributions and should disclose the amounts and recipients of all contributions made by the company including expenditures earmarked for political or charitable activities that were provided to or through a third party the us securities and exchange commission has under consideration a disclosure rulemaking which has received more than million comments in support of a rulemakingfar more than ever submitted on any rulemaking petition in history shareowners have a right to know whether and how their company uses resources for political purposes yet existing regulatory frameworks create barriersbecause disclosure is either dispersed among regulatory authorities or entirely absent when spending is channeled through independent organizations exempt from naming donors amazon has at times placed a brief political spending statement on its website however key elements are absent from the statement such that amazon ranks quite poorly in the cpa zicklin index of corporate accountability and disclosure which ranks companies according to the quality of their reporting at amazon treads water in the th tier and scores well behind ebay at intel at and northwest peers microsoft at in the ranking boeing at and starbucks at amazon could significantly elevate its rank by putting into place a handful of essential but missing elements we view these steps as constituting low hanging fruitstraightforward measures for amazon to take but important for our companys reputation and beneficial to shareholder value the board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the risks associated with amazons political use of corporate assets therefore be it resolved shareholders request a report updated semiannually that discloses amazons a policies and procedures for making political contributions and expenditures with corporate funds both direct and indirect including the boards role if any

deductible under irc section e the initial report shall be made available within months of the annual meeting and should identify recipients as well as the amount s paid to each recipient from company funds end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by newground social investment recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal we have posted on our website atwww amazon com ir a political expenditures statement which is updated annually as noted in our political expenditures statement our political expenditures are approved by our vice president of global public policy reviewed by our senior vice president for corporate affairs and general counsel and reported on to our audit committee in january we made several enhancements to our annual political expenditures report to include disclosure of each u s based trade association to which we contribute at least through the companys public policy office and

beneficial ownership of such shares includes shares beneficially owned by other executive officers not individually listed in the table and shares as to which one of the other executive officers may be deemed to share voting and investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the companys letter to shareholders we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as a result we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies for example under our compensation philosophy we have prioritized stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time in addition we believe granting stock based compensation to employees at all levels across the company results in motivated customer centric people who think and act like owners because they are owners our compensation philosophy for our named executive officers identified in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our employees and is governed by the following principles first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests third our compensation program emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as a basis for compensation increases as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values including customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like owners and thinking long term a high hiring bar and frugality for our named executive officers who are employed on an at will basis we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or change in control benefits for our executive officers except as noted below we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to performance criteria which could cause employees to focus solely on short term returns at the expense of long term growth and innovation base salaries consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for messrs jassy piacentini and wilke due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon com mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year for example because annual total compensation as reported in the summary compensation table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that year without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years a named executive officers total compensation as reported will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon com since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of six years vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a change in control unless the acquiring company does not assume the awards for new hire grants and grants made in connection with internal promotions the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon com the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance including our core values and expected contributions to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price appreciation assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in june mr olsavsky received a restricted stock unit award for shares with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr olsavskys experience and skill supporting his appointment to chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions except for mr olsavsky the named executive officers did not receive any new equity awards in in evaluating the compensation of our named executive officers in the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet and technology companies including aol apple best buy cisco dell ebay facebook google honeywell ibm intel microsoft oracle starbucks target verizon and yahoo the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data at the time of grant we impose additional vesting conditions on certain stock based awards issued to named executive officers so that the awards may qualify as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code however the company or the leadership development and compensation committee may grant awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under section m and there is no guarantee that awards intended to qualify for tax deductibility under section m will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service new hire cash bonuses none of the named executive officers received a new hire cash bonus in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees we provide security for mr bezos including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit and that the amount of the reported security expenses is especially reasonable in light of mr bezos low salary and the fact that he has never received any stock based compensation the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of mr bezos security expenses reportable security expenses along with mr piacentinis expatriation benefits including a cost of living and housing allowance are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers shareholder advisory vote to approve executive compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers with more than of the votes cast for approval of our executive compensation on an advisory basis the leadership development and compensation committee evaluated the results of the advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as well as discussions we have had in recent years with our shareholders and the other factors discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis when evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices while each of these factors informed the leadership development and compensation committees decisions regarding our executive compensation program the leadership development and compensation committee did not implement changes to our executive compensation program as a result of the shareholder advisory vote leadership development and compensation committee report the leadership development and compensation committee which is composed solely of independent members of the board of directors assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to among other things establishing and reviewing compensation of the companys executive officers the leadership development and compensation committee reviewed and discussed with management the companys compensation
