evidence showing clear correlationsbetween esg performance and financial performance ernst youngs recent report on esg reporting cited several studies that established significant and positive correlations between esg or sustainability performance and financial performance including a meta study by oxford university and arabesque asset management that concluded that solid esg practices were associated withbetter operational performance and a study from harvard and the london business school that found that high sustainability companies outperform peers in the long run on both stock price and accounting performance ernst young is your nonfinancial performance revealing the true value of your business to investors http www ey com gl en services assurance climate change and

than academic studies of sustainable investing two literature reviews and four meta studies the authors arrive at our conclusion thatfirms with strong esg performance may now be enjoying both financial outperformance particularly market based and a lower risk as measured by the cost of equity and or debt both loans and bonds capital in the short run this theoretical anomaly achieving higher return at lower risk results from market inefficiencies and presents a major investment opportunity investors and companies that exploit this inefficiency will benefit from an early mover

asset management llc shareholder proposal number at amazon page amazon has not explicitly linked sustainability goals including metrics regarding diversity and inclusion with senior executive incentives this is despite the fact that amazon has taken certain steps to address environmental social and governance esg issues investors seek clarity on how amazon drives sustainability improvement and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability intentionally and transparently integrating sustainability into compensation performance measures would enhance amazons approach amazon faces serious corporate sustainability challenges which merit an enhanced approach in the opposing statement to proposal number amazon states that it believes strongly in integrating environmental social and governance considerations into our business strategy amazon points to its recently announced shipment zero initiative and certain disclosures describing human capital efforts however such reporting does not offer a satisfactory account of several challenges that drive significant long term risks for amazon according to the research firm sustainalytics over the past three years amazon has faced issues with both its warehouse logistics staff as well as its office it staff wage and overtime disputes with amazons warehouse employees have led to strikes in germany and financial compensation claims in the us amazons office work environment has also been the subject of negative media reports these describe an exhausting and hostile work environment harming employees mental health however these reports have been publicly rebutted by amazon the company s preparedness to manage labour relations appears relatively weak given that it does not disclose freedom of association and working conditions policies which are considered best practice amazon faced controversy in when a german media outlet reported that amazon destroyed products instead of recycling or reselling them the report indicated that the company destroyed not only defective goods but also usable ones groups of amazon employees have also expressed vocal opposition to the companys recent efforts to do business with polluting oil companies and the pentagon these controversies have harmed morale as well as the companys reputation in the media beyond such issues amazon faces especially urgent risks

organization our insights women in the workplace zevin asset management llc shareholder proposal number at amazon page the inclusion crisis in tech creates challenges for talent acquisition and retention product development and customer service these human capital risks are playing out at amazon bloomberg businessweek has argued that among the major tech companies struggling with diversity and inclusion amazon is one of the bigger sinners amazon has taken steps to address diversity and inclusion notably by improving disclosure improving diversity on the board of directors and providing resources for underrepresented workers however these steps have not been enough to make meaningful progress against challenges despite recent moves to diversify the board of directors amazon remains predominantly white and male especially in leadership roles among amazons top executives in according to the most recenteeo report made available just percent were women and only one executive was an underrepresented person of color according to the abovebloomberg businessweekreport o f the people who report directly to chief executive officer jeff bezos all are white and only one is a woman clearly amazons management approach to inclusion lacks momentum and directionality the above also reflects deep challenges of racial and gender injustice which put investor value at risk a successful approach to inclusion is essential particularly in the technology sector where companies like amazon rely on the ability to attract promote and retain the most talented individuals wherever they are and whatever they look like amazon stands to realize significant opportunities if it can improve its approach to diversity and inclusion mckinsey company research shows that companies in the top quartiles for gender and racial ethnic diversity were more likely to have above average financial returns diversity matters mckinsey in a catalyst report diversity was positively associated with more customers increased sales revenue and greater relative profits in the intel dalberg cited above it was estimated that the technology sector could generate billion in additional annual revenue if tech companies reflected the racial diversity of the talent pool proponents believe that amazon should consider linking a portion of executive compensation to its own chosen diversity and inclusion metrics this would demonstrate that senior executive management oversees the inclusion strategy in a way that is accountable transparent and oriented around success linking executive compensation to sustainability and diversity metrics would also improve amazons chances of addressing the challenges discussed above however in spite of the above challenges our company without proper explanation or justification has dismissed proposal number investors should know that our boards position on proposal number contradicts an impressive body of research and peer practice amazon has a rare chance to get more diverse fast bloomberg businessweek amazon diversity website https www aboutamazon com working at amazon diversity and inclusion diversity and inclusion at amazon zevin asset management llc shareholder proposal number at amazon page the practice of linking executive pay to esg performance has been gaining momentum in recent years according to glass lewis percent of companies from the sp and other leading global indices linked at least some executive compensation to at least one sustainability criterion up from percent in in a study of the tsx percent were found to include sustainability measures in their annual incentive plans a large and diverse group of companies has integrated sustainability metrics into executive pay incentive plans among themalcoa unilever pepsico walmart and danone amazons own tech sector peers such as microsoft intel and ibm have set diversity goals and begun tying parts of executive pay to such goals at this point in time amazons state of practice lags behind these key peers and the company risks ceding an advantage in sustainability risk management and human capital health according to the glass lewis reportin depth linking compensation to sustainability there is a mounting body of research showing that firms that operate in a more responsible manner may perform better financially moreover these companies were also more likely to tie top executive incentives to sustainability metrics a report prepared by the united nations program on responsible investment whose members collectively own or manage trillion in aum stated that the inclusion of appropriate environmental social and governance esg issues within executive management goals and incentive schemes can be an important factor in the creation and protection of long term shareholder value it recommended the following companies should adopt a clear process for identifying appropriate esg metrics that relate to sustainable shareholder returns and company strategy companies should link appropriate esg metrics to reward systems in such a way that they form a meaningful component of the overall remuneration framework companies should endeavor to disclose the rationale method and challenges presented by the incorporation of esg metrics into executive pay clearly and concisely the increasing incorporation of sustainability metrics into executive pay evaluative criteria stems from the growing recognition that sustainability strategies can drive growth and enhance profitability and shareholder value according to the largest study of

proposal number at amazon page proponents rebut the boards response to proposal number the board argues while it would be possible to integrate performance metrics including sustainability metrics into the vesting conditions that apply to executives under our compensation arrangements we believe that our existing executive compensation arrangements tightly align senior executive compensation with amazons long term success the compensation arrangements referenced by the board are nothing more than stock based compensation which on its own lacks the directionality and accountability that the proponents seek such arrangements are no substitute for tying senior executive compensation to intentional goals performance measures and metrics a practice that has proven effective across the corporate sector the fact remains that amid minimal progress on inclusion and roiling controversies on a range of other environmental and social issues our company has not explicitly linked its material sustainability metrics with the important lever of senior executive compensation amazon has not acknowledged the clear investor value market advantage and simple good sense of establishing those links in this sense the proponents believe that amazon is missing key opportunities to drive sustainability performance promote long term investor value and seize leadership in the marketplace
