regarding non gaap financial measures exhibit non gaap financial measures regulation g conditions for use of non gaap financial measures and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information our measure of free cash flow meets the definition of a non gaap financial measure free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating activities is cash flow from operations reduced by purchases of fixed assets including internal use software and website development we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows for a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with gaap see supplemental financial information and business metrics in exhibit to this current report on form k return on invested capital is a ratio based on free cash flow and as such is also a non gaap financial measure return on invested capital is trailing twelve months free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion if any of our long term debt over the most recent five quarter ends we believe return on invested capital is a useful measure in assessing whether we are utilizing our capital efficiently as with free cash flow return on invested capital is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and return on invested capital should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures we include return on
