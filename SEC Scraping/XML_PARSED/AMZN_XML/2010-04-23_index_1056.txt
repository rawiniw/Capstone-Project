item of part ii managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our annual report on form k critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companysfinancial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item of part ii financial statements and supplementary data note description of business and accounting policies of our annual report on form k and item of part i financial statements note accounting policies of this form q although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions inventories inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain as a measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately million for q table of contents goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any during the quarter management monitored the actual performance relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that require an update to our annual impairment test as a measure of sensitivity decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of december would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged decrease from our march closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amount that will be forfeited and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee class economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately million impact on our q consolidated operating income our estimated forfeiture rates at march and december were and we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for recognizing compensation expense under this method over of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four year vesting term the accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures if forfeited early in the life of an award the forfeited amount is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight line method income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the u s and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in table of contents the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made if we determine that additional portions of our deferred tax assets are realizable the majority of the benefit will come from the assets associated with the stock based compensation that was not recognized in the financial statements but was claimed on the tax return since this compensation did not originally run through our consolidated statements of operations the benefit generated will be recorded to stockholders equity recent accounting pronouncements see item of part i

cash flow to cash provided by operating activities the increase in free cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended march compared to the comparable prior year period was due to increased operating income changes in working capital and increased deferred revenue partially offset by increased capital expenditures operating cash flows and free cash flows can be volatile and are sensitive to many factors including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms valuation of cash equivalents and marketable securities and fluctuations in foreign exchange

processing and related transaction costs and operating leases cash received from customers sellers developers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales because our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from customers settle quickly changes to our operating cash flows have historically been driven primarily by changes in operating income and

inventory velocity means we collect from our customers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was for both q and q we expect some variability in inventory turnover over time as

table of contents and by other sellers our continuing focus on in stock inventory availability our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize outsource fulfillment providers we believe that current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next

equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional lines of credit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all results of operations we have organized our operations into two

recent accounting pronouncements offset by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing consolidated gross profit and gross margin for each of the periods presented was as follows three months endedmarch gross profit in millions gross margin gross margin decreased compared to the comparable prior year period due primarily to lower prices for our customers including free shipping offers and amazon prime offset by changes in product category and service mix including the impact of zappos which we acquired in q we believe that income from operations is table of contents a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services in addition our focus is on growing profit dollars rather than maximizing margin percentages fulfillment the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period relates to variable costs corresponding with sales volume and inventory levels our mix of product sales payment processing and related transaction costs including mix of payment methods and costs from our guarantee for certain seller transactions and costs from expanding fulfillment capacity fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs including those from our guarantee for certain seller transactions our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self service features additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of revenue versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory levels and meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we periodically evaluate our facility requirements as necessary marketing we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising e mail campaigns and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense or its effect marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period due to increased spending in variable online marketing channels such as our associates program and sponsored search programs and television advertising while costs associated with free shipping are not included in marketing expense we view free shipping offers and amazon prime as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely technology and content we seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content including seller platforms aws digital initiatives and expansion of new and existing product categories as well as technology infrastructure so that we can continue to enhance the customer experience improve our process efficiency and support our infrastructure web

america segment infrastructure and other technology costs used to support our aws business are included in technology and content general and administrative the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in q compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees stock based compensation compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value on date of grant and recognized using an accelerated method over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures employee class the economic environment and historical experience actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates stock based compensation was million and million during q and q the increase in stock based compensation is primarily attributable to an increase in total stock compensation value granted to our employees and a decrease in our estimated forfeiture rate other operating expense income

prevailing rates we are earning on them which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested income taxes our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items if any that are taken into account in the relevant period there is a potential for significant volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors including from variability in accurately predicting our taxable income the taxable jurisdictions to which it relates business acquisitions and investments and foreign currencies see item of part i financial statements note income taxes table of contents we have current tax benefits and net operating losses relating to excess stock based compensation deductions that

the definition of non gaap financial measures free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures free cash flow which we reconcile to net cash provided by used in operating activities is cash flow from operations reduced by purchases of fixed assets including internal use software and website development we use free cash flow and ratios based on it to conduct and evaluate our business because although it is similar to cash flow from operations we believe it typically will present a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows table of contents the following is a

from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock based compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrally incurred operating costs stock based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements operating expenses without stock based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock based compensation our cash salary expense included in the

carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks we face intense competition our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail e commerce services digital content and digital media devices and web services many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers and greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand into our market segments in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web services and digital may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings which include digital web services electronic devices and seller focused offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected table of contents our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the u s or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth our net sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive websites products services price decreases or improvements changes in usage of the internet and e commerce including in non u s markets timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer free shipping continue to reduce product prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions and similar events and terrorist attacks and armed hostilities we may not be successful in our efforts to expand into international market segments our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation of e commerce other online services and electronic devices and restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership table of contents restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internet friendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption and restrictions on pricing or discounts lower levels of use of the internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the u s lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employee employer relationships and the existence of workers councils and labor unions laws and policies of the u s and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and geopolitical events including war and terrorism as the international e commerce channel grows competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth in we acquired joyo com limited which is organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and through a peoples republic of china prc entity provides technology and services for the joyo amazon websites the prc regulates joyo amazons business through regulations and license requirements restricting i foreign investment in the internet retail and delivery sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements joyo amazons business is operated by prc companies owned by nominee shareholders who are prc nationals although we believe joyo amazons structure complies with existing prc laws it involves unique risks there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc laws and regulations and it is possible that the prc government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours if joyo amazon including its subsidiary and affiliates were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change the business could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have its licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely in addition if joyo amazon were unable to enforce its contractual relationships with respect to management and control of its business it might be unable to continue to operate the business if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment centers our business could be harmed if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient inventory or fulfillment capacity result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways a failure to optimize inventory will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are table of contents fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for drop shipping we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers as we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capability or add new businesses with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment centers there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors third parties either drop ship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment centers our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades split shipments and additional long zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory we generally have payment terms with our vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers as a result of holiday sales at december of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable at december our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships we provide e commerce services to other businesses through our seller programs and other commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide technology fulfillment and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites and power their websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial personnel and resource table of contents commitments by us which may limit the agreements we are able to enter into and our ability to integrate and deliver services under them if we fail to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing licensing of third party software hardware and content and engaging third parties to perform hosting and other services these initiatives may not be viable the amount of compensation we receive under certain of these agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales therefore if the other companys offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results our present and future e commerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible assets such as inventory and intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries table of contents as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other than temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results we have foreign exchange risk the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents and or marketable securities primarily in euros british pounds and japanese yen if the u s dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our systems may affect our sales customer access to our websites and the speed with which a customer navigates and makes purchases on our websites affect our net sales operating results and the attractiveness of our products and services we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which would make our product and service offerings less attractive our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy we face significant inventory risk in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment center and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and or sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component table of contents selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual

to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own in providing e commerce services to other businesses and individuals under commercial agreements these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item a as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the internet and the e commerce industry quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet related companies in particular table of contents changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other e commerce or technology companies and transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both government regulation of the internet e commerce and other aspects of our business is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet e commerce and electronic devices existing

and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce jurisdictions may regulate consumer to consumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business taxation risks could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease we do not collect sales or other taxes on shipments of most of our goods into most states in the u s under some of our commercial agreements the other company is the seller of record and we are obligated to collect sales tax in accordance with that companys instructions we may enter into additional agreements requiring similar tax collection obligations our fulfillment center and customer service center networks and any future expansion of them along with other aspects of our evolving business may result in additional sales and other tax obligations currently u s supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales made over the internet however a number of states as well as the u s congress have been considering or adopted initiatives that could limit or supersede the supreme courts position regarding sales and use taxes on internet sales if these initiatives are successful we could be required to collect sales and use taxes in additional states or change our business practices the imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon internet commerce could create administrative burdens for us put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on all of our online competitors and decrease our future sales we collect consumption tax including value added tax goods and services tax and provincial sales tax as applicable on goods and services sold by us that are ordered on our international sites additional foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers and otherwise harm our business table of contents we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our worldwide provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations principles and interpretations we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made our vendor relationships subject us to a number of risks we have significant vendors that are important to our sourcing manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have long term arrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current vendors were to stop selling merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all we may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our e commerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability we are subject to payments related risks we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift certificates direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery as we offer new payment options to our customers we may be subject to additional regulations compliance requirements and fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we are also subject to payment card association operating rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected we also offer co branded credit card programs that represent a significant component of our services revenue if one or more of these agreements are terminated and we are unable to replace them on similar terms or at all it could adversely affect our operating results table of contents in addition we qualify as a money services business in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf in these jurisdictions we may be subject to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding the handling of transferred funds and consumer disclosures we are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our payments services business we could be liable for breaches of security although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions under our a z guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods from selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers item unregistered sales of equity securities and use of
