report on planning for disruptions posed by climate change and reduction in fossil fuel dependence filed by amazon employees for climate justice contact john mixon john mixon hotmail com dear amazon shareholder we urge you to vote for proposal at amazons annual meeting on may the proposal requests that amazons board of directors prepare a public report as soon as practicable describing how amazon is planning for disruptions posed by climate change and how amazon is reducing its company wide dependence on fossil fuels the report should be prepared at reasonable expense and may exclude confidential information we believe support for this proposal is warranted for the following reasons amazon has already experienced numerous adverse events related to climate change and faces increasing regulatory and reputational risks related to climate despite this amazon has released no information that allows investors to assess a its plans for responding to climate disruptions and mitigating climate risk b its greenhouse gas ghg emissions and fossil fuel reliance c its goals and progress toward reducing that reliance in other words amazon has not made it possible to assess how climate factors into amazons strategy to create long term growth or to mitigate risk amazon lags its peers when it comes to climate change related disclosure and action while it has promised company wide carbon footprint disclosure later this year it has not made any comprehensive commitments existing commitments such as shipment zero are open ended not comprehensive and lack context amazons peers have made disclosures and commitments on ghg emissions with far more speed and thoroughness amazon has not empowered its internal leadership on environmental issues amazon s most senior sustainability officer operates four levels below from ceo jeff bezos comparatively sustainability leaders at microsoft apple walmart and ups are at no more than two levels below the highest leadership level the sustainability leader at apple reports directly to the ceo tim cook over amazon employees estimated of total workforce and of corporate employees have publicly declared their support for this resolution leadership on climate offers amazon an edge in recruiting high skill employees lagging on the issue makes amazon a less attractive employer rationale amazon is both affected by and contributes to climate change yet despite numerous climate events affecting the companys operations clear risks to its reputation and brand repeated requests to reveal its greenhouse gas ghg emissions risks to employee recruiting and retention and systemic climate risks that amazons business is exposed to the company has still not disclosed its exposure nor risk mitigation plan while amazons statement of opposition lists many of amazons sustainability initiatives as evidence that it is already implementing this resolution these initiatives do not constitute a company wide plan nor clarify amazons overall framework for approaching climate change they do not address the disruptions caused by climate change most importantly they do not give investors the means to understand how climate change factors into amazons strategy to maintain long term growth or to mitigate risk amazon has failed to adequately disclose its climate related business risks a study published in nature indicates that the costs of climate change are in the trillions of dollars but the climate driven financial risk reported by all companies collectively was at least orders of magnitude smaller amazon is a prime example of a company that is not adequately disclosing or accounting for the risks to its business due to climate change the following events are representative of climate change disruptions that have been reported publicly by the media without disclosure of the costs mitigation efforts or on going risks from amazon june an amazon web services aws data center in sydney australia went down during severe weather which broke rainfall records june phoenixs airport cancelled flights during a record tying heat wave at degrees airplanes struggle to take off and land disrupted flights are expected to occur in more cities serviced by amazon air march a data center supporting aws suffered a power outage during superstorm riley disrupting amazon alexa november a tornado in baltimore smashed an amazon fulfilment center ruined its merchandise and killed two workers november californias camp fire temporarily shuttered amazons sacramento fulfilment center delaying deliveries feb extreme cold temperatures f in minnesota from a polar vortex shut down a fulfillment center for multiple days amazons failure to provide esg and sustainability reporting creates investor risk in an environment of increasing financial and regulatory risk around climate change in april a group of central banks around the world warned of the strong risk that climate related financial risks are not fully reflected in asset valuations amazons lack of transparency about and planning for its climate risk means that investors cannot assess the companys exposure to significant financial risk in the event of energy price volatility caused by energy demand or supply fluctuations or changes in government energy policy amazon could face financial risk in such scenarios due to the companys over reliance on fossil fuels as evidenced by large investments in data centers in virginia a state still mostly powered by fossil fuels and amazons recent purchase of diesel vans for its delivery fleet without disclosure on ghg emissions amazons exposure to regulatory risk is largely unknown especially in an environment when rapid regulation around emissions is likely public support for action climate has increased globally and in the united states with a global median of now believing it is a very serious problem given that nations and the european union have signed the paris climate agreement which amazon publicly supported the likelihood of significant legislation and taxation is rising in multiple amazon markets https www nature com articles s epdf

shareholder evaluation as an example the goal to install solar panels on fulfillment centers fcs by comes without reference to total scale what is not shared is that fulfillment centers represent only of amazons fc footprint similarly amazon provides data such as reduced packaging by tens of thousands of boxes or growing number of low pollution electric vans to demonstrate its commitments but it does not provide any data to put these numbers in context making it virtually impossible for shareholders to evaluate amazons actions other plans come without a timeline such as amazons goal to achieve renewables amazons shipment zero announcement a goal to make of all amazon shipments to customers net zero in carbon emissions by does not commit to any net reduction in fossil fuel usage or ghg emissions given amazons growth rate greening of shipments by will likely mean a net increasein the climate impact of amazons shipping operations relative to the current baseline as cities

framework for identifying material esg issues identifies energy consumed by infrastructure data privacy data security product end of life management managing systemic risks from technology disruptions and competitive behavior and open internet as material esg considerations with billion in revenue from aws alone this presents a materially large exposure for amazon shareholders the company has

climate change management including setting ghg goals generate superior profitability have lower volatility of earnings achieve higher dividend growth and exhibit other attributes that are valuable to investors amazons failure to address climate risks may lead to reputational costs related to public perception and employee recruitment inaction on climate is threatening amazons ability to attract
