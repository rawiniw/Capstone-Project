company ever to reach billion in annual sales also this year amazon web services is reaching billion in annual sales doing so at a pace even faster than amazon achieved that milestone whats going on here both were planted as tiny seeds and both have grown organically without significant acquisitions into meaningful and large businesses quickly superficially the two could hardly be more different one serves consumers and the other serves enterprises one is famous for brown boxes and the other for apis is it only a coincidence that two such dissimilar offerings grew so quickly under one roof luck plays an outsized role in every endeavor and i can assure you weve had a bountiful supply but beyond that there is a connection between these two businesses under the surface the two are not so different after all they share a distinctive organizational culture that cares deeply about and acts with conviction on a small number of principles im talking about customer obsession rather than competitor obsession eagerness to invent and pioneer willingness to fail the patience to think long term and the taking of professional pride in operational excellence through that lens aws and amazon retail are very similar indeed a word about corporate cultures for better or for worse they are enduring stable hard to change they can be a source of advantage or disadvantage you can write down your corporate culture but when you do so youre discovering it uncovering it not creating it it is created slowly over time by the people and by events by the stories of past success and failure that become a deep part of the company lore if its a distinctive culture it will fit certain people like a custom made glove the reason cultures are so stable in time is because people self select someone energized by competitive zeal may select and be happy in one culture while someone who loves to pioneer and invent may choose another the world thankfully is full of many high performing highly distinctive corporate cultures we never claim that our approach is the right one just that its ours and over the last two decades weve collected a large group of like minded people folks who find our approach energizing and meaningful one area where i think we are especially distinctive is failure i believe we are the best place in the world to fail we have plenty of practice and failure and invention are inseparable twins to invent you have to experiment and if you know in advance that its going to work its not an experiment most large organizations embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right given a ten percent chance of a times payoff you should take that bet every time but youre still going to be wrong nine times out of ten we all know that if you swing for the fences youre going to strike out a lot but youre also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can get is four in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score runs this long tailed distribution of returns is why its important to be bold big winners pay for so many experiments aws marketplace and prime are all examples of bold bets at amazon that worked and were fortunate to have those three big pillars they have helped us grow into a large company and there are certain things that only large companies can do with a tip of the hat to our seattle neighbors no matter how good an entrepreneur you are youre not going to build an all composite in your garage startup not one youd want to fly in anyway used well our scale enables us to build services for customers that we could otherwise never even contemplate but also if were not vigilant and thoughtful size could slow us down and diminish our inventiveness as i meet with teams across amazon i am continually amazed at the passion intelligence and creativity on display our teams accomplished a lot in the last year and id like to share a few of the highlights of our efforts to nourish and globalize our three big offerings prime marketplace and aws and while ill focus on those three i assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth prime we want prime to be such a good value youd be irresponsible not to be a member weve grown prime two day delivery selection from million items to over million added sunday delivery and introduced free same day delivery on hundreds of thousands of products for customers in more than cities around the world weve added music photo storage the kindle owners lending library and streaming films and tv prime now offers members one hour delivery on an important subset of selection and was launched only days after it was dreamed up in that time a small team built a customer facing app secured a location for an urban warehouse determined which items to sell got those items stocked recruited and on boarded new staff tested iterated designed new software for internal use both a warehouse management system and a driver facing app and launched in time for the holidays today just months after that first city launch prime now is serving members in more than cities around the world prime video offers exclusives from some of the worlds most passionate storytellers we want brilliant creators like jill soloway jason schwartzman and spike lee to take risks and push boundaries our original series have already earned more than nominations and won nearly awards including golden globe and emmy awards many of these are stories that might never have been told in the traditional linear programming model in the pipeline and coming soon are new series and movies from creators like jeremy clarkson david e kelley woody allen and kenneth lonergan the man in the high castle based on the philip k dick novel explores an alternate history where the u s lost world war ii it debuted on prime video on november th and in four weeks became our most viewed show receiving acclaim from critics like amazon has the best new drama of the season in the man in the high castle and the man in the high castle accomplishes so much where most new broadcast tv dramas these days dont even try these shows are great for customers and they feed the prime flywheel prime members who watch prime video are more likely to convert from a free trial to a paid membership and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions finally our first ever prime day surpassed all our expectations more new members tried prime that day than any other day in our history worldwide order growth increased over the same day the year before and sellers whose products are prime eligible through fba saw record breaking sales with growth nearing prime has become an all you can eat physical digital hybrid that members love membership grew last year including growth in the u s and even faster internationally and there are now tens of millions of members worldwide theres a good chance youre already one of them but if youre not please be responsible join prime marketplace we took two big swings and missed with auctions and zshops before we launched marketplace over years ago we learned from our failures and stayed stubborn on the vision and today close to of units sold on amazon are sold by third party sellers marketplace is great for customers because it adds unique selection and its great for sellers there are over entrepreneurs with sales of more than a year selling on amazon and theyve created over new jobs with fba that flywheel spins faster because sellers inventory becomes prime eligible prime becomes more valuable for members and sellers sell more this year we created a new program called seller fulfilled prime we invited sellers who are able to meet a high bar for shipping speed and consistency in service to be part of the prime program and ship their own orders at prime speed directly those sellers have already seen a significant bump in sales and the program has led to hundreds of thousands of additional items that are available to prime customers via free two day or next day shipping in the u s u k and germany we also created the amazon lending program to help sellers grow since the program launched weve provided aggregate funding of over billion to micro small and medium businesses across the u s u k and japan through short term loans with a total outstanding loan balance of about million stephen aarstol surfer and owner of tower paddle boards is one beneficiary his business has become one of the fastest growing companies in san diego in part with a little help from amazon lending click to cash access to capital helps these small enterprises grow benefits customers with greater selection and benefits amazon since our marketplace revenue grows along with the sellers sales we hope to expand amazon lending and are now working on ways to partner with banks so they can use their expertise to take and manage the bulk of the credit risk in addition to nourishing our big offerings we work to globalize them our marketplace creates opportunities for sellers anywhere to reach buyers around the world in the past many sellers would limit their customer base to their home country due to the practical challenges of selling internationally to globalize marketplace and expand the opportunities available to sellers we built selling tools that empowered entrepreneurs in countries to reach customers in countries last year these cross border sales are now nearly a quarter of all third party units sold on amazon to make this possible we translated hundreds of millions of product listings and provided conversion services among currencies even small and niche sellers can now tap into our global customer base and global logistics network the end result is very different from sellers handling their own one at a time cross border fulfillment plugable technologies ceo bernie thompson put it this way it really changes the paradigm when youre able to ship the goods in bulk to a warehouse in europe or japan and have those goods be fulfilled in one day or two days india is another example of how we globalize an offering like marketplace through customer obsession and a passion for invention last year we ran a program called amazon chai cart where we deployed three wheeled mobile carts to navigate in a citys business districts serve tea water and lemon juice to small business owners and teach them about selling online in a period of four months the team traveled km across cities served cups of tea and engaged with over sellers through this program and other conversations with sellers we found out there was a lot of interest in selling online but that sellers struggled with the belief that the process was time consuming tedious and complex so we invented amazon tatkal which enables small businesses to get online in less than minutes amazon tatkal is a specially designed studio on wheels offering a suite of launch services including registration imaging and cataloguing services as well as basic seller training mechanisms since its launch on february th we have reached sellers in cities were also globalizing fulfillment by amazon adapting the service to local customer needs in india we launched a program called seller flex to combine amazons logistics capabilities with sellers selection at the local neighborhood level sellers set aside a part of their warehouse for storing items to be sold on amazon and we configure it as a fulfillment center in our network that can receive and fulfill customer orders our team provides guidance on warehouse layout it and operational infrastructure and trains the seller on standard operating procedures to be followed onsite weve now launched operational seller flex sites across ten cities amazon web services just over years ago aws started in the u s with its first major service a simple storage service today aws offers more than services for compute storage databases analytics mobile internet of things and enterprise applications we also offer availability zones across geographic regions worldwide with another five regions and availability zones in canada china india the u s and the u k to be available in the coming year aws started with developers and startups and now is used by more than a million customers from organizations of every size across nearly every industry companies like pinterest airbnb ge enel capital one intuit johnson johnson philips hess adobe mcdonalds and time inc aws is bigger than amazon com was at years old growing at a faster rate and most noteworthy in my view the pace of innovation continues to accelerate we announced significant new features and services in a increase over many characterized aws as a bold and unusual bet when we started what does this have to do with selling books we could have stuck to the knitting im glad we didnt or did we maybe the knitting has as much to do with our approach as the arena aws is customer obsessed inventive and experimental long term oriented and cares deeply about operational excellence given years and many iterations that approach has allowed aws to rapidly expand into the worlds most comprehensive widely adopted cloud service as with our retail business aws is made up of many small teams with single threaded owners enabling rapid innovation the team rolls out new functionality almost daily across services and that new functionality just shows up for customers theres no upgrading many companies describe themselves as customer focused but few walk the walk most big technology companies are competitor focused they see what others are doing and then work to fast follow in contrast to of what we build in aws is driven by what customers tell us they want a good example is our new database engine amazon aurora customers have been frustrated by the proprietary nature high cost and licensing terms of traditional commercial grade database providers and while many companies have started moving toward more open engines like mysql and postgres they often struggle to get the performance they need customers asked us if we could eliminate that inconvenient trade off and thats why we built aurora it has commercial grade durability and availability is fully compatible with mysql has up to times better performance than the typical mysql implementation but is th the price of the traditional commercial grade database engines this has struck a resonant chord with customers and aurora is the fastest growing service in the history of aws nearly this same story could be told about redshift our managed data warehouse service which is the second fastest growing service in aws history both small and large companies are moving their data warehouses to redshift our approach to pricing is also driven by our customer centric culture weve dropped prices times in many cases before there was any competitive pressure to do so in addition to price reductions weve also continued to launch new lower cost services like aurora redshift quicksight our new business intelligence service ec container service our new compute container service and lambda our pioneering server less computing capability while extending our services to offer a range of highly cost effective options for running just about every type of application or it use case imaginable we even roll out and continuously improve services like trusted advisor which alerts customers when they can save money resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for our customers im pretty sure were the only it vendor telling customers how to stop spending money with us whether you are a startup founded yesterday or a business that has been around for years the cloud is providing all of us with unbelievable opportunities to reinvent our businesses add new customer experiences redeploy capital to fuel growth increase security and do all of this so much faster than before mlb advanced media is an example of an aws customer that is constantly reinventing the customer experience mlbs statcast tracking technology is a new feature for baseball fans that measures the position of each player the baserunners and the ball as they move during every play on the field giving viewers on any screen access to empirical data that answers age old questions like what could have happened if while also bringing new questions to life turning baseball into rocket science statcast uses a missile radar system to measure every pitched balls movements more than times per second streams and collects data in real time through amazon kinesis our service for processing real time streaming data stores the data on amazon s and then performs analytics in amazon ec the suite of services will generate nearly tb of raw statistical data per game and up to pb per season shedding quantitative light on age old but never verified baseball pearls of wisdom like never slide into first about seven years ago netflix announced that they were going to move all their applications to the cloud netflix chose aws because it provided them with the greatest scale and the broadest set of services and features netflix recently completed their cloud migration and stories like theirs are becoming increasingly common as companies like infor intuit and time inc have made plans to move all of their applications to aws aws is already good enough today to attract more than million customers and the service is only going to get better from here as the team continues their rapid pace of innovation well offer more and more capabilities to let builders build unfettered it will get easier and easier to collect store and analyze data well continue to add more geographic locations and well continue to see growth in mobile and connected device applications over time its likely that most companies will choose not to run their own data centers opting for the cloud instead invention machine we want to be a large company thats also an invention machine we want to combine the extraordinary customer serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement nimbleness and risk acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start ups can we do it im optimistic we have a good start on it and i think our culture puts us in a position to achieve the goal but i dont think itll be easy there are some subtle traps that even high performing large organizations can fall into as a matter of course and well have to learn as an institution how to guard against them one common pitfall for large organizations one that hurts speed and inventiveness is one size fits all decision making some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible one way doors and these decisions must be made methodically carefully slowly with great deliberation and consultation if you walk through and dont like what you see on the other side you cant get back to where you were before we can call these type decisions but most decisions arent like that they are changeable reversible theyre two way doors if youve made a suboptimal type decision you dont have to live with the consequences for that long you can reopen the door and go back through type decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups as organizations get larger there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy weight type decision making process on most decisions including many type decisions the end result of this is slowness unthoughtful risk aversion failure to experiment sufficiently and consequently diminished invention well have to figure out how to fight that tendency and one size fits all thinking will turn out to be only one of the pitfalls well work hard to avoid it and any other large organization maladies we can identify sustainability and social invention our growth has happened fast twenty years ago i was driving boxes to the post office in my chevy blazer and dreaming of a forklift in absolute numbers as opposed to percentages the past few years have been especially significant weve grown from employees in to more than now were a bit like parents who look around one day and realize their kids are grown you blink and it happens one thing thats exciting about our current scale is that we can put our inventive culture to work on moving the needle on sustainability and social issues two years ago we set a long term goal to use renewable energy across our global aws infrastructure weve since announced four significant wind and solar farms that will deliver million megawatt hours per the opposite situation is less interesting and there is undoubtedly some survivorship bias any companies that habitually use the light weight type decision making process to make type decisions go extinct before they get large year of additional renewable energy into the electric grids that supply aws data centers amazon wind farm fowler ridge has already come online we reached sustainable energy use across aws last year are on track to reach this year and are working on goals that will cover all of amazons facilities around the world including our fulfillment centers well keep expanding our efforts in areas like packaging where our culture of invention led to a big winner the frustration free packaging program seven years ago we introduced the initiative with products today there are more than globally in the program eliminated tens of millions of pounds of excess packaging material frustration free packaging is a customer delighter because the packages are easier to open its good for the planet because it creates less waste and its good for shareholders because with tighter packaging we ship less air and save on transportation costs we also continue to pioneer new programs for employees like career choice leave share and ramp back career choice pre pays of tuition for courses that teach in demand skills regardless of whether those skills are relevant to a career at amazon well pay for nursing certifications airplane mechanic courses and many others were building classrooms with glass walls right in our fulfillment centers as a way to encourage employees to participate in the program and to make it easy we see the impact through stories like sharie warmack a single mother of eight who worked in one of our phoenix fulfillment centers career choice paid for sharie to get licensed to drive an wheeler sharie worked hard passed her tests and shes now a long haul driver for schneider trucking and loving it this coming year were launching a program to teach other interested companies the benefits of career choice and how to implement it leave share and ramp back are programs that give new parents flexibility with their growing families leave share lets employees share their amazon paid leave with their spouse or domestic partner if their spouses employer doesnt offer paid leave ramp back gives birth mothers additional control over the pace at which they return to work just as with our health care plan these benefits are egalitarian theyre the same for our fulfillment center and customer service employees as they are for our most senior executives renewable energy frustration free packaging career choice leave share and ramp back are examples of a culture that embraces invention and long term thinking its very energizing to think that our scale provides opportunities to create impact in these areas i can tell you its a great joy for me to get to work every day with a team of such smart imaginative and passionate people on behalf of all of us at amazon thank you for your support as shareholders as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement
