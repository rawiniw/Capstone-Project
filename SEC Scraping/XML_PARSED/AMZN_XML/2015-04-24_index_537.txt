enhance shareholder value proxy access for shareholdersproposal end of shareholder proposal and statement of support by mr mcritchie recommendation of the board of directors on item over the past six years the board has monitored and will continue to monitor developments on proxy access in addition the company will continue to discuss proxy access developments with its shareholders as part of its regular shareholder engagement program over the coming year however at this time the board of directors believes that this proposal is not in the best interests of amazon coms shareholders and recommends that you vote against this proposal for the following reasons the nominating and corporate governance committee maintains an active board refreshment program to nominate independent directors who are responsive to shareholders interests are free of conflicts with our competitors and possess the right industry and leadership skills needed to represent all shareholders and guide our companys continued success the company has adopted numerous corporate governance practices to reinforce the boards accountability to shareholders the board views the specific terms of this proposal as problematic and out of line with evolving proxy access standards and while the board has monitored and will continue to study proxy access developments proxy access remains rare among the companies with which the company competes for board talent and has never actually been used and the board believes the most immediate effect of adopting proxy access would be to discourage qualified individuals from agreeing to serve on the companys board the nominating and corporate governance committee maintains an active board refreshment program the board actively reviews and refreshes its membership over the last seven years the board has had an average of eight independent directors and added five new directors and had three directors depart the fully independent nominating and corporate governance committee annually evaluates both the board and each individual director and in making decisions on the boards composition considers the tenure performance contributions experience skill set and commitment of each director in addition our directors annually evaluate both their own and one anothers performance through formal board committee and individual director evaluation processes we discuss under director nominations on page the process that the nominating and corporate governance committee goes through in assessing the qualifications and skills of a candidate for the board these include a commitment to representing the long term interests of the shareholders customer experience skills internet savvy leadership ability personal and professional ethics and business and professional experience in fields such as operations technology finance accounting product development intellectual property law multimedia entertainment and marketing other considerations that affect the nominating and corporate governance committees selection of director candidates are the absence of conflicts through associations with significant suppliers or with the wide range of companies against which we compete as a result of these processes new directors have been added to the board as the companys operations have evolved and diversified while we have also retained directors with deep understanding of the companys background rapid growth and past successes by evaluating all of these factors the nominating and corporate governance committee has developed a board of directors comprising highly successful innovative and independent directors who effectively oversee amazons management and operations and have guided our company to the long term success and benefit of our shareholdersover the long term amazon com has consistently outperformed the nasdaq composite producing higher returns in the past three five and ten year periods additionally year to date amazon com is substantially outperforming the nasdaq our existing corporate governance practices reinforce the boards alignment with and accountability to shareholders in determining to recommend that you vote against this proxy access proposal the board also took into account the following corporate governance policies at the company that already serve to promote responsiveness to shareholders all directors are elected annually in uncontested meetings directors are elected only if they receive a majority of the votes cast and are subject to our resignation policy under existing sec rules and state law shareholders already have the power to directly nominate and solicit proxies for their own director candidates at shareholder meetings without having to navigate any additional ownership thresholds or satisfy multi year holding period requirements see page the independent directors elect an independent lead director for a two year term our directors annually evaluate both their own and one anothers performance through formal board committee and individual director evaluation processes to enhance their alignment with the interests of our long term shareholders our independent directors compensation consists solely of periodic stock unit awards that vest over a three year period and targets the th percentile of director compensation of peer group companies our executive officers are compensated primarily through stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time and our chief executive officer receives minimal annual compensation and no equity compensation in light of his substantial ownership in amazon com shareholders may call special meetings at which they can nominate director candidates or propose other business shareholders may submit names of potential director candidates directly to the board for consideration see page and in addition to our annual shareholder engagement process shareholders are able to communicate with the board in the manner described in our guidelines on significant corporate governance issues because we maintain an open director nomination process accessible to all shareholders as described above and historically our shareholders have consistently supported our directors nominated by our board and not advanced opposing candidates we do not believe that proxy access as an additional director nomination mechanism is warranted in addition to these governance practices which promote responsiveness to shareholder concerns the board has a strong record of being active and engaged and building long term shareholder value the board is fully open to considering shareholder views and potential nominees and the company regularly solicits the views of its major shareholders on governance matters including proxy access and will continue to do so the companys shareholders already have an effective voice in director selection election and accountability and have consistently and overwhelmingly elected our director nominees the specific terms of this proposal are problematic the process advocated in the proposal represents a significant break from the traditional director election process under which director candidates nominated by existing directors who hold fiduciary responsibilities to all shareholders are included in the companys proxy materials proxy contests of the type requested by the proposal would be highly disruptive and could deter qualified individuals from board service as a result in addition to believing that proxy access generally is designed to address problems that do not exist at our company the board believes that this proposal is problematic because it contains prescriptive mandates that are out of line with evolving proxy access standards and lacks many of the protective provisions that were addressed in the secs proxy access rule rule a for example the proposal does not provide assurances that proxy access will not be subject to abuse by investors seeking to take control of the board although shareholders seeking to use the secs rule a would have been required to certify that they were not holding any of a companys securities with the purpose or with the effect of changing control of the registrant that rule was struck down and this proposal instead requires that proxy access be made available to the fullest extent allowed by law thus this proposal differs significantly from other proxy access shareholder proposals that specifically require nominating shareholders to certify that they are not seeking to effect a change in control of the company proxy access is intended to give shareholders an opportunity to have their nominees for election included in the companys proxy materials it should not be a mechanism for effecting a change in control of the company unlike the secs rule a the proposal requires the company to list all nominees alphabetically by nameso the companys presentation in its proxy materials of nominees selected by the board through the exercise of their fiduciary duties would be interspersed with nominees who may have a specific agenda on behalf of one or a few shareholders thereby adding needless confusion for shareholders regarding the distinction between nominees the proposal is phrased as a nomination process and would require the company to include any qualifying shareholders nominees in the companys proxy statement regardless of whether the shareholders intend to file their own proxy statement and run a proxy contest in contrast rule a required a shareholder to elect to utilize the proxy access process and did not require a company to include the shareholders nominees in the companys proxy statement if the shareholders otherwise were soliciting proxies for election of their nominees the proposal does not require shareholder nominees to be independent or to satisfy applicable law and in particular fails to require that shareholder nominees have no affiliations with a competitor rule a provided that proxy access should be limited to nominees that meet objective independence standards and satisfy all applicable legal requirements the burden of engaging in a proxy contest against a director candidate who if elected could cause the company to be out of compliance with applicable independence requirements and to violate the law could ultimately harm shareholders the proposal does not require nominating shareholders to have held and retain voting and investment power of the shares used to establish eligibility to nominate a director under the proposal a shareholder could have a net short position in the companys stock and still be entitled to make a nomination rule a provided that proxy access would only be available to shareholders that possessed ultimate ownership rights over the shares the proposal does not require nominating shareholders to retain ownership of their shares through the meeting dateso a nominating shareholder could sell all of its shares prior to the meeting date which would misalign the interests of the nominating shareholder and company shareholders rule a required a nominating shareholder to hold the shares through the meeting date in addition the proposal does not cap the number of shareholders comprising a group for purposes of the threshold which could allow hundreds of special interest shareholders to act together and administratively burden the company and also does not require the nominating shareholders to assume liability stemming from any legal or regulatory violation arising out of their nomination of director candidates or their statements in support of their director candidates the board believes that the failure of the proposal to provide the foregoing protections against abuse of the proxy access process makes the proposal out of line with evolving proxy access standards and could result in proxy access nominations being abused or threatened in a manner that would be harmful to our shareholders implementation of proxy access on these terms also could increase pressure on the board and management to take a short term perspective to company strategies initiatives and operations that would not be in the long term interests of our shareholders proxy access is rare and could discourage qualified individuals from agreeing to serve on the companys board the board believes that any decision to implement proxy access should be made in a careful and deliberative manner only after demonstrating that it will enhance shareholder value among companies with which amazon com competes for director talent proxy access remains a rarity moreover many of the companies that have implemented proxy access to date have been companies with governance or operational failures consistent with that focus a recent initiative by one large institutional investor to promote adoption of proxy access has been directed at companies where there is a lack of board diversity or other governance or operational concerns given the absence of these types of concerns at the company the companys strong corporate governance practices engagement with shareholders and track record of building significant long term value the board believes that with respect to the company proxy access is not necessary even among those few public companies that provide for proxy access to date no director candidate has ever been nominated by shareholders pursuant to a proxy access process thus the board believes that proxy access is neither appropriate nor needed at the company the nominating and corporate governance committee which spends a significant amount of time searching for and evaluating director candidates believes that the most immediate impact of adopting proxy access would be to discourage talented and innovative leaders from agreeing to serve on the board the board recognizes that the ability to elect directors is one of shareholders most fundamental rights the companys existing corporate governance practices empower and protect that right the board intends to continue to monitor developments on proxy access and the company will discuss proxy access developments with its shareholders as part of its regular shareholder engagement program over the coming year at the present time though in light of the corporate governance practices and the concerns over proxy access and this proposal that are addressed above the board believes that adoption of this proposal is not in the best interests of our long term shareholders the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding proxy access item shareholder proposal regarding a report concerning corporate political contributions investor voice spc th ave nw seattle washington acting on behalf of bryce mathern a shareholder who as of december owned shares of common stock of the company has notified us of its intention to propose the following resolution at the annual meeting the board recommends a

communications on behalf of federal state or local candidates amazon offers a brief political spending statement on its website which indicates that it did not make direct contributions to political candidates and groups in it also discloses the total amount s paid to trade associations and coalitions however this is significantly lacking because the statement does not include payments to trade associations and amounts used for non deductible purposes or to other tax exempt groups such as c so called social welfare organizations that engage in political activities the company also does not pledge to itemize its direct political contributions if any in the future because of these discrepancies amazon ranked near the bottom of the cpa zicklin index of corporate accountability and disclosure which ranks the top companies in the sp because a survey of publicly available data cannot provide a complete picture of any companys politically motivated activity this proposal asks amazon to disclose the entirety of its political spendingincluding payments to trade associations and other tax exempt organizations that are used for political purposes doing so would bring amazon in line with a growing number of peerswhich includes ebay intel and microsoftthat both support accountability around political disclosure and present this information on their public websites the companys board and its shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to be able to fully evaluate the risks associated with the political use of corporate assets therefore we urge a vote for this

investment power executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the companys letter to shareholders we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as a result we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies for example under our compensation philosophy we have prioritized stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time in addition we believe granting stock based compensation to employees at all levels across the company results in motivated customer centric people who think and act like owners because they are owners our compensation philosophy for our named executive officers identified in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our employees and is governed by the following principles first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests third our compensation program emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as a basis for compensation increases as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values including customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like owners and thinking long term a high hiring bar and frugality for our named executive officers who are employed on an at will basis we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or change in control benefits for our executive officers except as noted below we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to performance criteria which could cause employees to focus solely on short term returns at the expense of long term growth and innovation base salaries consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for mr piacentini due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon com mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year for example because annual total compensation includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that year without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years a named executive officers total compensation will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon com since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of six years vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a change in control unless the acquiring company does not assume the awards for new hire grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon com the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance including our core values and expected contributions to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price appreciation assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in april messrs szkutak jassy piacentini and wilke received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment mr szkutak received a restricted stock unit award for shares in september after the leadership development and compensation committee had made this grant mr szkutak announced his decision to retire effective in june because mr szkutaks restricted stock unit award does not begin to vest until may the award will terminate prior to any of the shares vesting mr jassy received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr jassys experience and skill in managing web services and cloud computing operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr piacentini received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr piacentinis experience and skill in managing our international consumer
