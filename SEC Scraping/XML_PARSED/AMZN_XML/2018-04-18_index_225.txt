certain of the shareholder proposals relate to environmental sustainability social or governance issues often requesting that we prepare a report adopt a policy or take some other narrowly or vaguely defined action we typically focus on initiatives and activities that can have the greatest impact given the specific nature of our operations such as our wind and solar farms to generate electricity and our frustration free packaging initiatives but we also have innumerable large and small initiatives underway at any point in time as we seek to constantly invent across the company for these reasons we generally oppose proposals requesting specific reports policies or initiatives for not being the most efficient use of our time and resources or not reflecting the unique and evolving nature of our operations instead we encourage you to learn more about the many ways we are addressing such matters by exploring the information provided through about amazon on our website at www

proposal regarding a policy to require an independent board chair beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support resolved shareholders of amazon com inc amazon ask the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent director the policy should provide that i if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the policy within days of that determination and ii compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair this policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation supporting statement amazons chief executive officer ceo jeff bezos also serves as board chairman we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporations governance which can harm shareholder value as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and support strong board oversight proxy advisor glass lewis opined in a report that shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a ceo or other executive also serves as

leadership would we think more likely result in improved policies and practices to mitigate these business risks we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal as discussed above under corporate governance the board is responsible for the control and direction of the company and has selected our founder and ceo jeff bezos as the chair of the board the board believes that mr bezos role in founding amazon and his significant ownership stake in the company positions him well to work with the board on the key policy and operational issues that will help the company operate in the long term interests of shareholders in this regard amazons stock has significantly outperformed the sp over the last and year periods for example over the last five years amazons stock has increased approximately while the sp has risen approximately in addition the independent directors on the board have appointed a lead director from the boards independent directors currently jonathan j rubinstein former co ceo of bridgewater associates in order to promote independent leadership of the board the lead director presides over the executive sessions of the independent directors chairs board meetings in the chairs absence and provides direction on agendas schedules information and materials for board meetings that will be most helpful to the independent directors in addition the lead director confers from time to time with the chair of the board and the independent directors and reviews as appropriate the annual schedule of regular board meetings and major board meeting agenda topics the guidance and direction provided by the lead director reinforce the boards independent oversight of management and contribute to communication among members of the board the board believes that this leadership structure improves the boards ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps the company operate in the long term interests of shareholders while maintaining a strong independent perspective moreover the board believes flexibility in board leadership structure is more suitable for the company than a rigid and prescriptive approach our directors have a fiduciary duty to routinely evaluate and determine the most appropriate leadership structure for the company and its shareholders in light of the companys specific characteristics or circumstances at any given time accordingly our governing documents provide the board with the flexibility to determine the optimal leadership structure for the company including when appropriate separating the positions of chair of the board and ceo the board believes that the company and its shareholders benefit from this flexibility and that the directors are best positioned to lead this evaluation given their knowledge of the companys leadership team strategic goals opportunities and challenges we believe that it is important for the board to continue to determine on a case by case basis the most effective leadership structure for the company rather than take a rigid approach to board leadership as called for by the shareholder proposal in addition in reviewing this proposal the board took into consideration relevant benchmarking data and concluded that the proposals rigid approach is not common practice according to the spencer stuart u s board index only of sp companies reported having a formal policy requiring the separation of the ceo and chair roles while the overwhelming majority of companies have a structure that provides the board flexibility in determining the appropriate leadership structure moreover as of of sp companies combined the chairman and ceo roles according to the spencer stuart u s board index in addition our existing corporate governance practices reinforce the boards alignment with and accountability to shareholders our current practices include annual election of directors proxy access an annual director evaluation process a shareholder right to call special meetings at which they can nominate director candidates or propose other business a shareholder right to submit names of director candidates directly to the board for consideration and a shareholder right to communicate directly with the board in the manner described in our guidelines on significant corporate governance issues for the foregoing reasons the board believes adoption of a policy to require the chair of the board to be an independent director would not enhance shareholder value as such the board believes that the policy requested by this proposal is not appropriate for the company and not in the best interests of shareholders the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding a policy to require an independent board chair item shareholder proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support resolved shareholders ask the board of amazon com inc amazon to take or initiate steps to amend company governing documents to provide that all non binding matters presented by shareholders shall be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast for and against an item this policy would apply to all such matters unless shareholders have approved higher thresholds or applicable laws or stock exchange regulations dictate otherwise supporting statement this proposal seeks greater transparency clarity and understanding around how informed stockholders vote on shareholder proposals in voting the meaning of abstain is defined by the oxford english dictionary as to formally decline to vote either for or against a proposal or motion a simple majority formula therefore includes votes cast for and against but not abstentions it provides the most democratic clear and accurate picture of the intent of shareowners who are both informed and decided while not including in the formula the votes of abstaining voters who have declined to express an opinion when abstaining voters choose to mark abstain it is apparent that they intend to vote neither for nor against an item yet amazon unilaterally counts abstain votes as if against every shareholder sponsored proposal it is unreasonable for amazon to assert it knows the will of undecided voters and to artificially construe abstentions in favor of management companies have a choice whether or not to count abstentions the voting formula amazon uses is not mandated research demonstrates that counting abstentions systematically disadvantages shareholders http bit ly voting research corporate secretary it does this by depressing the appearance of support for shareholder concerns the math is simple when abstaining shareholders are instead treated as if they voted against a proposal management benefits because the tally is lowered subverting vote outcomes counting abstentions has allowed companies to describe true majority votes as instead having failed distorting communication annual meeting votes offer the only opportunity for most shareholders to communicate with boards counting abstentions as if against shareholder proposals management changes how outcomes are reported and how the public perceives support for shareholder concerns we observe that amazons director election where management benefits from the appearance of strong support does not count abstentions this means that management items and shareholder items do not receive equal treatment though we call on the company to count shareholder items as they do the director election the council of institutional investors cii has declared abstentions should be counted only for purposes of a quorum emphasis added therefore support accuracy fairness and good governance at amazon by voting for simple majority vote counting on shareholder sponsored proposals end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board of directors recommends that you vote against this proposal the board regularly reviews the companys corporate governance practices including the methodologies for how votes are cast the board has undertaken several steps to improve the companys governance practices including adopting proxy access and majority voting for directors the board does not however believe that the actions requested by the proposal represent a necessary change to the companys governance practices our vote counting practices are consistent with delaware law the companys vote counting methodology is consistent with delaware law which applies to the company by virtue of its incorporation in that state section of the delaware general corporation law provides as a default that in all matters other than the election of directors the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders because shares that vote to abstain are present and entitled to vote under this delaware law standard any shares present at the meeting that abstain from voting are essentially counted as votes against the matter our vote counting practices are fair and consistent with practices of peer companies the vote counting methodology used by the company does not inherently favor proposals submitted by the board over proposals submitted by shareholders as the vote counting standard for approving any proposal other than for the election of directors is identical thus the company applies the same vote counting standard to its own advisory votes on executive compensation for example as it does to a shareholder proposal in addition the vote counting methodology used by the company is the standard applied by a majority of our peers incorporated in delaware and according to a study by gmi ratings by a majority of sp companies changing our vote counting practices would not be in the best interests of the company all shares present in person or represented by proxy at our annual meeting are entitled to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement the board believes that it is the responsibility of any person putting a proposal forward for shareholders to approveregardless of whether the company or a shareholder proponentto persuade shareholders owning a majority of the shares that vote to support the proposal abstentions reflect the fact that a shareholder has reviewed and evaluated a proposal but has not been persuaded to support the proposal further shareholders are clearly told the effect of an abstaining vote as opposed to ignoring shareholders who abstain as the proposal would do we believe it appropriate to count abstentions as present at the annual meeting and entitled to vote and thus as relevant in determining whether a majority of the shares present have voted in favor of a proposal the effect of changing the companys vote counting methodology to completely remove abstentions from the results of a vote would be to disenfranchise those voters who chose to abstain from voting it would remove one of the voters three options as a vote to abstain itself is a position taken by a shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the board changing our vote counting practices is not necessary changing the manner in which abstentions are counted in shareholder votes would not have been determinative in any of the proposals voted on by the companys shareholders since the company went public in over that time if the proponents proposed vote counting methodology had been used it would never have increased the voting results for a proposal by more than and would never have resulted in a different outcome in terms of whether a proposal passed or failed to pass in our annual meeting of shareholders this vote counting proposal failed with approximately of the shares present at the meeting declining to vote for such proposal use of the proponents proposed vote counting methodology would not have changed such outcome the companys vote counting methodology is both consistent with delaware law and fair to shareholders the board believes that it is important to recognize the voices of all shareholders including those who choose to abstain from voting on a particular proposal therefore the board does not believe that changing the companys vote counting methodology is in the best interests of the company the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals beneficial ownership of shares

beneficial ownership of such shares includes shares beneficially owned by other executive officers not individually listed in the table executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis compensation philosophy as stated in the companys letter to shareholders we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as a result we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies for example under our compensation philosophy we have prioritized stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time in addition we believe granting stock based compensation to employees at all levels across the company results in motivated customer centric people who think and act like owners because they are owners our compensation philosophy for our named executive officers identified in the summary compensation table below is the same as for all of our employees and is governed by the following principles first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests third our compensation program emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as a basis for compensation increases as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values including customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like owners and thinking long term a high hiring bar and frugality for our named executive officers who are employed on an at will basis we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or change in control benefits for our executive officers additionally except as noted below in certain circumstances we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to performance criteria which could cause employees to focus solely on short term returns at the expense of long term growth and innovation we believe that investing in the creation of long term value without the use of performance measures or specific indices is optimal for amazon employees particularly at the executive level and for shareholders we believe that the best measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term to help align our employees with long term value creation we compensate our employees with restricted stock unit awards that have long vesting periods over time employees will have multiple restricted stock unit awards that vest over many years and thus provide a greater amount of potential compensation in later years than the current year this encourages employees including executives to seek out develop and pursue initiatives that focus on serving our customers and reflect a long term view for thinking about our operations holistically and contributing to initiatives across the company as a company that relentlessly pursues invention across a wide range of opportunities we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize a few discrete or short term financial or operational performance measures that may narrowly focus our executives on the success of only isolated initiatives instead of on the long term success of the company as a whole for example in we could have adopted performance measures appropriate for an internet bookseller but those performance measures may have discouraged our employees from investing their time and energy into initiatives that later became aws kindle and alexa other examples of long term focus include the development of our third party seller business which was aided by the lessons learned from our unsuccessful efforts to build an auctions marketplace and when we experimented with adding services other than fast shipping to our prime membership program a performance goal assumes some level of success by a prescribed measure but to have a culture that relentlessly pursues invention we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition means we do not know in advance whether it will work in addition given the unique nature of amazon and our many initiatives standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to serve as relevant comparisons for benchmarking performance for example if we had tied compensation to our performance relative to a retail index we might never have pursued our aws business since executives would have been penalized for making the early investments in cloud technology and infrastructure that aws required similarly if we tied compensation to our performance relative to a technology index we might not have built our own devices developed our own movies and tv shows or innovated shipping and delivery methods a customized index locks in a business profile at a point in time and may deter employees from considering or pursuing initiatives that do not fit into that mold thus we think the best stock market comparison we can make is measuring our own success can we continue to grow our share value over the long term as a result we believe the best performance measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term therefore when we set our executives target compensation we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price so that our executives compensation will be negatively impacted if our stock price is flat or declines and is favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial stock price assumption this approach has served our employees and shareholders well over the past three years as our stock price has increased approximately between january and december base salaries consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for messrs blackburn jassy and wilke due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon mr bezos again requested not to receive additional compensation in and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year for example because annual total compensation as reported in the summary compensation table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that year without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years a named executive officers total compensation as reported will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the senior vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of five or six years vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a change in control unless the leadership development and compensation committee determines that the acquiring company will not be assuming or substituting the awards for new hire grants and grants made in connection with internal promotions the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance including our core values and expected contributions to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price appreciation assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in the named executive officers did not receive any new equity awards in evaluating the compensation of our named executive officers in the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet technology and media companies including alphabet apple att best buy cisco ebay facebook general electric honeywell ibm intel microsoft oracle starbucks target wal mart and the walt disney company the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data the total number of restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers during the three year period from to represented only i of the total number of restricted stock units granted to all employees during the same three year period and ii of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the same three year period we impose additional vesting conditions on certain stock based awards issued to named executive officers for equity awards granted prior to recent tax law changes these conditions were intended to qualify the stock based awards as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code however there is no guarantee that these awards will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service as a result of changes to the tax laws we expect that equity awards granted or other compensation provided under arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november generally will not be deductible to the extent they result in compensation to certain of our named executive officers for or after that exceeds million in any one year for any such officer new hire cash bonuses none of the named executive officers received a new hire cash bonus in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees at times we may provide security for mr bezos and certain other executive officers including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of executive officers security expenses reportable security expenses are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers shareholder advisory vote to approve executive compensation at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers with more than of the votes cast for approval of our executive compensation on an advisory basis the leadership development and compensation committee evaluated the results of the advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as well as discussions we have had in recent years with our shareholders and the other factors discussed in this compensation discussion and analysis when evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices while each of these factors informed the leadership development and compensation committees decisions regarding our executive compensation program the leadership
