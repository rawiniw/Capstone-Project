committee will consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program the board of directors recommends a vote for approval on an advisory basis of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement shareholder proposals items through are shareholder proposals that will be voted on at the annual meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent some of these proposals contain assertions that we believe are incorrect and we have not attempted to refute all of the inaccuracies certain of the shareholder proposals relate to environmental sustainability social or governance issues often requesting that we prepare a report adopt a policy or take some other particular action in some cases we already support some of the initiatives or concerns addressed in such proposals and may already have taken actions that we believe address the underlying concerns of a proposal but we may disagree with how the proposal seeks to prescribe the manner in which we address the issue we typically focus on initiatives and activities that can have the greatest impact given the specific nature of our operations such as our wind and solar farms to generate electricity and our frustration free packaging initiatives but we also have innumerable large and small initiatives underway at any point in time as we seek to constantly invent across the company for these reasons we generally oppose proposals requesting specific reports policies or initiatives for not reflecting the unique and evolving nature of our operations instead we encourage you to read more about the many ways we are addressing these issues through our about amazon website at www aboutamazon com our sustainability website at www amazon com sustainability our amazon sustainability question bank at www amazon com qb our diversity website at www amazon com diversity and our amazon day one blog at blog aboutamazon com we will promptly

avenue north seattle washington item shareholder proposal requesting an annual report on managementof food waste beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support resolved shareholders request that amazon com inc issue an annual report at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information on the environmental and social impacts of food waste generated from the companys operations given the significant impact that food waste has on societal risk from climate change and hunger supporting statement shareholders leave the method of disclosure to managements discretion shareholders also defer to management on the specific approaches used to mitigate food waste and which parts of amazons operations are best to target some options we recommend as guidelines include conducting evaluations to determine the causes quantities and destinations of food waste estimating greenhouse gas ghg emissions reductions that could be achieved or amounts of food redistributed to the food insecure if the company reduced the generation of food waste assessing the feasibility of setting goals to reduce food waste and progress made towards meeting these targets whereas despite one in seven u s households struggling to afford regular healthy meals percent of all food produced in the u s is wasted generating devastating social and environmental consequences decomposing food in landfills generates percent of u s methane emissions exacerbating climate change wasted food production is responsible for consuming percent of u s freshwater percent of fertilizer and percent of cropland project drawdown cited food waste reduction as the third most impactful tactic in reducing global ghg emissions according to the u n food and agriculture organization ending food waste would preserve enough food to feed billion peoplemore than twice the number of undernourished people in the world industry peers such as hello fresh kroger walmart wegmans ahold usa and weis markets disclose or have committed to quantitative disclosure of food waste levels set targets for food waste reduction and publish information on progress towards these goals unfortunately amazon has yet to report any company wide food waste management strategy including context metrics and quantitative improvement goals action to reduce food waste is even more imperative for online grocery retailers because they may be more susceptible to high rates of food waste given complex distribution systems and the inability to rely on solutions employed by conventional retailers amazon has captured of u s online grocery spending outpacing its peers amazon invested heavily in its amazon fresh and amazon direct online grocery services and spent billion to acquire whole foods thereby increasing the companys exposure to products with greater rates of food waste and spoilage the sustainability accounting standards board cites food waste management as material to food distributors operating performance recommending disclosure of the aggregate amount of food waste generated and the percentage diverted from landfills strengthened disclosure of food waste reduction efforts could help amazon meet its social and environmental goals combat climate change and hunger and bolster its brand reputation in a rapidly changing market end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board recognizes the importance of good corporate citizenship and is committed to sustainability and social responsibility including the reduction of food waste and limiting the environmental and social impacts of food waste amazon is actively involved in making business decisions and implementing a number of grocery inventory management approaches that address food waste by minimizing the amount of food going to landfills mirroring the u s environmental protection agencys food recovery hierarchy and putting excess food to better use for example whole foods market maintains strong partnerships with food donation programs such as the food donation connection which reduces food waste by distributing unsold food to local food kitchens and shelters similarly in we launched a nationwide initiative to donate excess food to feeding america a non profit organization whose mission is to feed americas hungry through a nationwide network of member food banks through feeding america amazons u s fulfillment centers have donated millions of pounds of food to help those in need we also have implemented food waste strategies based on the u s environmental protection agencys food recovery hierarchy the same guidelines cited by the proposal all whole foods market stores participate in a variety of food waste diversion and recycling programs such as composting anaerobic digestion to create renewable energy and animal feed programs and whole foods market team members are trained on food waste efficiency from smart ordering to food donation in addition whole foods market is continually assessing emerging technologies and new opportunities to further increase its landfill diversion and recycling rates our initiatives to address food waste supplement and support the many other sustainability initiatives we have in place our sustainability website available at https www aboutamazon com sustainability provides information on our sustainability and social responsibility efforts including waste minimization for our operations in light of our track record and demonstrated commitment to lessening the impact of our business operations on the environment including the management of food waste the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting an annual report on management of food waste item shareholder proposal requesting a reduction in the ownership threshold for calling special shareholder meetings beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support special shareholder meetings resolved the shareholders of amazon com inc amazon or company hereby request the board of directors take the steps necessary to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders with an aggregate of net long of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting this proposal does not impact our boards current power to call a special meeting supporting statement amazon allows only shareholders with at least of company shares to call a special meeting whereas delaware law allows of company shares to call a special meeting a meaningful shareholder right to call a special meeting is a way to bring an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle this is important because there could be months between annual meetings see https www aboutamazon com sustainability circular economy amazon food donations currently of sp companies have adopted company bylaws articles of incorporation or charter provisions to allow shareholders to call a special meeting more than half of all sp companies allow shareholders this right in the topic of providing shareholders a right to call a special meeting or to reduce the threshold to call such meetings won at netflix lincoln national omnicom group cummins and sprint aerosystems holdings as well as at nuance communications large funds such as vanguard tiaa cref blackrock and ssga funds management inc state street support the right of shareholders to call special meetings it may be possible to adopt this proposal by simply incorporating this text into our governing documents special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes unless otherwise prescribed by statute may be called by the chairman of the board or the president and shall be called by the chairman of the board or president or secretary upon the order in writing of a majority of or by resolution of the board of directors or at the request in writing of stockholders owning net long of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote we urge the board to join the mainstream of major u s companies and establish a right for shareholders owning of our outstanding common sock sic to call a special meeting please vote for special shareowner meetingsproposal end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board believes that a lower ownership standard for calling special shareholder meetings could disrupt the boards and our ability to focus on the long term benefit of shareholders which has been so successful to date as a company that relentlessly pursues invention across a wide range of opportunities we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition means we do not know in advance what will work and we may sometimes have short term setbacks instead of focusing on short term financial or operational performance measures we pursue the long term success of amazon as a whole for example if we had overly focused on short term results we may have avoided investing time and energy into initiatives that later became aws kindle and alexa while the board agrees that it is important for shareholders to have the ability to call special shareholder meetings too low of a threshold could expose shareholders to the risk of special meetings being called by a few shareholders focused on narrow or short term interests rather than the long term best interests of the company and shareholders generally for example event driven hedge funds could use special meetings to disrupt our business plans or to facilitate self serving short term financial strategies even if they are ultimately not able to obtain support from a majority of shares those who might seek to call a special shareholders meeting could subject us to considerable expense distract management and the board from important business initiatives or seek self interested concessions in exchange for avoiding a special meeting perhaps this is the reason why as of april a majority of the fortune companies surveyed by sharkrepellent net that allow shareholders to call special shareholder meetings have set a threshold higher than that requested by the proponent by setting the ownership threshold for calling a special meeting at we are better able to ensure that a special meeting is called only when supported by a broad cross section of our shareholders shareholders that do plan to hold our shares for the long term are able to present proposals at annual meetings and suggest director nominees to the nominating and corporate governance committee in addition our bylaws provide a proxy access right pursuant to which a shareholder or group of up to shareholders who have held at least of our shares for at least years may include director nominees representing up to of the number of directors in office in our proxy materials for annual meetings of our shareholders in light of these existing shareholder rights the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting a reduction in the ownership threshold for calling special shareholder meetings item shareholder proposal requesting a ban on government use of certain technologies beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support risks of sales of facial recognition software whereas shareholders are concerned amazons facial recognition technology rekognition poses risk to civil and human rights and shareholder value civil liberties organizations academics and shareholders have demanded amazon halt sales of rekognition to government concerned that our company is enabling a surveillance system readily available to violate rights and target communities of color four hundred fifty amazon employees echoed this demand posing a talent and retention risk brian brackeen former chief executive officer of facial recognition company kairos said any company in this space that willingly hands facial recognition software over to a government be it america or another nations is willfully endangering peoples lives in florida and oregon police have piloted rekognition amazon web services already provides cloud computing services to immigration and customs enforcement ice and is reportedly marketing rekognition to ice despite concerns rekognition could facilitate immigrant surveillance and racial profiling rekognition contradicts amazons opposition to facilitating surveillance in amazon supported a lawsuit against government gag orders stating the fear of secret surveillance could limit the adoption and use of cloud services users should not be put to a choice between reaping the benefits of technological innovation and maintaining the privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution shareholders have little evidence our company is effectively restricting the use of rekognition to protect privacy and civil rights in july a reporter asked amazon executive teresa carlson whether amazon has drawn any red lines any standards guidelines on what you will and you will not do in terms of defense work carlson responded we have not drawn any lines there we are unwaveringly in support of our law enforcement defense and intelligence community in july lawmakers asked the government accountability office to study whether commercial entities selling facial recognition adequately audit use of their technology to ensure that use is not unlawful inconsistent with terms of service or otherwise raise privacy civil rights and civil liberties concerns microsoft has called for government regulation of facial recognition technology saying if we move too fast we may find that peoples fundamental rights are being broken resolved shareholders request that the board of directors prohibit sales of facial recognition technology to government agencies unless the board concludes after an evaluation using independent evidence that the technology does not cause or contribute to actual or potential violations of civil and human rights supporting statement proponents recommend the board consult with technology and civil liberties experts and civil and human rights advocates to assess the extent to which such technology may endanger or violate privacy or civil rights and disproportionately impact people of color immigrants and activists and how amazon would mitigate these risks the extent to which such technologies may be marketed and sold to repressive governments identified by the united states department of state country reports on human rights practices end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item on february amazon published a blog post detailing our proposed guidelines on the responsible use of facial recognition technology https aws amazon com blogs machine learning some thoughts on facial recognition legislation in the blog post we stated that we recognize the concerns that have been raised about how facial recognition could be used to discriminate and violate civil rights and that weve talked to customers researchers academics policymakers and others to understand how to best balance the benefits of facial recognition with the potential risks facial recognition technology significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to identify people or objects in photos and video this makes it a powerful tool for business purposes but just as importantly for law enforcement and government agencies to catch criminals prevent crime and find missing people new technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse instead there should be open honest and earnest dialogue among all parties involved to ensure that the technology is applied appropriately and is continuously enhanced amazon rekognition is a cloud based application available to amazon web services aws customers that analyzes images or videos provided to the application amazon rekognitions technology can be used to help identify objects people text scenes and activities as well as to detect any inappropriate content customers provide images and video they want to have analyzed and amazon rekognition returns an output including a confidence score indicating how accurate the service believes the output to be customers then use the output for their own use cases since being introduced in amazon rekognition has been used to aid non profit advocacy and government groups to rescue victims of human trafficking inhibit child exploitation and reunite missing children with their families it has also been applied extensively for various commercial uses such as to identify public figures who are speaking at large events or live on air authenticate attendees at live events to shorten lines build educational apps for children enhance security through multi factor authentication prevent package theft search through large volumes of media assets and identify for removal third party generated website content for suggestive or explicit content among numerous other examples amazon rekognition is not a program that can be downloaded and stored on the customers own systems it is instead an application that an aws customer can pay to access and generate results on an ongoing basis via the cloud and is hosted on and run through awss servers to gain access a user must open an account and accept the aws terms of use in doing so customers agree to use the service offerings within the boundaries of acceptable use as expressly defined in the terms of a customer contract with aws which includes the aws acceptable use policy available at https aws amazon com aup under the aws acceptable use policy customers may not use awss services for any illegal harmful fraudulent infringing or offensive use including a ny activities that are illegal that violate the rights of others or that may be harmful to others our operations or reputation this includes the violation of any laws related to privacy discrimination and civil rights aws further states that it may investigate any violation of the acceptable use policy or misuse of the aws site or its services which could lead to action including removing disabling access to or modifying any violative content or resources and reporting potentially illegal activities to law enforcement regulators and other appropriate third parties aws provides a website and email address where any person can provide reports of suspected abuse and aws employs trained staff that act on every report that is received aws dedicates significant resources to testing auditing and improving its technology to improve accuracy including ensuring diverse perspectives on development teams using training data sets that reflect gender racial ethnic religious and cultural diversity incorporating feedback from third parties and educating customers on best practices such as appropriate use of confidence levels customers can select their own confidence levels based on their specific use case aws provides customers with guidance on the appropriate use of generated output and selection of confidence levels including a recommendation to set confidence levels at a high threshold in situations where high accuracy is important in internal accuracy tests of amazon rekognitions facial recognition features aws evaluated photos from a publicly available dataset of million face images and found zero false positive matches at a confidence level aws plans to work with industry and academic groups that specialize in computer vision to help establish additional standardized tests and benchmarks for cloud based facial recognition technology in the two plus years aws has been offering amazon rekognition aws has not received a single report of amazon rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal but is aware of many beneficial purposes of amazon rekognition including by law enforcement to help improve public safety we recognize that users of our technology as with any technology may not only utilize it for beneficial purposes but could also misuse the results generated by our technology just as laptop computers mobile phones or cameras can be misused however we do not believe that the potential for customers to misuse results generated by amazon rekognition should prevent us from making that technology available to our customers if aws did receive reports that a customer including any law enforcement customer was misusing amazon rekognition we would promptly investigate the report and if the customer were found to be using amazon rekognition to violate the law or the aws terms of use or acceptable use policy we would prevent that customer from using the service aws will continue to work with partners across industry government academia and community groups on this topic because we strongly believe that facial recognition is an important even critical tool for business government and law enforcement use in addition to the extent there may be ambiguities or uncertainties in how existing laws should apply to facial recognition technology we have and will continue to offer our support to policymakers and legislators in identifying areas to develop guidance or legislation to clarify the proper application of those laws we also support the calls for an appropriate national legislative framework that protects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their use of facial recognition technology in light of our commitment to customer trust privacy and security the material benefits to both society and organizations of amazon rekognitions image and video analysis capabilities and our commitment to obligations under the aws acceptable use policy the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting a ban on government use of certain technologies item shareholder proposal requesting a report on the impact of government use of certain technologies beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support whereas our company through amazon web services aws developed and is marketing to government and law enforcement agencies a facial recognition system rekognition that we believe may pose significant financial risks due to its privacy and human rights implications whereas human and civil rights organizations are concerned that facial surveillance technology may ultimately violate civil rights by unfairly and disproportionally targeting and surveilling people of color immigrants and civil society organizations whereas hundreds of amazons employees have petitioned our company chief executive officer to stop providing rekognition to government agencies a practice detrimental to internal cohesion morale and which undermines amazon employees commitment to its retail customers by placing those customers at risk of warrantless discriminatory surveillance whereas in the past our company has publicly opposed secret government surveillance and our chief executive officer has personally expressed his support for first amendment freedoms and openly opposed the discriminatory muslim ban whereas the marketing of this technology could also be expanded to foreign authoritarian regimes resulting in our companys surveillance technologies being used to identify and detain democracy advocates whereas over seventy civil and human rights groups joined by academics employees and other stakeholders have called upon our companys chief executive officer to stop selling rekognition enabling a government surveillance infrastructure whereas the american civil liberties union aclu found that amazons rekognition falsely matched members of congress with people who have been arrested for a crime in a test that relied on the softwares default settings whereas there is little evidence to suggest that our board of directors as part of its fiduciary oversight has rigorously assessed the magnitude of risks to our companys financial performance associated with the privacy and human rights threat to customers and other stake holders resolved shareholders request the board of directors commission an independent study of rekognition and report to shareholders regarding the extent to which such technology may endanger threaten or violate privacy and or civil rights and unfairly or disproportionately target or surveil people of color immigrants and activists in the united states the extent to which such technologies may be marketed and sold to authoritarian or repressive foreign governments identified by the united states department of state country reports on human rights practices the financial or operational risks associated with these human rights issues the report should be produced at reasonable expense exclude proprietary or legally privileged information and be published no later than september supporting statement we believe the board of directors fiduciary duty of care extends to thoroughly evaluating the impacts on reputation and shareholder value of any surveillance technology our company produces or markets on which significant concerns are raised regarding the danger to civil and privacy rights of customers and other stakeholders the recent failures of facebook to engage in sufficient content and privacy management and the resulting economic impacts to that company should be taken as sufficient warning it could happen to amazon end of

outlined above we have blocked or removed hundreds of thousands of product listings from its stores during the past months including products that promote incite or glorify hatred violence racial sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views for the foregoing reasons the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting a report on certain products item shareholder proposal requesting an independent board chair policy beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support resolved shareholders of amazon com inc amazon ask the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board to be an independent director the policy should provide that i if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the policy within days of that determination and ii compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair this policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation supporting statement amazons chief executive officer ceo jeff bezos also serves as board chairman we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporations governance which can harm shareholder value as intels former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if hes an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and support strong board oversight proxy advisor glass lewis opined in a report that shareholders are better served when the board is led by an independent chairman who we believe is better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that exist when a ceo or other executive also serves as chairman an independent board chair has been found in academic studies to improve the performance of public companies although evidence overall is inconclusive while separating the roles of chair and ceo is the norm in europe of sp company boards have also implemented this best practice we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly useful at amazon in providing more robust oversight regarding environmental social and governance esg issues amazon has faced increasing criticism over its relationships with key constituencies such as its workers and the communities in which it operates amazons surveillance technology has provoked an outcry from civil rights organizations and may have damaged our companys brand independent board leadership would we think more likely result in improved policies and practices to mitigate these business risks we urge shareholders to vote for this

immigration enforcement story html end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board is committed to strong independent leadership of the board the independent directors on the board have appointed a lead director from the boards independent directors currently jonathan j rubinstein former co ceo of bridgewater associates in order to promote independent leadership of the board and address the governance concerns listed in the shareholder proposal the lead director presides over the executive sessions of the independent directors chairs board meetings in the chairs absence and provides direction on agendas schedules information and materials for board meetings that will be most helpful to the independent directors in addition the lead director confers from time to time with the chair of the board and the independent directors and reviews as appropriate the annual schedule of regular board meetings and major board meeting agenda topics the guidance and direction provided by the lead director reinforce the boards independent oversight of management and contribute to communication among members of the board the board believes that this leadership structure improves the boards ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps us operate in the long term interests of shareholders while maintaining a strong independent perspective in addition the board believes flexibility in board leadership structure is more suitable for us than a rigid and prescriptive approach instead this proposal if implemented would require the board to immediately remove mr bezos from his position as chair rather than allowing the board to for example assess the issue at some point in the future when there is a leadership transition we do not believe that such an immediate transition would be in the best interests of amazon or our shareholders our directors have a fiduciary duty to routinely evaluate and determine the most appropriate leadership structure for amazon and its shareholders in light of our specific characteristics or circumstances at any given time accordingly our governing documents provide the board with the flexibility to determine the optimal leadership structure for amazon including when appropriate separating the positions of chair of the board and ceo the board believes that amazon and its shareholders benefit from this flexibility and that the directors are best positioned to lead this evaluation given their knowledge of our leadership team strategic goals opportunities and challenges the board has selected our founder and ceo jeff bezos as the chair of the board the board believes that mr bezos role in founding amazon and his significant ownership stake in amazon positions him well to work with the board on the key policy and operational issues that will help us operate in the long term interests of shareholders in this regard our stock has significantly outperformed the sp over the last and year periods for example over the last five years our stock has increased approximately while the sp has risen approximately we believe that it is important for the board to continue to determine on a case by case basis the most effective leadership structure for us rather than take a rigid approach to board leadership as called for by the shareholder proposal in addition in reviewing this proposal the board took into consideration relevant benchmarking data and concluded that the proposals approach is not common practice for example as of of sp companies combined the chairman and ceo roles including berkshire hathaway att and general electric while a significantly lower percentage require the chair to be independent as requested by this proposal in addition our existing corporate governance practices reinforce the boards alignment with and accountability to shareholders our current practices include annual election of directors majority voting for each director proxy access an annual director evaluation process a shareholder right to call special meetings at which they can nominate director candidates or propose other business a shareholder right to submit names of director candidates directly to the board for consideration and a shareholder right to communicate directly with the board in the manner described in

shareholder proposal requesting a board ideology disclosure policy beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support true diversity board policy resolved that the shareholders of the amazon com inc the company request the board adopt a policy to disclose to shareholders the following a description of the specific minimum qualifications that the boards nominating committee believes must be met by a nominee to be on the board of directors and each nominees skills ideological perspectives and experience presented in a chart or matrix form the disclosure shall be presented to the shareholders through the annual proxy statement and the companys website within six months of the date of the annual meeting and updated on an annual basis supporting statement we believe that boards that incorporate diverse perspectives can think more critically and oversee corporate managers more effectively by providing a meaningful disclosure about potential board members shareholders will be better able to judge how well suited individual board nominees are for the company and whether their listed skills experience and attributes are appropriate in light of the companys overall business strategy the companys compliance with item c v of sec regulation s k requires it to identify the minimum skills experience and attributes that all board candidates are expected to possess ideological diversity contemplates differences in political policy beliefs true diversity comes from diversity of thought there is ample evidence that the many companies operate in ideological hegemony that eschews conservative people thoughts and values this ideological echo chamber can result in groupthink that is the antithesis of diversity this can be a major risk factor for shareholders we believe a diverse board is a good indicator of sound corporate governance and a well functioning board diversity in board composition is best achieved through highly qualified candidates with a wide range of skills experience beliefs and board independence from management we are requesting comprehensive disclosures about board composition and what qualifications the company seeks for its board therefore we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item diversity is a cornerstone of our continued success and we are proud of the diversity of experience and perspectives represented by our directors and our employees as amazons ceo has stated were a company of builders whose diverse backgrounds ideas and points of view are critical to helping us invent on behalf of all our customers but its not only that diversity and inclusion are good for our business its more fundamental than thatits simply right these are enduring values for usand nothing will change that our board composition reflects the robust nominating processes that we already have in place which address much of what this proposal requests as stated in the board of directors guidelines on significant corporate governance issues the nominating and corporate governance committee seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives including diversity with respect to race gender geography and areas of expertise among the qualifications and skills of a candidate considered important by the nominating and corporate governance committee are a commitment to representing the long term interests of shareholders customer experience skills internet savvy an inquisitive and objective perspective the willingness to take appropriate risks leadership ability human capital management personal and professional ethics integrity and values practical wisdom and sound judgment and business and professional experience in fields such as retail operations technology finance accounting product development intellectual property law multimedia entertainment and marketing our director nominees individual qualifications skills and experience are discussed above in director nominees biographical and related information our processes for nominating directors are designed to advance the long term interests of shareholders by constituting a board that reflects a diversity of experience and perspectives the nominating and corporate governance committee annually reviews the tenure performance and contributions of existing board members and considers all aspects of each candidates qualifications and skills in the context of the companys needs at that point in time as demonstrated by the director nominees that the nominating and corporate governance committee has recommended for election at the annual meeting we believe these processes have produced a board with deep business acumen that reflects and benefits from a diversity of perspectives engages in robust discussions and makes well informed decisions given our robust processes for nominating directors and our existing disclosures regarding the diversity of experience and perspectives represented by our board members the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting a board ideology disclosure policy item shareholder proposal requesting changes to the companys gender pay reporting beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support gender pay equity whereas the world economic forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy trillion dollars annually the median income for women working full time in the united states is percent of that of their male counterparts this disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career the gap for african american and latina women is percent and percent at the current rate women will not reach pay parity until united states companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs but mostly ignore median pay gaps regulation in the united kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps and while amazon impressively reported no median hourly pay gap with women earning percent more than men for its united kingdom operations it has not published median information for its global operations amazon reports that in women earned percent of the compensation received by men on a statistically adjusted equal pay basis including base salary and stock and minorities received percent of the compensation received by white employees yet those statistically adjusted numbers alone fail to consider how discrimination affects differences in opportunity in contrast median pay gap disclosures address the structural bias that affects the jobs women hold particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs women account for percent of amazons employees but only percent of our companys leadership mercer finds actively managing pay equity is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation research from morgan stanley mckinsey and robeco sam suggests gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity mckinsey states the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling best practices include tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps public policy risk is of concern not only in the united kingdom but in the united states as well the paycheck fairness act pends before senate california massachusetts new york and maryland have strengthened equal pay legislation the congressional joint economic committee reports percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination resolved shareholders request amazon report on the companys global median gender pay gap including associated policy reputational competitive and operational risks and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent the report should be prepared at reasonable cost omitting proprietary information litigation strategy and legal compliance information the gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings organization for economic cooperation and development supporting statement a report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity including base bonus and equity compensation end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item we believe that people should receive equal pay for equal work regardless of gender or race and are committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably since at least amazon has reported on key workforce demographics including providing information on its gender pay gap on an annual basis the reported gender pay statistics demonstrate that amazon pays its employees comparably when analyzing the work of people performing the same jobs when evaluating compensation in the u s our reported data demonstrates that women earned cents for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs and minorities earned cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing the same jobs we also are strongly committed to increasing gender and racial diversity including among our leadership ranks as disclosed on our diversity website we are continuing to invest in our efforts to bring more women and minorities into leadership positions at amazonwe have an executive recruiting team focused on hiring more diverse talent participate in events and partnerships with groups likeanitab organd wepowertech and have introduced several programs to develop diverse leaders into more senior roles reporting an unadjusted global median wage gap statistic annually would not advance our deep commitment to ensuring equal pay for equal work an unadjusted global median pay statistic does not account for differences in pay practices across countries such as cost of living job function level labor force participation rates country currency geography and other factors that impact differences in compensation on a global basis we believe that the global pay gap information that we review and disclose publicly each year which incorporates these differences provides a more accurate picture of our global pay policies and practices as reflected by our published pay information we are committed to fairly and equitably compensating our employees our compensation policies and practices are designed to ensure that employees are compensated in accordance with their jobs and level without regard to gender or race we ensure that our policies and practices are consistently implemented in accordance with the law by annually reviewing employee compensation along with providing equitable compensation we are deeply committed to creating an environment where all employees can be successful and thrive here too the workforce demographics demonstrate that amazon continues to make progress year over year with more than employees worldwide we have increased the percentage of women and u s underrepresented racial ethnic minorities across our tech and non tech corporate roles over the past three years our commitment to diversity and inclusion is further fostered by our ten employee led affinity groups reaching employees in over chapters globally we have innovative benefit offerings and host annual and ongoing learning experiences including conversations on race and ethnicity core and amazecon gender

publicly available at http www amazon com diversity given our focused attention on ensuring equal pay practices through its policies and practices as reflected by its published pay statistics the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting changes to the companys gender pay reporting item shareholder proposal requesting a report on integrating certain metrics into executive compensation beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support whereas studies suggest that companies that integrate environmental social and governance esg factors into business strategy reduce reputational legal and regulatory risks and improve long term performance a leading group of companies has integrated sustainability metrics into executive pay incentive plans among them unilever and walmart guidance from the un principles for responsible investment states that including esg factors in executive incentive schemes can help protect long term shareholder value diversity inclusion and equity are key components of business sustainability and success mckinsey research shows that companies in the top quartiles for gender and racial ethnic diversity were more likely to have above average financial returns diversity matters mckinsey company in a catalyst report diversity was positively associated with more customers increased sales revenue and greater relative profits yet technology companies have not seized this opportunity underrepresented people of color hold just percent of technical roles in the sector intel dalberg women hold percent of entry level tech jobs and just percent of c suite positions women in the workplace mckinsey the tech diversity crisis creates challenges for talent acquisition and retention product development and customer service these human capital risks are playing out at amazon in the rev jesse jackson observed that amazons board is still all white it does not represent americas talent and americas opportunity bloomberg businessweek argued that among the major tech companies struggling with diversity and inclusion amazon is one of the bigger sinners amazon has a rare chance to get more diverse fast bloomberg businessweek amazon has taken steps to address diversity however challenges are mounting as amazon remains predominantly white and male especially in leadership roles among amazons top executives in according to the most recent eeo report made available just percent were women and only one executive was an underrepresented person of color according to the above bloomberg businessweek report o f the people who report directly to chief executive officer jeff bezos all are white and only one is a woman investors seek clarity regarding how amazon drives improvement and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability clearly disclosed comprehensive links among sustainability diversity and executive compensation would enhance amazons approach peers such as microsoft intel and ibm have already set diversity goals and begun linking parts of compensation to such goals amazon should consider changing to keep pace with leaders and to strengthen human capital management resolved shareholders request the board compensation committee prepare a report assessing the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics including metrics regarding diversity among senior executives into performance measures or vesting conditions that may apply to senior executives under the companys compensation plans or arrangements for the purposes of this proposal sustainability is defined as how environmental and social considerations and related financial impacts are integrated into long term corporate strategy and diversity refers to gender racial and ethnic diversity end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item we believe strongly in integrating environmental social and governance considerations into our business strategy and have many sustainability initiatives as discussed on our sustainability website at https www aboutamazon com sustainability for example we have conducted an extensive project over the past several years to develop an advanced scientific model to carefully map our carbon footprint to provide our business teams with detailed information helping them identify ways to reduce carbon use in their businesses an additional example of our commitment to sustainability is our project shipment zero which is our vision to make all amazon shipments net zero carbon with of all shipments net zero by to track our progress on this journey and as part of an overall commitment to sharing our sustainability goals we plan to share amazons company wide carbon footprint along with related goals and programs later in as part of shipment zero we will continue to use our scale and the feedback customers share with us to enable and encourage suppliers up and down our supply chain to reduce their own environmental impact just as weve done with programs like ship in own container and frustration free packaging similarly we take seriously our commitment to diversity and respect for diverse backgrounds including gender race ethnicity religion sexual orientation disability and other dimensions of diversity which are enduring values for us as reflected in a number of our policies as discussed on our diversity at amazon website at https www amazon com diversity we believe that the pursuit of sustainability and diversity goals can enhance long term shareholder value see https blog aboutamazon com sustainability delivering shipment zero a vision for net zero carbon shipments see https blog aboutamazon com sustainability reinventing an american icon we likewise have established our executive compensation program to support long term shareholder value and therefore believe that we already are effectively addressing the objectives of this proposal the primary component of senior executives total compensation at amazon is stock based compensation while it would be possible to integrate performance metrics including sustainability metrics into the vesting conditions that apply to executives under our compensation arrangements we believe that our existing executive compensation arrangements tightly align senior executive compensation with amazons long term success as a result we are not in favor of performance measures in general and we note that our shareholders have consistently approved our executive compensation program including the lack of performance measures in prior years with over votes in favor because we believe that addressing sustainability and diversity goals also support long term value we believe our existing executive compensation arrangements already address the objectives of this proposal for the foregoing reasons the board therefore recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal requesting a report on integrating certain metrics into executive compensation item shareholder proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals beginning of shareholder proposal and statement of support unequal voting at amazon whereas many american corporations employ a poor governance practice that gives boards unwarranted power to disregard investor concerns this practiceknown as formula swappinghas caused more than shareholder proposals that earned a winning or greater simple majority vote to instead be regarded as failing the key is how abstain votes are treated for example a plum creek timber proposal on political spending garnered a simple majority vote of percent however the companys use of formula swapping dropped the vote by percent and changed the outcome to a failing percent using formula swapping amazon packs abstain votes into the formula against shareholder proposals ignoring voter intent formula swapping mathematically converts every abstention into an against vote reducing the percentage cast in favor these distorted figures are then reported by the press and often become enshrined in company sec filings amazon engages in this kind of formula swapping using a favorable simple majority vote counting formula for board elections but a more repressive formula to count votes on shareholder proposals the inconsistent treatment of these management proposals versus shareholder proposals disproportionately benefits managements board vote while depressing the tally on shareholder items this constitutes poor governanceformula swapping puts stockholders at a disadvantage and reflects the faulty logic that a company can judge voter intent how did this come to be under rule a the sec mandates use of a fair simple majority standard for divided by for against to determine a proposals resubmission eligibilityabstentions are barred from this sec formula other than this state law typically governs and the sec cannot direct how companies count votes historically competition for corporate registrations resulted in a race to the bottom in which states permitted companies to adopt confusing inconsistent and discriminatory voting practicespractices that continue to disadvantage shareholders to this day policy of the council of institutional investors cii the voice of corporate governance declares that abstentions should be counted only for purposes of a quorum emphasis added accordingly please vote for this common sense proposal that counters the systemic disadvantaging of stockholdersand instead seeks a level playing field where amazon does not count its board proposal more leniently than shareholder proposals resolved shareholders ask the board of amazon com inc to take steps to amend company governing documents to provide that all non binding matters presented by shareholders shall be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast for and against an item this policy would apply to all such matters unless shareholders have approved higher thresholds or applicable laws or stock exchange regulations dictate otherwise end of shareholder proposal and statement of support recommendation of the board of directors on item the board regularly reviews our corporate governance practices including the methodologies for how votes are cast the board has undertaken several steps to improve our governance practices including adopting proxy access and majority voting for directors the board does not however believe that the actions requested by the proposal represent a necessary change to our governance practices this vote counting proposal failed at our annual meeting of shareholders with approximately of the shares present at the meeting did not support such proposal and our annual meeting of shareholders with approximately of the shares present at the meeting did not support such proposal use of the proponents proposed vote counting methodology would not have changed such outcomes our vote counting methodology is consistent with delaware law which applies to amazon by virtue of its incorporation in that state section of the delaware general corporation law provides as a default that in all matters other than the election of directors the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders because shares that vote to abstain are present and entitled to vote under this delaware law standard any shares present at the meeting that abstain from voting are essentially counted as votes against the matter our vote counting practices are fair and consistent with practices of peer companies the vote counting methodology we use does not inherently favor proposals submitted by the board over proposals submitted by shareholders as the vote counting standard for approving any proposal other than for the election of directors is identical thus we apply the same vote counting standard to our own advisory votes on executive compensation for example as we do to a shareholder proposal in addition the vote counting methodology we use is the standard applied by a majority of our peers incorporated in delaware and according to a study by gmi ratings by a majority of sp companies the board believes that changing our vote counting practices would not be in the best interests of our shareholders all shares present in person or represented by proxy at our annual meeting are entitled to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement the board believes that it is the responsibility of anyone putting a proposal forward for shareholders to approveregardless of whether amazon or a shareholder proponentto persuade shareholders owning a majority of the shares that vote to support the proposal abstentions reflect the fact that a shareholder has reviewed and evaluated a proposal but has not been persuaded to support the proposal further shareholders are clearly told the effect of an abstaining vote as opposed to ignoring shareholders who abstain we believe it appropriate to count abstentions as present at the annual meeting and entitled to vote and thus as relevant in determining whether a majority of the shares present have voted in favor of a proposal the effect of changing our vote counting methodology to completely remove abstentions from the results of a vote would be to disenfranchise those voters who chose to abstain from voting it would remove one of the voters three options as a vote to abstain itself is a position taken by a shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the board changing the manner in which abstentions are counted in shareholder votes would not have been determinative in any of the proposals voted on by our shareholders since we went public in over that time if the proponents proposed vote counting methodology had been used it would never have increased the voting results for a proposal by more than and would never have resulted in a different outcome in terms of whether a proposal passed or failed our vote counting methodology is both consistent with delaware law and fair to shareholders the board believes that it is important to recognize the voices of all shareholders including those who choose to abstain from voting on a particular proposal therefore the board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal the board recommends that you vote against this proposal regarding vote counting practices for shareholder proposals beneficial ownership of shares the following table sets

compensation philosophy as stated in the companys letter to shareholders we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term as a result we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies for example under our compensation philosophy we have prioritized stock based compensation that vests over an extended period of time in addition we believe granting stock based compensation to employees results in motivated customer centric people who think and act like owners because they are owners our compensation philosophy for our named executive officers identified in the summary compensation table below is generally the same as for all of our employees who receive equity compensation and is governed by the following principles first our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above industry average compensation assuming stock price performance second our compensation program provides strong long term incentives to align our employees interests with our shareholders interests third our compensation program emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long term success as a basis for compensation increases as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service finally our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values including customer obsession innovation bias for action acting like owners and thinking long term a high hiring bar and frugality for our named executive officers who are employed on an at will basis we provide few perquisites and generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a new hire context we do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans supplemental executive retirement plan benefits cash severance programs or change in control benefits for our executive officers additionally except as noted below in certain circumstances we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to performance criteria which could cause employees to focus solely on short term returns at the expense of long term growth and innovation we believe that investing in the creation of long term value without the use of performance measures or specific indices is optimal for amazon employees particularly at the executive level and for shareholders we believe that the best measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term to help align our executives with long term value creation we compensate them with restricted stock unit awards that have long vesting periods over time executives will have multiple restricted stock unit awards that vest over many years and thus provide a greater amount of potential compensation in later years than the current year this encourages them to seek out develop and pursue initiatives that focus on serving our customers and reflect a long term view for thinking about our operations holistically and contributing to initiatives across the company because of our executives low salaries the absence of an annual bonus program and reliance on restricted stock units with long vesting periods we believe that our executives compensation is tightly aligned with our shareholders long term interests and therefore that performance conditions on our stock awards are neither necessary nor given the nature of our business appropriate as a company that relentlessly pursues invention across a wide range of opportunities we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize a few discrete or short term financial or operational performance measures that may narrowly focus our executives on the success of only isolated initiatives instead of on the long term success of the company as a whole for example in we could have adopted performance measures appropriate for an internet bookseller but those performance measures may have discouraged our employees from investing their time and energy into initiatives that later became aws kindle and alexa other examples of long term focus include the development of our third party seller business which was aided by the lessons learned from our unsuccessful efforts to build an auctions marketplace and when we experimented with adding services other than fast shipping to our prime membership program a performance goal assumes some level of success by a prescribed measure but to have a culture that relentlessly pursues invention we have to encourage experimentation and long term thinking which by definition means we do not know in advance whether it will work in addition given the unique nature of amazon and our many initiatives standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to serve as relevant comparisons for benchmarking performance for example if we had tied compensation to our performance relative to a retail index we might never have pursued our aws business since executives would have been penalized for making the early investments in cloud technology and infrastructure that aws required similarly if we tied compensation to our performance relative to a technology index we might not have built our own devices developed our own movies and tv shows or innovated shipping and delivery methods a customized index locks in a business profile at a point in time and may deter employees from considering or pursuing initiatives that do not fit into that mold thus we think the best stock market comparison we can make is measuring our own success can we continue to grow our share value over the long term as a result we believe the best performance measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term therefore when we set our executives target compensation we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price so that our executives compensation will be negatively impacted if our stock price is flat or declines and is favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial stock price assumption this approach has served our employees and shareholders well over the past three years as our stock price has increased approximately between january and december base salaries consistent with our philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long term shareholder value base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior leadership at similarly situated companies base salaries ranged from for mr bezos to for messrs blackburn jassy and wilke due to mr bezos substantial ownership in amazon mr bezos requested not to receive additional compensation and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount stock based compensation the primary component of a named executive officers total compensation is stock based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long term shareholder value accordingly named executive officers receive sizeable stock based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock based awards on a periodic basis because our compensation program is designed to reward long term performance and operate over a period of years named executive officers may not necessarily receive stock based awards every year for example because annual total compensation as reported in the summary compensation table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award granted in that year without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years a named executive officers total compensation as reported will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he or she does not receive a grant due to mr bezos substantial stock ownership he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders interests mr bezos has never received any stock based compensation from amazon since late we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock based compensation vehicle we believe that restricted stock units align the long term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting for named executive officers whether for new hire or subsequent grants are established by the leadership development and compensation committee after receiving recommendations from the senior vice president of human resources and the chief executive officer these restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of five or six years vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a change in control unless the leadership development and compensation committee determines that the acquiring company will not be assuming or substituting the awards for new hire grants and grants made in connection with internal promotions the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including past compensation from the named executive officers former employer future compensation from such former employer that will be forfeited upon joining the company the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at amazon the named executive officers expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success and the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies for periodic grants the senior vice president of human resources the chief executive officer and the leadership development and compensation committee consider a variety of factors including the named executive officers level of responsibility past contributions to our performance including our core values and expected contributions to our future success as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail internet and technology companies generally the leadership development and compensation committee considers whether to make periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process which normally occurs between january and april for both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer develop grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price appreciation assumptions taking into account the named executive officers cash compensation and the estimated value of pre existing stock based compensation vesting in subsequent years if any in this process the senior vice president of human resources and chief executive officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock based compensation vesting in that year because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation in april messrs olsavsky and blackburn received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may and messrs jassy and wilke received restricted stock unit awards with vesting beginning in may assuming continued employment as follows mr olsavsky received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr olsavskys experience and skill as chief financial officer his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr blackburn received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr blackburns experience and skill in managing the companys business development and media projects his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr jassy received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr jassys experience and skill in managing amazon web services operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions mr wilke received a restricted stock unit award for shares in making this grant the leadership development and compensation committee considered the factors discussed above with respect to periodic grants including mr wilkes experience and skill in managing worldwide consumer operations his sustained performance over time in years preceding the grant and his expected future contributions in setting these amounts the leadership development and compensation committee considered the vesting schedule of existing equity awards as well as aggregated information from third party surveys including compensation data for retail internet technology and media companies including alphabet apple att best buy cisco ebay facebook general electric honeywell ibm intel microsoft oracle starbucks target walmart and the walt disney company the leadership development and compensation committee exercises discretion in determining executive officers compensation and does not require that compensation be set at a specific level relative to what is reflected in the survey data in addition messrs jassy and wilke each received an additional restricted stock unit award for shares which vest in in in and in these grants were given in recognition of these executives level of responsibility and expected contribution to our future success over the long term the total number of restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers during the three year period from to represented only i of the total number of restricted stock units granted to all employees during the same three year period and ii of the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the same three year period we impose additional vesting conditions on certain stock based awards issued to named executive officers for equity awards granted prior to tax law changes these conditions were intended to qualify the stock based awards as tax deductible compensation under section m c of the internal revenue code however there is no guarantee that these awards will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the internal revenue service as a result of changes to the tax laws we expect that equity awards granted or other compensation provided under arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after november generally will not be deductible to the extent they result in compensation to certain of our named executive officers for or after that exceeds million in any one year for any such officer new hire cash bonuses none of the named executive officers received a new hire cash bonus in other compensation and benefits named executive officers receive additional compensation in the form of vacation medical k relocation and other benefits generally available to all of our employees at times we may provide security for mr bezos and certain other executive officers including security in addition to that provided at business facilities and during business related travel we believe that all company incurred security costs are reasonable and necessary and for the companys benefit the leadership development and compensation committee periodically reviews the amount and nature of executive officers security expenses reportable security expenses are included in the all other compensation column of the summary compensation table we do not provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers clawback policy as set forth in our board of directors guidelines on significant corporate governance issues we have a
