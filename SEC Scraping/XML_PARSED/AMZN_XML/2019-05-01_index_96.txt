amazon has been responsive to public controversy the company has been less responsive to over a dozen shareholders who expressed concerns about rekognition in june on june th the lead proponent of this resolution was also the lead signatory on an initial letter by financial services firms holding amazon stock including wealth management companies and registered investment advisors raising strong objections to the introduction of the companys facial recognition technology not only did amazon not reply to the initial communication there was no acknowledgment of receipt of the communication such initial issues raised specifically included substantial risks for our company negatively impacting our companys stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders the june th letter also stated we have seen no evidence of our board of directors conducting fiduciary oversight on how rekognition may or may not should or should not be deployed the recent experience and scrutiny of facebook demonstrated the degree to which these new issues may undermine company value as the detrimental impacts on society become clear while rekognition may be intended to enhance some law enforcement activity we are deeply concerned it may ultimately violate civil and human rights while the accuracy of rekognitions technology is a concern multiple studies by m i t researchers and the aclu have found that racial and gender bias is embedded in rekognition there are more fundamental issues including whether facial recognition should be deployed at all because of the role the technology plays in enabling ubiquitous government surveillance indeed scientific and academic research suggests that over time the societal risks embedded in a technology such as rekognition may not decline but may instead increase quickly and dramatically as rekognition is deployed more widely in april prominent artificial intelligence researchers including experts at amazon competitors google facebook and microsoft and a winner of the prestigious turing award called on amazon to stop selling rekognition to government there are no laws or required standards to ensure that rekognition is used in a manner that does not infringe on civil liberties the ai researchers wrote this is particularly concerning for those whose human rights are neglected by autocratic government regimes human rights organizations cite the deployment of facial recognition in china where according to one expert surveillance technologies are giving the government a sense that it can finally achieve the level of control over peoples lives that it aspires to scholars woodrow hartzog and evan selinger have written we believe facial recognition technology is the most uniquely dangerous surveillance mechanism

manifestation of these potential harms could result in a negative financial impact on amazon through for example a decrease in sales or contracts due to diminished consumer trust that negatively impacts the demand for amazon products and services and increases the cost of business research shows that being linked to adverse human rights impacts can negatively impact a companys reputation and harm its potential to secure future contracts a recent study quantifying the material impact of the reputational harm for energy transfer partners etp due to its inadequate stakeholder consultation

expectations as a result of the controversy growing and widespread social controversy and public pressure surrounding rekognition may negatively impact amazons financial performance privacy as a material financial risk rekognition as a potential tool for surveillance when sold to government already presents material issues for amazon regarding consumer privacy according to the sustainability accounting standards board sasb which identifies environmental social and governance factors most likely to materially impact the financial condition or operating performance of companies in an industry consumer privacy is likely to be a material issue for companies operating in technology and communications this includes the management of risks related to the use of personally identifiable

collection of facial imagery and managing evolving regulation such as regulation around the commercial use of facial recognition reputational risk posed by sales of rekognition to government the public controversy surrounding rekognition presents critical risks to the companys reputation including the willingness of consumers to trust the company to safeguard their privacy and civil and human rights because storing your data on their cloud requires that you trust them to keep your data safe therefore consumer trust is one of amazons most important intangible assets this comes as amazon with its leadership position in the technology sector confronts growing public criticism regarding the role of technology companies including amazon com and its products and services in societies and economies around the world thus proponents believe rekognition may threaten amazons long term prospects amazon is the subject of mounting public controversy because of this product in may the aclu along with a coalition of civil rights organizations sent a public letter to the company demanding that it stop selling rekognition to government in january over activist groups including the aclu the

if amazons ability to maintain the trust of customers is breached by concerns about privacy and surveillance moreover in addition to the companys unique exposure to risk by virtue of it being a business operating in the technology sector it also has a product pipeline and pending patent applications which demonstrate the trajectory of the company will confront just such concerns for example two facial recognition related patent applications filed by the company feature a technology that could use multiple cameras to create a composite image of a persons partially seen face and could then automatically alert law enforcement if a suspicious person or known criminal is in view of rings cameras only this month multiple media outlets sparked controversy with reports that amazon employees

protest saying we learn from history and we understand how ibms systems were employed in the s to help hitler ibm did not take responsibility then and by the time their role was understood it was too late we will not let that happen again the time to act is now we call on you to stop selling facial recognition services to law enforcement in addition to products that present these concerns surveillance issues raised by rekognition are mirrored within the company itself in how it tracks its own employees the company was granted two patents recently that would allow it to track its workers hand movements through wristbands by tracking detailed movements through artificial intelligence technologies the company can also obtain and record highly private information such as when an employee takes a bathroom break this degree of monitoring adds fourth amendment privacy intrusion concerns to the mix of a work culture already criticized for pressuring employees to work long hours and perform above all else and investors need more information about how surveillance issues may be threatening the long term performance and health of the company overall investors need more information from the company so they can be assured that the companys policies and practices are sufficient to protect shareholders and the public from the risks posed by sales of rekognition to government amazons existing policy to mitigate risks of sales of rekognition are insufficient and ineffectual in its opposition statement amazon argued that the aws acceptable use policy protects against risks posed by illegal or harmful use of rekognition amazon asserts in the opposition statement that customers who gain access to deploy rekognition must comply with its acceptable use policy which prohibits the use of its products for any illegal harmful fraudulent infringing or offensive use including the violation of laws related to privacy discrimination and civil rights and that amazon has not received a single report of rekognition being used in a harmful manner as posited in the proposal recent experience however demonstrates that the acceptable use policy is no guarantee that the aws platform will not be used in a harmful manner according to multiple media reports a mexico based news site used amazon servers to openly store million records on facebook users including identification numbers comments reactions and account names the problem was detected by researchers at an independent security firm which reportedly sent emails to amazon over many months to alert it to the problem amazon reportedly failed to respond to those messages https newsroom accenture com news us college graduates value culture over compensation according to accenture strategy research htm https gizmodo com amazon workers demand jeff bezos cancel face recognitio https adage com article digital millions facebook records found amazon cloud servers amazon itself has shifted its stated position that existing company policies protect users and the company from significant risk for example in the face of the groundswell of concern by ngos and civil liberties experts a leading company spokesman as discussed above and in the opposition statement to the proposal tempered the companys position calling for government regulation and dialogue among stakeholders including shareholders it is frankly difficult to understand why the company is opposing the current proposal as the proposal itself seems to provide the opportunity to fulfill exactly the terms of amazons own invitation for open honest and earnest dialogue with key stakeholders shareholders are concerned with violations by government customers particularly currently the fbi is petitioning for face recognition systems to be exempt from the prohibitions on tracking people during the exercise of their right to free speech in addition long standing rules that have precluded the fbi and department of homeland security from tracking the identity of individuals during the exercise of free speech appear to be at risk therefore the acceptable use policy provisions are far from self executing and as the example of the fbi request for waiver of normal civil liberties protections demonstrates the evidence shows that the acceptable use policy is ineffective at protecting people from the harms of surveillance technology in the hands of government insufficient board oversight of risks related to rekognition governance of the significant risks presented by rekognition is lacking instead of company oversight it appears that the responsibility falls to the customer for ensuring that the technology is not used in illegal or harmful ways that threaten shareholder value this is too significant of an issue for the company to abdicate its responsibility to protect human rights the proponents are concerned that the amazon board is not equipped to adequately identify and assess the risks posed by rekognition the directors overall lack expertise that would give them the background or tools to assess the human rights impacts of machine learning artificial intelligence and the primary technologies behind a product like rekognition one possible exception is director daniel huttenlocher who holds a ph d in computer science from mit and hails an interest in emerging technologies the board also lacks any governance committee tasked with overseeing these risks therefore an evaluation conducted by an independent group of experts of the risks posed by sales of rekognition to government is necessary to

concerns posed by the sale of technologies amazon maintains three board committees a leadership development and compensation committee an audit committee and a nominating and corporate governance

recognition technology unlike some other companies google cloud has chosen not to offer general purpose facial recognition apis before working through important technology and policy questions this is
