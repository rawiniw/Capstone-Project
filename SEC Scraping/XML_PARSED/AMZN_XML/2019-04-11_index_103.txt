amazon com inc registrant by s david a zapolsky david a zapolsky senior vice president dated april ex d dex htm ex ex exhibit to our shareowners something strange and remarkable has happened over the last years take a look at these numbers the percentages represent the share of physical gross merchandise sales sold on amazon by independent third party sellers mostly small and medium sized businesses as opposed to amazon retails own first party sales third party sales have grown from of the total to to put it bluntly third party sellers are kicking our first party butt badly and its a high bar too because our first party business has grown dramatically over that period from billion in to billion this past year the compound annual growth rate for our first party business in that time period is but in that same time third party sales have grown from billion to billion a compound annual growth rate of to provide an external benchmark ebays gross merchandise sales in that period have grown at a compound rate of from billion to billion why did independent sellers do so much better selling on amazon than they did on ebay and why were independent sellers able to grow so much faster than amazons own highly organized first party sales organization there isnt one answer but we do know one extremely important part of the answer we helped independent sellers compete against our first party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build there are many such tools including tools that help sellers manage inventory process payments track shipments create reports and sell across borders and were inventing more every year but of great importance are fulfillment by amazon and the prime membership program in combination these two programs meaningfully improved the customer experience of buying from independent sellers with the success of these two programs now so well established its difficult for most people to fully appreciate today just how radical those two offerings were at the time we launched them we invested in both of these programs at significant financial risk and after much internal debate we had to continue investing significantly over time as we experimented with different ideas and iterations we could not foresee with certainty what those programs would eventually look like let alone whether they would succeed but they were pushed forward with intuition and heart and nourished with optimism intuition curiosity and the power of wandering from very early on in amazons life we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders people who are curious explorers they like to invent even when theyre experts they are fresh with a beginners mind they see the way we do things as just the way we do things now a builders mentality helps us approach big hard to solve opportunities with a humble conviction that success can come through iteration invent launch reinvent relaunch start over rinse repeat again and again they know the path to success is anything but straight sometimes often actually in business you do know where youre going and when you do you can be efficient put in place a plan and execute in contrast wandering in business is not efficient but its also not random its guided by hunch gut intuition curiosity and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that its worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there wandering is an essential counter balance to efficiency you need to employ both the outsized discoveries the non linear ones are highly likely to require wandering awss millions of customers range from startups to large enterprises government entities to nonprofits each looking to build better solutions for their end users we spend a lot of time thinking about what those organizations want and what the people inside them developers dev managers ops managers cios chief digital officers chief information security officers etc want much of what we build at aws is based on listening to customers its critical to ask customers what they want listen carefully to their answers and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly speed matters in business no business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession but its also not enough the biggest needle movers will be things that customers dont know to ask for we must invent on their behalf we have to tap into our own inner imagination about whats possible aws itself as a whole is an example no one asked for aws no one turns out the world was in fact ready and hungry for an offering like aws but didnt know it we had a hunch followed our curiosity took the necessary financial risks and began building reworking experimenting and iterating countless times as we proceeded within aws that same pattern has recurred many times for example we invented dynamodb a highly scalable low latency key value database now used by thousands of aws customers and on the listening carefully to customers side we heard loudly that companies felt constrained by their commercial database options and had been unhappy with their database providers for decades these offerings are expensive proprietary have high lock in and punitive licensing terms we spent several years building our own database engine amazon aurora a fully managed mysql and postgresql compatible service with the same or better durability and availability as the commercial engines but at one tenth of the cost we were not surprised when this worked but were also optimistic about specialized databases for specialized workloads over the past to years companies ran most of their workloads using relational databases the broad familiarity with relational databases among developers made this technology the go to even when it wasnt ideal though sub optimal the data set sizes were often small enough and the acceptable query latencies long enough that you could make it work but today many applications are storing very large amounts of data terabytes and petabytes and the requirements for apps have changed modern applications are driving the need for low latencies real time processing and the ability to process millions of requests per second its not just key value stores like dynamodb but also in memory databases like amazon elasticache time series databases like amazon timestream and ledger solutions like amazon quantum ledger database the right tool for the right job saves money and gets your product to market faster were also plunging into helping companies harness machine learning weve been working on this for a long time and as with other important advances our initial attempts to externalize some of our early internal machine learning tools were failures it took years of wandering experimentation iteration and refinement as well as valuable insights from our customers to enable us to find sagemaker which launched just months ago sagemaker removes the heavy lifting complexity and guesswork from each step of the machine learning process democratizing ai today thousands of customers are building machine learning models on top of aws with sagemaker we continue to enhance the service including by adding new reinforcement learning capabilities reinforcement learning has a steep learning curve and many moving parts which has largely put it out of reach of all but the most well funded and technical organizations until now none of this would be possible without a culture of curiosity and a willingness to try totally new things on behalf of customers and customers are responding to our customer centric wandering and listening aws is now a billion annual run rate business and growing fast imagining the impossible amazon today remains a small player in global retail we represent a low single digit percentage of the retail market and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate and thats largely because nearly of retail remains offline in brick and mortar stores for many years we considered how we might serve customers in physical stores but felt we needed first to invent something that would really delight customers in that environment with amazon go we had a clear vision get rid of the worst thing about physical retail checkout lines no one likes to wait in line instead we imagined a store where you could walk in pick up what you wanted and leave getting there was hard technically hard it required the efforts of hundreds of smart dedicated computer scientists and engineers around the world we had to design and build our own proprietary cameras and shelves and invent new computer vision algorithms including the ability to stitch together imagery from hundreds of cooperating cameras and we had to do it in a way where the technology worked so well that it simply receded into the background invisible the reward has been the response from customers whove described the experience of shopping at amazon go as magical we now have stores in chicago san francisco and seattle and are excited about the future failure needs to scale too as a company grows everything needs to scale including the size of your failed experiments if the size of your failures isnt growing youre not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle amazon will be experimenting at the right scale for a company of our size if we occasionally have multibillion dollar failures of course we wont undertake such experiments cavalierly we will work hard to make them good bets but not all good bets will ultimately pay out this kind of large scale risk taking is part of the service we as a large company can provide to our customers and to society the good news for shareowners is that a single big winning bet can more than cover the cost of many losers development of the fire phone and echo was started around the same time while the fire phone was a failure we were able to take our learnings as well as the developers and accelerate our efforts building echo and alexa the vision for echo and alexa was inspired by the star trek computer the idea also had origins in two other arenas where wed been building and wandering for years machine learning and the cloud from amazons early days machine learning was an essential part of our product recommendations and aws gave us a front row seat to the capabilities of the cloud after many years of development echo debuted in powered by alexa who lives in the aws cloud no customer was asking for echo this was definitely us wandering market research doesnt help if you had gone to a customer in and said would you like a black always on cylinder in your kitchen about the size of a pringles can that you can talk to and ask questions that also turns on your lights and plays music i guarantee you theyd have looked at you strangely and said no thank you since that first generation echo customers have purchased more than million alexa enabled devices last year we improved alexas ability to understand requests and answer questions by more than while adding billions of facts to make alexa more knowledgeable than ever developers doubled the number of alexa skills to over and customers spoke to alexa tens of billions more times in compared to the number of devices with alexa built in more than doubled in there are now more than different products available with alexa built in from headphones and pcs to cars and smart home devices much more to come one last thing before closing as i said in the first shareholder letter more than years ago our focus is on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees who can think like owners achieving that requires investing in our employees and as with so many other things at amazon we use not just analysis but also intuition and heart to find our way forward last year we raised our minimum wage to an hour for all full time part time temporary and seasonal employees across the u s this wage hike benefitted more than amazon employees as well as over seasonal employees who worked at amazon sites across the country last holiday we strongly believe that this will benefit our business as we invest in our employees but that is not what drove the decision we had always offered competitive wages but we decided it was time to lead to offer wages that went beyond competitive we did it because it seemed like the right thing to do today i challenge our top retail competitors you know who you are to match our employee benefits and our minimum wage do it better yet go to and throw the gauntlet back at us its a kind of competition that will benefit everyone many of the other programs we have introduced for our employees came as much from the heart as the head ive mentioned before the career choice program which pays up to of tuition and fees towards a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study leading to in demand careers for our associates even if those careers take them away from amazon more than employees have now taken advantage of the program which continues to grow similarly our career skills program trains hourly associates in critical job skills like resume writing how to communicate effectively and computerbasics in october of last year in continuation of these commitments we signed the presidents pledge to americas workers and announced we will be upskilling u s employees through our range of innovative training programs our investments are not limited to our current employees or even to the present to train tomorrows workforce we have pledged million including through our recently announced amazon future engineer program to support stem and cs education around the country for elementary high school and university students with a particular focus on attracting more girls and minorities to these professions we also continue to take advantage of the incredible talents of our veterans we are well on our way to meeting our pledge to hire veterans and military spouses by and through the amazon technical veterans apprenticeship program we are providing veterans on the job training in fields like cloud computing a huge thank you to our customers for allowing us to serve you while always challenging us to do even better to our shareowners for your continuing support and to all our employees worldwide for your hard work and pioneering spirit teams all across amazon are listening to customers and wandering on their behalf as always i attach a copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
