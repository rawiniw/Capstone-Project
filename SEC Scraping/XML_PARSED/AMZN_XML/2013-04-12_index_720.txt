shareowners as regular readers of this letter will know our energy at amazon comes from the desire to impress customers rather than the zeal to best competitors we dont take a view on which of these approaches is more likely to maximize business success there are pros and cons to both and many examples of highly successful competitor focused companies we do work to pay attention to competitors and be inspired by them but it is a fact that the customer centric way is at this point a defining element of our culture one advantage perhaps a somewhat subtle one of a customer driven focus is that it aids a certain type of proactivity when were at our best we dont wait for external pressures we are internally driven to improve our services adding benefits and features before we have to we lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to we invent before we have to these investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition we think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements in customer experience importantly even in those areas where we are already the leader thank you every time i see that white paper on the front page of amazon i know that im about to get more for my money than i thought i would i signed up for prime for the shipping yet now i get movies and tv and books you keep adding more but not charging more so thanks again for the additions we now have more than million items in prime up x since we launched in prime instant video selection tripled in just over a year to more than movies and tv episodes the kindle owners lending library has also more than tripled to over books including an investment of millions of dollars to make the entire harry potter series available as part of that selection we didnt have to make these improvements in prime we did so proactively a related investment a major multi year one is fulfillment by amazon fba gives third party sellers the option of warehousing their inventory alongside ours in our fulfillment center network it has been a game changer for our seller customers because their items become eligible for prime benefits which drives their sales while at the same time benefitting consumers with additional prime selection we build automated systems that look for occasions when weve provided a customer experience that isnt up to our standards and those systems then proactively refund customers one industry observer recently received an automated email from us that said we noticed that you experienced poor video playback while watching the following rental on amazon video on demand casablanca were sorry for the inconvenience and have issued you a refund for the following amount we hope to see you again soon surprised by the proactive refund he ended up writing about the experience amazon noticed that i experienced poor video playback and they decided to give me a refund because of that wowtalk about putting customers first when you pre order something from amazon we guarantee you the lowest price offered by us between your order time and the end of the day of the release date i just received notice of a refund to my credit card for pre order price protection what a great way to do business thank you very much for your fair and honest dealings most customers are too busy themselves to monitor the price of an item after they pre order it and our policy could be to require the customer to contact us and ask for the refund doing it proactively is more expensive for us but it also surprises delights and earns trust we also have authors as customers amazon publishing has just announced it will start paying authors their royalties monthly sixty days in arrears the industry standard is twice a year and that has been the standard for a long time yet when we interview authors as customers infrequent payment is a major dissatisfier imagine how youd like it if you were paid twice a year there isnt competitive pressure to pay authors more than once every six months but were proactively doing so by the way though the research was taxing i struggled through and am happy to report that i recently saw many kindles in use at a florida beach there are five generations of kindle and i believe i saw every generation in use except for the first our business approach is to sell premium hardware at roughly breakeven prices we want to make money when people use our devices not when people buy our devices we think this aligns us better with customers for example we dont need our customers to be on the upgrade treadmill we can be very happy to see people still using four year old kindles i can keep going kindle fires freetime our customer service andon cord amazon mp s autorip but will finish up with a very clear example of internally driven motivation amazon web services in aws announced new features and services weve reduced aws prices times since launching years ago added enterprise service support enhancements and created innovative tools to help customers be more efficient aws trusted advisor monitors customer configurations compares them to known best practices and then notifies customers where opportunities exist to improve performance enhance security or save money yes we are actively telling customers theyre paying us more than they need to in the last days customers have saved millions of dollars through trusted advisor and the service is only getting started all of this progress comes in the context of aws being the widely recognized leader in its area a situation where you might worry that external motivation could fail on the other hand internal motivation the drive to get the customer to say wow keeps the pace of innovation fast our heavy investments in prime aws kindle digital media and customer experience in general strike some as too generous shareholder indifferent or even at odds with being a for profit company amazon as far as i can tell is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers writes one outside observer but i dont think so to me trying to dole out improvements in a just in time fashion would be too clever by half it would be risky in a world as fast moving as the one we all live in more fundamentally i think long term thinking squares the circle proactively delighting customers earns trust which earns more business from those customers even in new business arenas take a long term view and the interests of customers and shareholders align as i write this our recent stock performance has been positive but we constantly remind ourselves of an important point as i frequently quote famed investor benjamin graham in our employee all hands meetings in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine we dont celebrate a increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience we arent smarter when that happens and conversely arent dumber when the stock goes the other way we want to be weighed and were always working to build a heavier company as proud as i am of our progress and our inventions i know that we will make mistakes along the way some will be self inflicted some will be served up by smart and hard working competitors our passion for pioneering will drive us to explore narrow passages and unavoidably many will turn out to be blind alleys but with a bit of good fortune there will also be a few that open up into broad avenues i am incredibly lucky to be a part of this large team of outstanding missionaries who value our customers as much as i do and who demonstrate that every day with their hard work as always i attach a copy of our original letter our approach remains the same and its still day jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc april letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
