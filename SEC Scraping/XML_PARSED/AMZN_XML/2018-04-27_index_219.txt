could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment absenceofpublicmarket there is no current public market for any series of new notes and a market may not develop accordingly we cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity of any market for your new notes certain of the initial purchasers of the outstanding notes have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the new notes however they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the new notes without notice to you or us we do not intend to apply for listing of the new notes of any series on any securities exchange governing law the indenture provides that new york law shall govern any action regarding the new notes brought pursuant to the indenture table of contents risk factors participating in the exchange offer involves certain risks in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus supplement you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks before deciding whether participating in the exchange offer is suitable for you in addition you should carefully consider the other risks uncertainties and assumptions that are set forth under the caption risk factors in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march before deciding to participate in the exchange offer in addition to the foregoing risks relating to us the following are additional risks relating to the new notes and the exchange offer risks related to the new notes the new notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries the new notes are obligations exclusively of amazon com inc and not of any of our subsidiaries our operations are primarily conducted through our subsidiaries which are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due under the new notes or to make any funds available therefor whether by dividends loans or other payments except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries all claims of creditors including trade creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and therefore the claims of our creditors including holders of the new notes consequently the new notes will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish the new notes are subject to prior claims of any secured creditors and if a default occurs we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the new notes the new notes are our unsecured general obligations ranking equally with other senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding from time to time the indenture and our existing outstanding senior notes the existing notes and the agreements governing our other debt permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness including secured debt if we incur any additional secured debt our assets will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation reorganization or other winding up assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the new notes only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full holders of the new notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated creditors including holders of our existing notes and our trade creditors if we incur any additional obligations that rank equally with the new notes including trade payables the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the new notes and the existing notes in any proceeds distributed upon our insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up this may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you if there are not sufficient assets remaining to pay all of these creditors all or a portion of the new notes then outstanding would remain unpaid the limited covenants in the indenture and the terms of the new notes do not provide protection against some types of important corporate events and may not protect your investment the indenture does not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth revenues income cash flow or liquidity and accordingly does not protect holders of the new notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations table of contents restrict our subsidiaries ability to issue securities or otherwise incur indebtedness or other liabilities that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would be structurally senior to the new notes limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness that would effectively rank senior to the new notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness or to engage in sale leaseback transactions limit our ability to incur indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to the new notes restrict our ability to repurchase or prepay our securities restrict our ability to make investments or to repurchase or pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the new notes restrict our ability to enter into highly leveraged transactions or require us to repurchase the new notes in the event of a change in control as a result of the foregoing when evaluating the terms of the new notes you should be aware that the terms of the indenture and the new notes do not restrict our ability to engage in or to otherwise be a party to a variety of corporate transactions circumstances and events such as certain acquisitions refinancings or recapitalizations that could substantially and adversely affect our capital structure and the value of the new notes for these reasons you should not consider the covenants in the indenture as a significant factor in evaluating whether to invest in the new notes changes in our credit ratings may adversely affect your investment in the new notes the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt these ratings are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell the new notes inasmuch as the ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor are limited in scope and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the new notes but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued the ratings are based on information furnished to the ratings agencies by us and information obtained by the ratings agencies from other sources an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if in each rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade could affect the market value and liquidity of the new notes and increase our corporate borrowing costs there may not be active trading markets for the new notes we cannot assure you that trading markets for the new notes will ever develop or will be maintained further there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for the new notes your ability to sell your new notes or the prices at which you will be able to sell your new notes future trading prices of the new notes will depend on many factors including prevailing interest rates our financial condition and results of operations the then current ratings assigned to the new notes and the market for similar securities any trading markets that develop for the new notes would be affected by many factors independent of and in addition to the foregoing including the propensity of existing holders to trade their positions in such new notes time remaining to the maturity of such new notes outstanding amount of such new notes redemption of such new notes and level direction and volatility of market interest rates generally table of contents redemption of the new notes may adversely affect your return on such new notes we have the right to redeem all of the new notes prior to maturity we may redeem these new notes at times when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low accordingly you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of your new notes risks relating to the exchange offer you may be adversely affected if you fail to exchange outstanding notes we will issue new notes to you only if your outstanding notes are timely received by the exchange agent together with all required documents including a properly completed and signed letter of transmittal therefore you should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the outstanding notes and you should carefully follow the instructions on how to tender your outstanding notes neither we nor the exchange agent are required to tell you of any defects or irregularities with respect to your tender of the outstanding notes if you are eligible to participate in the exchange offer and do not tender your

interests in the global securities through either dtc in the united states or in europe through clearstream or through euroclear investors may hold their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems clearstream and euroclear will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers securities accounts in clearstreams and euroclears names on the books of their respective u s depositaries which in turn will hold these interests in customers securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of dtc beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in denominations of and multiples of in excess thereof except as set forth below the global securities may be transferred in whole and not in part only to another nominee of dtc or to a successor of dtc or its nominee table of contents debt securities represented by a global security can be exchanged for definitive securities in registered form only if dtc notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a successor depositary within days after receiving that notice at any time dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered or in good standing under the exchange act as amended or other applicable statute or regulation and we do not appoint a successor depositary within days after becoming aware that dtc has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency or we determine that that global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form and we notify the amazon trustee of our decision a global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for definitive securities issued in authorized denominations in registered form for the same aggregate amount the definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by dtc we will make principal and interest payments on the new notes represented by a global security to the paying agent which in turn will make payment to dtc or its nominee as the case may be as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the debt securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the amazon indenture accordingly we the amazon trustee and any paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of dtcs records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a debt security represented by a global security or any other aspect of the relationship between dtc and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants or the maintenance supervision or review of any of dtcs records relating to those beneficial ownership interests dtc has advised us that its current practice is to credit participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on dtcs records upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information the underwriters or agents for the debt securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name and will be the sole responsibility of those participants book entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note so long as dtc or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security dtc or its nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the debt securities owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in their names will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders of debt securities under the amazon indenture accordingly each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of dtc and if that person is not a dtc participant on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities the laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form these laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account we understand that under existing industry practices if we request holders to take any action or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take table of contents under the amazon indenture then dtc would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc and its participants for that global security the conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in

united states under u s law this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the united states exceeds calendar years however paragraph of the first protocol to the u s china treaty dated april allows the provisions of article to continue to apply even after the chinese student becomes a resident alien of the united states a chinese student who qualifies for this
