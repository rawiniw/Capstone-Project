hands meeting ive been reminding people that its day for a couple of decades i work in an amazon building named day and when i moved buildings i took the name with me i spend time thinking about this topic day is stasis followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating painful decline followed by death and that is why it is always day to be sure this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion an established company might harvest day for decades but the final result would still come im interested in the question how do you fend off day what are the techniques and tactics how do you keep the vitality of day even inside a large organization such a question cant have a simple answer there will be many elements multiple paths and many traps i dont know the whole answer but i may know bits of it heres a starter pack of essentials for day defense customer obsession a skeptical view of proxies the eager adoption of external trends and high velocity decision making true customer obsession there are many ways to center a business you can be competitor focused you can be product focused you can be technology focused you can be business model focused and there are more but in my view obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of day vitality why there are many advantages to a customer centric approach but heres the big one customers are always beautifully wonderfully dissatisfied even when they report being happy and business is great even when they dont yet know it customers want something better and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf no customer ever asked amazon to create the prime membership program but it sure turns out they wanted it and i could give you many such examples staying in day requires you to experiment patiently accept failures plant seeds protect saplings and double down when you see customer delight a customer obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen resist proxies as companies get larger and more complex theres a tendency to manage to proxies this comes in many shapes and sizes and its dangerous subtle and very day a common example is process as proxy good process serves you so you can serve customers but if youre not watchful the process can become the thing this can happen very easily in large organizations the process becomes the proxy for the result you want you stop looking at outcomes and just make sure youre doing the process right gulp its not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like well we followed the process a more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process the process is not the thing its always worth asking do we own the process or does the process own us in a day company you might find its the second another example market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers something thats especially dangerous when youre inventing and designing products fifty five percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature that is up from in the first survey thats hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer they spend tremendous energy developing that intuition they study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages youll find on surveys they live with the design im not against beta testing or surveys but you the product or service owner must understand the customer have a vision and love the offering then beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots a remarkable customer experience starts with heart intuition curiosity play guts taste you wont find any of it in a survey embrace external trends the outside world can push you into day if you wont or cant embrace powerful trends quickly if you fight them youre probably fighting the future embrace them and you have a tailwind these big trends are not that hard to spot they get talked and written about a lot but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace were in the middle of an obvious one right now machine learning and artificial intelligence over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder at amazon weve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now some of this work is highly visible our autonomous prime air delivery drones the amazon go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines and alexa our cloud based ai assistant we still struggle to keep echo in stock despite our best efforts a high quality problem but a problem were working on it but much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting product search ranking product and deals recommendations merchandising placements fraud detection translations and much more though less visible much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type quietly but meaningfully improving core operations inside aws were excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and ai so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques using our pre packaged versions of popular deep learning frameworks running on p compute instances optimized for this workload customers are already developing powerful systems ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop yields and weve also made amazons higher level services available in a convenient form amazon lex whats inside alexa amazon polly and amazon rekognition remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding speech generation and image analysis they can be accessed with simple api calls no machine learning expertise required watch this space much more to come high velocity decision making day companies make high quality decisions but they make high quality decisions slowly to keep the energy and dynamism of day you have to somehow make high quality high velocity decisions easy for start ups and very challenging for large organizations the senior team at amazon is determined to keep our decision making velocity high speed matters in business plus a high velocity decision making environment is more fun too we dont know all the answers but here are some thoughts first never use a one size fits all decision making process many decisions are reversible two way doors those decisions can use a light weight process for those so what if youre wrong i wrote about this in more detail in last years letter for something amusing try asking alexa what is sixty factorial second most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around of the information you wish you had if you wait for in most cases youre probably being slow plus either way you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions if youre good at course correcting being wrong may be less costly than you think whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure third use the phrase disagree and commit this phrase will save a lot of time if you have conviction on a particular direction even though theres no consensus its helpful to say look i know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it disagree and commit by the time youre at this point no one can know the answer for sure and youll probably get a quick yes this isnt one way if youre the boss you should do this too i disagree and commit all the time we recently greenlit a particular amazon studios original i told the team my view debatable whether it would be interesting enough complicated to produce the business terms arent that good and we have lots of other opportunities they had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead i wrote back right away with i disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing weve ever made consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment note what this example is not its not me thinking to myself well these guys are wrong and missing the point but this isnt worth me chasing its a genuine disagreement of opinion a candid expression of my view a chance for the team to weigh my view and a quick sincere commitment to go their way and given that this team has already brought home emmys golden globes and oscars im just glad they let me in the room at all fourth recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views they are not aligned no amount of discussion no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment without escalation the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion whoever has more stamina carries the decision ive seen many examples of sincere misalignment at amazon over the years when we decided to invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages that was a big one many smart well intentioned amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the direction the big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions many of which needed to be escalated to the senior team youve worn me down is an awful decision making process its slow and de energizing go for quick escalation instead its better so have you settled only for decision quality or are you mindful of decision velocity too are the worlds trends tailwinds for you are you falling prey to proxies or do they serve you and most important of all are you delighting customers we can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one but we have to choose it a huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you to our shareowners for your support and to amazonians everywhere for your hard work your ingenuity and your passion as always i attach a copy of our original letter it remains day sincerely jeff jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc letter to shareholders reprinted from the annual report to our shareholders amazon com passed many milestones in by year end we had served more than million customers yielding revenue growth to million and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry but this is day for the internet and if we execute well for amazon com today online commerce saves customers money and precious time tomorrow through personalization online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery amazon com uses the internet to create real value for its customers and by doing so hopes to create an enduring franchise even in established and large markets we have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers new to purchasing online are receptive to forming new relationships the competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness traffic and sales our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas we see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting this strategy is not without risk it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders its all about the long term we believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term this value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position the stronger our market leadership the more powerful our economic model market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue higher profitability greater capital velocity and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital our decisions have consistently reflected this focus we first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership customer and revenue growth the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis and the strength of our brand we have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base brand and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise because of our emphasis on the long term we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies accordingly we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision making approach so that you our shareholders may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers we will continue to make investment decisions in light of long term market leadership considerations rather than short term profitability considerations or short term wall street reactions we will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns and to step up our investment in those that work best we will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures we will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages some of these investments will pay off others will not and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case when forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our gaap accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows well take the cash flows we will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices to the extent competitive pressures allow so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long term leadership investments we will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture we understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost conscious culture particularly in a business incurring net losses we will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long term profitability and capital management at this stage we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the potential of our business model we will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash we know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an owner we arent so bold as to claim that the above is the right investment philosophy but its ours and we would be remiss if we werent clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take with this foundation we would like to turn to a review of our business focus our progress in and our outlook for the future obsess over customers from the beginning our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value we realized that the web was and still is the world wide wait therefore we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way and began serving them with books we brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store our store would now occupy football fields and presented it in a useful easy to search and easy to browse format in a store open days a year hours a day we maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience and in substantially enhanced our store we now offer customers gift certificates clicksm shopping and vastly more reviews content browsing options and recommendation features we dramatically lowered prices further increasing customer value word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make amazon com the market leader in online bookselling by many measures amazon com came a long way in sales grew from million in to million an increase cumulative customer accounts grew from to a increase the percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over in the fourth quarter of to over in the same period in in terms of audience reach per media metrix our web site went from a rank of th to within the top we established long term relationships with many important strategic partners including america online yahoo excite netscape geocities altavista home and prodigy infrastructure during we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased traffic sales and service levels amazon coms employee base grew from to and we significantly strengthened our management team distribution center capacity grew from to square feet including a expansion of our seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in delaware in november inventories rose to over titles at year end enabling us to improve availability for our customers our cash and investment balances at year end were million thanks to our initial public offering in may and our million loan affording us substantial strategic flexibility our employees the past years success is the product of a talented smart hard working group and i take great pride in being a part of this team setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been and will continue to be the single most important element of amazon coms success its not easy to work here when i interview people i tell them you can work long hard or smart but at amazon com you cant choose two out of three but we are working to build something important something that matters to our customers something that we can all tell our grandchildren about such things arent meant to be easy we are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build amazon com goals for we are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through internet commerce and merchandising our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base this requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience selection and service while we grow we are planning to add music to our product offering and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments we also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience to be certain a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business but in prioritizing our investments we now know vastly more about online commerce than when amazon com was founded but we still have so much to learn though we are optimistic we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency the challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long term vision for amazon com a reality are several aggressive capable well funded competition considerable growth challenges and execution risk the risks of product and geographic expansion and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity however as weve long said online bookselling and online commerce in general should prove to be a very large market and its likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit we feel good about what weve done and even more excited about what we want to do was indeed an incredible year we at amazon com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust to each other for our hard work and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement jeffrey p bezos founder and chief executive officer amazon com inc
