independence the board of directors believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent directors the board annually reviews all relationships that directors have with target to

directors to attend all future annual meetings of shareholders absent extraordinary circumstances board leadership structure risk oversight the board is led by mr steinhafel in his role as chairman mr steinhafel is also the chief executive officer the board also has designated a lead independent director position to complement the chairman s role and to serve as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the chairman the board recently reviewed its leadership structure and concluded that its current structure is the appropriate one for target at this time specifically the board determined that in light of target s clear strategy and the strength of its overall governance practices a combined chairman ceo role will more effectively unify the board and management around the specific initiatives to support target s strategy the board continues to separately evaluate mr steinhafel annually in each of his roles and has retained the discretion to separate the chairman ceo roles at any time if the board believes it would better serve the interests of target the board also concluded that its lead independent director position effectively balances any risk of concentration of authority that may exist with a combined chairman ceo position mr johnson functions as our lead independent director as lead director mr johnson presides at all meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present including executive sessions of non management directors conducts the annual performance reviews of the chief executive officer and

of all agenda items and has the authority to convene meetings of non management directors at every meeting the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management the board s oversight of these risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the board s oversight of our business for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the board s regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with this strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and discusses with our senior executive officers the major events activities and challenges affecting their respective functional areas the board s ongoing oversight of risk in the context of specific aspects of our business is supplemented by a formal risk review process conducted jointly by our internal audit and corporate risk teams this review employs the coso framework for classifying identified risks in four primary categories strategic operational compliance and financial and facilitates consideration of our overall risk exposures strategic objectives and risk management programs in a holistic fashion this formal risk review has been discussed with the audit committee and we intend to discuss this formal risk review with the full board on a regular basis the oversight of risks also occurs at the committee level on a more focused basis as described in the description of

interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that delivers outstanding financial results over the long term in addition to alignment with shareholders our compensation programs and principles are based on a pay for performance philosophy in which variable compensation represents a majority of potential compensation and includes a commitment to balanced performance metrics and sound governance in support of this governance commitment the company made several modifications in applying its compensation principles in in light of the uncertainty and volatility within the macroeconomic environment specifically management recommended and the board approved separate financial goals for the first half spring season and second half fall season of the year rather than establishing annual goals which had been our prior practice the adoption of financial goals at the beginning of each season which were used in determining non equity incentive compensation awards for senior executives allowed us to plan our business and execute our strategy with more timely information in a rapidly changing climatewhich has generated significant value for all shareholders over the past year additionally the compensation committee exercised discretion in the spring season by capping non equity incentive compensation payouts because of the strength of actual performance in the first half relative to expectations and the greater importance of second half results to the total year this action provided further evidence of the governance process and the commitment of the company to alignment for performance share unit psu awards granted in and we elected to use measurements of our performance relative to a defined set of competitors this was done to ensure that our performance not only exceeds our own absolute benchmarks but to ensure our compensation is linked to how we perform compared to our competition in addition to these changes an officer level compensation recoupment policy was established in january these enhancements along with our existing compensation strategy and the support of our independent compensation committee and its advisor semler brossy consulting group llc sbcg combined to create a compensation package with appropriate incentives that aligned the interests of our executives and our shareholders we achieved outstanding financial results in well above management s and the financial community s expectations for performance when the year began our fully diluted eps for was representing a increase over and within of our highest eps performance in company history the strength of these results relative to expectations is primarily due to outperformance in our retail segment which delivered record sales gross margin rate and retail earnings before interest and taxes ebit the results of our credit card segment were in line with our expectations for the year and well above most other credit card issuers reflecting disciplined portfolio management in a challenging credit environment overall our performance is the result of an unwavering adherence to our strategic priorities a thoughtful approach to planning and execution and gradually improving economic conditions as a result of these exceptional results our executive officers received non equity incentive compensation that exceeded goal amounts in alignment with our pay for performance strategy in broad terms our compensation programs for executive officers reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we establish incentive plan payout levels to provide an opportunity for compensation payments well above median levels in the marketplace when financial performance goals are exceeded and our stock price increases and for significantly reduced compensation when our financial performance is below expectations and our stock price decreases incorporate a mix of cash and equity compensation elements with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance this approach aligns with shareholder interests and is not overly influenced by a single financial measure or timeframe and encourages appropriate risk taking provide a competitive package of long term time vested equity compensation retirement and benefit plans to facilitate retention and provide opportunities to realize future value and offer limited perquisites to promote efficiency in conducting company business and assist in the health and safety of our executive officers the specific objectives of our variable compensation programs are to focus attention on key financial performance measures that correlate with the creation of shareholder value including market share earnings per share eps earnings before interest and taxes ebit and economic value added eva directly align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by linking long term compensation to stock price performance and allow actual compensation to incorporate variability inherent in individual subjective performance assessments roles of compensation committee management and consultants the compensation committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of our non ceo executive officer pay packages and for developing a recommendation for the ceo s pay package that is reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full board the committee receives assistance from two sources its independent compensation consulting firm sbcg and our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president of human resources sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target specifically the committee has asked sbcg to regularly provide independent advice on current trends in compensation design including overall levels of compensation the merits of using particular forms of compensation the relative weightings of different compensation elements and the value of particular performance measures on which to base compensation within this framework sbcg has been instructed to work collaboratively with management including our ceo our executive vice president of human resources and her staff to gain an understanding of target s business and compensation programs to help sbcg advise the committee compensation recommendations for executive officers are made to the committee in two separate ways with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the committee s consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies on its understanding of target s business and compensation programs and sbcg s independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with the ceo with respect to his compensation for other executive officers the executive vice president of human resources works with the ceo to develop the ceo s compensation recommendations to the committee in developing these recommendations the executive vice president of human resources provides the ceo with market data on pay levels and compensation design practices provided by hewitt associates llc hewitt covering the benchmark companies noted in the next section hewitt does not have any interaction with either the committee or the ceo but does interact with the executive vice president of human resources and her staff in addition to providing market data hewitt performs other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation the final recommendations to the committee are determined by the ceo and include a recommendation with respect to the compensation of the executive vice president of human resources importantly sbcg provides the committee with sbcg s independent view of the ceo s compensation recommendations all decisions regarding executive compensation and final recommendations to the independent members of the full board are made solely by the committee compensation positioning competitive benchmarking specific compensation levels for each executive officer are evaluated annually relative to benchmark companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data obtained from publicly available proxy statements analyzed by sbcg and proprietary survey data assembled by hewitt the companies included in the market comparisons are listed below retail group general industry group best buy lowe s m

provides a cross section of general merchandise department store food and specialty retailers and includes companies that are large generally exceeding billion in revenues and meaningful competitors general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and among the leaders in their industries all of our peers are among the top fortune ranked companies and the median annualized total return to shareholders for both groups has outperformed the sp over the past five years ended january the composition of the peer groups is reviewed annually to ensure it is relevant and comprehensive and any changes made are reviewed with sbcg and approved by the compensation committee the committee regularly reviews the financial performance of our retail peers as it provides a useful benchmark of companies generating profitable market share growth over time for two changes were made anheuser busch was acquired by the european company inbev and was replaced in the general industry group by kraft foods and data from wells fargo was withheld because they were subject to tarp legislation that impacted compensation benchmarking elements and amounts for each executive officer position market data from our benchmark companies is used to compare program design and establish a targeted level of total direct compensation which is the sum of base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation because we believe executive compensation should be highly correlated with our financial performance and the creation of shareholder value variable elements of compensation particularly long term equity based awards comprise a majority of total direct compensation for performance at goal over of each executive officer s total direct compensation at goal is at risk and aligned with stock price and or company financial performance the following section outlines the elements of compensation at goal for our named executive officers element description base salary comprises or less of an executive officer s total direct compensation for performance at goal for the ceo it generally comprises or less an executive officer s base salary is based on the size and scope of his or her position individual expertise experience and performance the company typically targets base salary for all executive officers near the thpercentile of the retail peer group and the thpercentile of the general industry peer group this positioning is reflective of the scope and complexity of our business relative to our peer group and positions us appropriately in the competitive market for talent short term incentive sti annual total short term incentive opportunity which includes non equity incentive plan and personal performance payments generally comprises or less of an executive officer s total direct compensation for performance at goal for the ceo it generally comprises or less at goal performance the non equity incentive plan comprises two thirds of the total short term incentive and personal performance accounts for one third non equity incentive plan payouts are based on performance of actual ebit and eva versus separate goals set for spring season and fall season performance versus spring season

discretionary and based on subjective individual performance factors long term incentive lti comprises at least of total direct compensation for performance at goal for both the ceo and executive officers lti awards are granted in the form of stock options psus and restricted stock units rsus balancing awards tied to stock price performance and those tied to the combination of financial and stock price performance this mix also facilitates retention and is consistent with our compensation philosophy and peer group market practice of the lti award value as of the grant date is delivered as stock options as psus and as rsus psu awards are based on domestic net sales market share growth and on eps performance both are measured relative to our retail peer group over a year period total direct compensation at goal the above elements aim to deliver total direct compensation that is at the thpercentile of the retail peer group and at the thpercentile of the general industry peer group this positioning is reflective of the scope and complexity of our business relative to our peer group and positions us appropriately in the competitive market for talent compensation actions table we have included a table outlining compensation decisions made in connection with the fiscal year for the named executive officers that differs from the fiscal summary compensation table on page in the following ways it reflects determinations made by our compensation committee based on our annual grant cycle that includes equity awards granted in different fiscal years the annual grant cycle involves a determination of the value of all long term incentive awards in january of each year stock options and rsus are granted in january and psus are granted two months later in march to align with our financial goal setting process in march the board made a restricted stock grant to the ceo which was related to his annual incentive compensation as discussed in more detail below name year

assumptions that differ from the assumptions used in the hewitt black scholes methodology used to determine the size of the stock option grants the compensation shown in the above table reflects the design discussed on the previous page together with our above goal actual performance as discussed below in key performance measures and performance goals it also reflects the amount and form of the annual incentive compensation for our ceo mr steinhafel in determining the ceo s annual incentive the compensation committee and board considered our performance in absolute terms relative to our retail and general industry peers and information provided by the board s independent compensation consultant regarding market levels for ceo total direct compensation in light of our outstanding performance that delivered financial results significantly above goal mr steinhafel earned million under the terms of our annual non equity incentive plan this amount was determined formulaically and reflects that we significantly exceeded our ebit and eva goals during our two semi annual measurement periods as discussed below in key performance measures and performance goals in addition the board awarded mr steinhafel a discretionary amount of million to recognize his personal performance both as chief executive officer in leading the company and as chairman of the board in leading the governance of the company in resulting in aggregate annual incentive compensation of million to ensure continued alignment of ceo compensation between short term results and longer term value creation the board awarded the aggregate million in annual incentive compensation in a combination of cash and stock by exercising its discretion to reduce the cash payment of million that was determined under our non equity incentive plan to million and granted mr steinhafel a million restricted stock award because of this split of mr steinhafel s incentive compensation between cash and stock the restricted stock award is reflected in the stock awards column above and no amount is shown as a cash based personal performance payment key performance measures and performance goals our incentive programs use a combination of revenue profit and return on investment metrics with semi annual annual three year and longer time horizons to provide a balanced assessment of our performance over time and ensure that our compensation performance metrics support our financial and strategic objectives the combination of base salary short term incentive and long term incentive pay mix is designed to encourage thoughtful but not excessive risk taking for each performance measure we set a goal level of performance that is approved in advance by our compensation committee and independent directors and takes into consideration the financial performance of our peer companies actual performance against these goals determines the amount if any of payments to executive officers under our variable compensation plans the following section describes the performance measures used under our short term and long term incentive compensation plans in the financial or strategic objective they are intended to reinforce and the variable compensation element s with which they are aligned variable short term cash based incentive measures non equity incentive plan ebitone of two financial performance measures for payments under our annual non equity incentive plan this measurement is designed to reinforce our focus on the growth in our earnings before interest and taxes and accounts for of the non equity incentive plan payout because the majority of our credit card receivables portfolio earns interest based on a variable interest rate changes in interest rates affect finance charge revenues that in turn affect reported ebit accordingly we adjust ebit to generally eliminate the effect of interest rate fluctuations either up or down on incentive plan calculations investment discipline eva eva is the other financial performance measure for payments under our annual non equity incentive plan and accounts as the other of the plan payout eva is a measure of earnings after an estimated after tax cost of capital charge and is used to evaluate the degree to which capital is being efficiently invested the effective tax rate used to calculate eva is fixed to prevent future tax volatility from having an unintended effect on payments a positive eva performance indicates we are generating returns on invested capital at rates higher than the cost of capital among other things our use of eva helps us temper the objective of increasing revenues through new store construction with a measure of how profitably we are investing in new stores in calculating eva we use an annualized after tax blended cost of debt and equity capital of for capital used to fund our core retail operations and approximately for capital used to fund our credit card operations variable short term cash based incentive actual results non equity incentive plan and personal performance ebit and eva performance resultsstrong execution in both business segments combined with improving economic trends led to exceptional ebit and eva performance in spring season results account for of non equity incentive compensation due to the strength of actual spring performance relative to goal and the greater importance of second half results the compensation committee capped spring season payouts fall season results account for of non equity incentive compensation financial results continued to excel during the fall season with actual results again above expectations because of these exceptional results in both seasons our executive officers earned annual non equity incentive compensation

personal performanceall executive officers are eligible to earn a personal performance payment for all executive officers other than the ceo personal performance payments correspond to a predetermined percentage of their base salary tied to a payout matrix for each personal performance review score the maximum personal performance payout is equal to of an executive officer s base salary review scores are approved by the compensation committee and are discretionary based on subjective management criteria including the executive officer s ability to develop a high performance team their ability to lead strategic initiatives and their demonstration of a strong commitment to high ethical standards we include this subjective element within our mix of variable compensation elements to recognize the critical factors upon which we believe performance should be judged but which are not quantifiable or linked to our financial statements for fiscal the compensation committee approved the ceo s recommended personal review scores for executives variable long term equity based incentive measures and actual results option awards and stock awards stock pricewe believe consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in our stock price stock options psus and rsus are the vehicles we use to provide our executive officers with a stake in this potential reward of their efforts the actual compensation realized from stock options is dependent on increases in our stock price after the option grant dates and on each executive officer s decision of when to exercise the value of psu and rsu awards is also dependent on our stock price performance over time long term equity incentive plan performance years prior to payouts of psus granted prior

benchmarks but also performance relative to that of our competitors absolute measures that were used in the past could be greatly skewed by a rapid downturn or upturn in the economy rather than reflecting executives ability to drive performance under those conditions the following table summarizes the performance and results that determine psu payouts using the new measurements long term

in january the board of directors approved a recoupment policy for all officers at target specifically the recoupment or clawback allows for recovery of the following compensation elements all amounts paid under the short term incentive plan includes discretionary component that were paid with respect to any fiscal year that is restated all awards under the long term incentive plan whether exercised vested unvested or deferred all demands for repayment are subject to compensation committee discretion for an officer to be subject to recovery or cancellation under this policy he or she must have engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the need for a restatement of our consolidated financial statements policies on equity compensation general our use of equity compensation is intended to enhance the alignment of executive and shareholder interests and also to provide a means for our executives and directors to accumulate an ownership stake in target our executive and director stock ownership guidelines and their current ownership positions are discussed on pages of this proxy statement our compensation committee recognizes that the use of equity as a form of compensation can result in potential shareholder dilution all of our equity compensation awards are granted under a shareholder approved plan our long term incentive plan on an annual basis the committee reviews and approves an aggregate pool of shares that are available for grant and in doing so reviews metrics relating to both the annual grant rate and the cumulative dilutive impact of outstanding awards in addition the plan expressly prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option without shareholder approval grant timing policy we have the following practices regarding the timing of equity compensation grants which includes stock option exercise price determinations these practices have not been formalized in a written policy but they are strictly observed stock options and rsus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled january compensation committee meeting psus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled march compensation committee meeting in order to align the grant date of the award with our financial goal setting process these meetings are scheduled more than one year in advance we set the exercise price of stock awards at the volume weighted average trading price of our stock on the grant date we believe that the volume weighted average price is a better measure of the fair value of our shares than the closing price on the grant date as it eliminates the effect of any variations in stock price that may occur in the final minutes of trading if the closing price were used we have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around our grant dates our information releases are handled in a process completely separate from our equity grants on occasion we make equity compensation grants outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires promotions and recognition or retention purposes grants to executive officers are approved by the compensation committee with an effective date on or after the date of approval if the grant date is after the date of approval it is on a date specified by the committee at the time of approval additional compensation elements several of our compensation elements are designed to encourage retention of key talent these elements include stock options rsus psus pension plan k and deferred compensation plan details on each of these elements of our compensation programs are provided in the tables that follow the summary compensation table beginning on page perquisites we provide certain perquisites to our executive officers principally to allow them to devote more time to company business and to promote their health and safety the compensation committee reviews these perquisites annually to ensure they are consistent with our

the same assumptions and valuation dates used for the valuation of pension plan liabilities in our financial statements participants can elect other annuity forms that have an actuarially equivalent value we do not grant extra years of service to supplement retirement benefits the pension plan allows for early retirement payments to commence at age subject to a benefit reduction for termination of employment before age and a separate reduction for commencing a benefit before age a participant who terminates employment before age has his or her vested benefit calculated based on the final average monthly pay as of their termination date but service is projected to age the vested benefit is then multiplied by the ratio of the participant s actual completed service to their projected

per year between age and age based upon the participant s age when benefits commence the target corporation supplemental pension plan i spp i restores the lost qualified pension plan benefit due to an

lump sum amount is calculated and added to or deducted from the participant s edcp account this same calculation and an edcp account adjustment also occurs upon termination of employment to determine the amount of the change in actuarial equivalent lump sum amount the prior transfers are adjusted by an assumed annual earnings rate based on the rate of return of the stable value fund crediting rate alternative in edcp actuarial equivalents are determined using the discount methodology we use in calculating lump sum payments under the pension plan currently we use the applicable interest rate and

shareholder approval of three proposals to amend our restated articles of incorporation the following summary of the proposed amendments may not contain all the information that is important to you the complete text of proposed amended and restated articles reflecting the amendments proposed in items and is set forth in appendixa this summary is qualified in its entirety to the text of the proposed amended and restated articles in appendixa which you are urged to read in its entirety item threeapproval of amendment to our restated articles relating to our board of directors including to provide for annual elections of all directors the board is currently classified which means it is divided into three classes and members of each class are elected to serve for staggered three year terms proponents of classified boards believe that they provide continuity and stability to the board facilitate a long term outlook by the board and improve the board s negotiating position when confronted with an unsolicited suitor on the other hand an increasing number of investors have come to believe that classified boards reduce accountability of directors because they limit the ability of shareholders to evaluate and elect all directors annually the board is committed to good corporate governance in making its recommendation the board considered carefully comments from our shareholders regarding the advantages of both classified and declassified board structures the board determined that the advantages of a classified board were outweighed by the advantages of the shareholders ability to evaluate all directors annually and the adoption of a structure that is currently considered by many to be a best practice in corporate governance consequently the board concluded that an amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to provide for the annual election of all directors is in the best interests of target and its shareholders if the proposed amendment to declassify the board is approved by the shareholders at this annual meeting the declassified board structure would be phased in as follows the classi directors elected at this annual meeting will be elected for a one year term the classii directors will continue to serve the remainder of their elected terms which expire at the annual meeting the classiii directors whose terms are scheduled to expire at the annual meeting have all submitted a resignation conditioned on the approval of this item such that they will serve only one year of their remaining term but would be eligible to stand for election at the annual meeting and starting with the annual meeting all directors will be elected annually articlevi also contains a requirement that a shareholder must provide the board with at least days notice prior to the date of the annual shareholders meeting of any candidates the shareholder intends to nominate for election as a director at the annual meeting of shareholders item would eliminate this provision from our articles of incorporation the board has already approved an amendment to our bylaws to add an advance notice provision for director nominations this bylaw provision will take effect if this amendment to the articles is approved and it requires that advance notice of director nominations must be given at least days prior to the first anniversary date of the prior year s annual meeting of shareholders however if the date of the annual meeting is more than days before or days after the first anniversary date of the prior year s annual meeting of shareholders advance notice of director nominations must be given by the later of at least days prior to the date of the annual meeting or within days following the first public announcement of the annual meeting date the bylaw provision also requires additional disclosures regarding the nominating shareholder and the shareholder s proposed nominees the board reviewed the prevailing practices of other large companies with respect to advance notice provisions and concluded that the day notice and additional disclosure requirements are consistent with the practices of many of those companies and also reasonable requirements to impose on nominating shareholders currently articlevi also sets forth a complicated method for determining the size of the board under articlevi of our current restated articles of incorporation t he number of directors may be increased by the shareholders or board of directors or decreased by the shareholders from the number of directors on the board of directors immediately prior to the effective date of this articlevi provided however that any change in the number of directors on the board of directors including without limitation changes at annual meetings of shareholders shall be approved by the affirmative vote of not less than seventy five percent of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding shares of voting stock as defined in articleiv voting together as a single class unless such change shall have been approved by a majority of the entire board of directors if such change shall not have been so approved the number of directors shall remain the same this provision has in the past created ambiguity regarding the size of the board particularly in the event of mid term director resignations the proposed amendment to articlevi provides that both the directors and the shareholders have the power to set the size of the board regardless of i whether the size set is an increase or a decrease from the number of directors then serving on the board ii the number of directors serving immediately prior to the effective date of articlevi iii the number elected at the previous year s meeting or iv the number serving prior to or after a death or resignation the effect of the amendment would be that our shareholders would know at the time when our annual proxy statement is filed each year the exact number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting unless there is a shareholder proposal to change the number of directors without amendment the current restated articles might be interpreted to require the board to solicit shareholder approval each time it wanted to maintain the size of the board following a director s resignation or death we believe that the need for clarification is heightened when all our directors are elected each year our current restated articles of incorporation require the approval of at least of the outstanding stock entitled to vote in order to remove any member of the board or to amend or repeal any provision of articlevi the supermajority vote requirement was designed to protect against circumvention of the staggered three year terms under the classified board structure and to promote the benefits to target and its shareholders provided by that structure once the board is declassified there is no longer a strong reason for this protection a similar rationale underlies the proposed deletion of the supermajority requirement to amend articlevi itself the amendment to articlevi would not alter the current requirement that shareholder initiated changes in the size of the board must be approved by holders of of the voting shares unless approved by the board any future amendment to that requirement would require the vote of of the voting power of the outstanding stock under the statutory requirements of the minnesota business corporation act mbca approval of this amendment will amend articlevi as shown on appendixa and will require the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock if the proposed amendment is not approved the board of directors will remain classified and the other proposed changes to articlevi will not be adopted the board recommends that shareholders vote for item item fourapproval of amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to eliminate supermajority voting requirement for certain business combinations articleiv of our restated articles requires that certain business combinations as defined in the current restated articles of incorporation involving or proposed by a shareholder owning at least of our outstanding voting shares receive the approval of at least of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on the transaction unless certain conditions are met including approval by a majority of those persons who are continuing directors as defined in the current restated articles of incorporation or satisfaction of certain price and procedure requirements set forth in articleiv item is a proposal to delete articleiv in its entirety under the current provisions of the mbca an interested shareholder defined generally as a shareholder owning at least of the outstanding voting shares cannot enter into a business combination defined generally to include the same or similar transactions as those described in the definition of business combination in our current restated articles of incorporation with target for years after becoming an interested shareholder unless prior to the transaction by which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder a committee composed solely of one or more disinterested directors defined generally as a director who has not been an officer or employee of target or a related organization during the preceding years or if there are no such disinterested directors by a committee of or more disinterested persons who are not directors approves either the business combination or the transaction by which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder articleiv of our current restated articles of incorporation was adopted before the enactment of the current mbca provisions regarding business combinations with interested shareholders the board believes that the supermajority shareholder approval required in articleiv of our current restated articles of incorporation is similar in purpose to the approval requirements set forth in the mbca as described above and that the supermajority requirement is therefore no longer necessary or desirable the board has thus concluded that it is in the best interests of target and its shareholders to eliminate current articleiv of our restated articles of incorporation in its entirety in the event we are involved in a transaction that constitutes a business combination under the mbca the provisions of the statute would govern approval of this amendment will cause articleiv of our current restated articles of incorporation to be deleted in its entirety as set forth on appendixa and it will require the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock the board recommends that shareholders vote for item item fiveapproval of the amendment and restatement of our restated articles of incorporation in addition to the proposed amendments to our restated articles of incorporation described in items and the board recommends shareholder approval of a proposal to amend and restate our restated articles of incorporation to integrate all amendments approved by shareholders at the annual meeting into one document to conform cross references in current articlesv and vii and to update a statutory reference in current articlev for a change in the mbca none of the proposed amendments in this item would change our authorized capital stock indemnification of officers and directors or limitation of liability provisions and none of the amendments would adversely affect the rights or preferences of our shareholders this amendment and restatement will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the holders of our common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on this item at the annual meeting if any of items and is not approved then the amendments reflected by that item will not be made and our restated articles of incorporation will retain the current provisions governing the subject matter of that item the board recommends that shareholders vote for item item sixshareholder proposal regarding annual advisory vote on executive compensation allen edward hancock trustee of allen edward hancock revocable living trust alder street eugene oregon who held shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that the shareholders of target corporation request the board of directors to adopt a policy that provides shareholders the opportunity at each annual shareholder meeting to vote on an advisory resolution proposed by management to ratify the compensation of the named executive officers neos set forth in the proxy statement s summary compensation table the sct and the accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the sct but not the compensation discussion and analysis the proposal submitted to shareholders should make clear that the vote is non binding and would not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any neo supporting statement in our view senior executive compensation at target has not always been structured in ways that best serve shareholders interests while shareholders were experiencing negative total shareholder return for ceo gregg w steinhafel received over million in reported total compensation which is roughly times the average pay of production workers in the general merchandise stores industry in shareholders filed close to say on pay resolutions votes on these resolutions averaged more than in favor and more than companies had votes over demonstrating strong shareholder support for this reform investor public and legislative concerns about executive compensation have reached new levels of intensity a report by the conference board task force on executive compensation noting that pay has become a flashpoint recommends taking immediate and credible action in order to restore trust in the ability of boards to oversee executive compensation and calls for compensation programs which are transparent understandable and effectively communicated to shareholders an advisory vote establishes an annual referendum process for shareholders about senior executive compensation we believe this vote would provide our board and management useful information about shareholder views on the company s senior executive compensation especially when tied to an innovative investor communication program over companies have agreed to an advisory vote including apple ingersoll rand microsoft occidental petroleum hewlett packard intel verizon mbia and pge and nearly tarp participants implemented the advisory vote in providing an opportunity to see it in action riskmetrics group recommends votes in favor noting riskmetrics encourages companies to allow shareholders to express their opinions of executive compensation practices by establishing an annual referendum process an advisory vote on executive compensation is another step forward in enhancing board accountability we believe existing sec rules and stock exchange listing standards do not provide shareholders with sufficient mechanisms for providing input to boards on senior executive compensation we believe voting against the election of board members to send a message about executive compensation is a blunt sledgehammer approach whereas an advisory vote provides shareholders a more effective instrument we believe that a company that has a clearly explained compensation philosophy and metrics reasonably links pay to performance and communicates effectively to investors would find a management sponsored advisory vote a helpful tool we urge shareholders to vote for this resolution position of the board of directors the board has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders for the following reasons the say on pay issue is currently being considered by congress and has been characterized as a priority that may be finalized in in addition current practice and comments by policymakers around the specifics of implementing say on pay policies are not uniform as a result the precise form and frequency of a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation that is likely to be mandated by law is subject to some uncertainty in light of the prospects for federal legislation on this topic the board believes the best course of action is to wait for congress to clarify this issue rather than adopting a form of advisory vote policy that may be inconsistent with a standard that may be specified in the near future the board continues to be open to input from shareholders regarding their specific concerns and suggestions on target s executive compensation programs as discussed under communications with directors on page of this proxy statement shareholders can write any member of the board and express their views we received this same proposal at our annual meeting of shareholders and holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy voted against the proposal the board recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to require an
