sharing arrangement with td bank group net of servicing expenses in prior periods credit card revenues net of credit card expenses from the historical u s credit card segment have been classified within u s segment sga expenses in addition beginning with fiscal target made changes to certain vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of marketing programs as a result these payments are being recorded as a reduction to u s segment cost of sales rather than a reduction to sga expenses creating equivalent year over year increases in both gross margin and sga expense rates this change has no effect on u s segment ebitda and ebit margin rates first quarter ebitda margin rate was percent compared with percent in the revised u s segment and percent in the historical u s
