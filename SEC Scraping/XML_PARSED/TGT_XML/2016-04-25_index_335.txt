net sales for us and our retail peer group a the companys domestic net sales in the baseline year is divided by the markets domestic net sales for the baseline year b the companys domestic net sales

grow it profitably and to ensure prudent deployment of capital to drive the business as described on page we sold our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs in december of the change in market share and eps growth metrics described above will use fiscal as the baseline year from which we will compare our performance with our retail peer group over the next three years to normalize our results for

our current deferred compensation plan and therefore not considered for benefit purposes under the pension plan or spp i each year the annual change in the actuarial lump sum amount of a participant vested benefits under spp i and ii is calculated and added to or deducted from the participants edcp account this same calculation and an edcp account adjustment also occurs upon termination of

prior transfers adjusted by an assumed annual earnings rate based on a conservative investment of the prior transfers for the final average pay benefit actuarial equivalents are determined using the discount methodology we use in calculating lump sum payments under the pension plan currently we use the applicable interest rate and mortality factors under irc section e published in the month of transfer for active officers and in the month prior to the month of termination for terminated officers because of the feature that annually transfers amounts to a participants edcp account the benefits accrued under spp i and ii are reflected as edcp deferrals in the nonqualified deferred compensation table if the current actuarial equivalent lump sum value of the spp benefit is less than

election will not be considered as having been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors any person or group acquires or more of our common stock we merge with or into another company and our shareholders own less than of the combined company or our shareholders approve an agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve our company our plans do not provide for any gross ups for taxes due on any payments described in this section without termination of employment the consequence of a change in control to the neos without termination of employment is generally as follows the deferred compensation balance in the edcp will be paid in a lump sum as soon as allowed under irc section a unless the board of directors determines not to accelerate payment of these amounts and a double trigger applies to pbrsus or psu awards meaning that no vesting will accelerate upon a change in control unless an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a voluntary termination of

neos employment terminates involuntarily without cause or voluntarily with good reason a material reduction in compensation or responsibilities or a required relocation following a change in control following a change in control the double trigger requirement will be met and the post termination benefits that may be received generally consist of severance payments under our icp accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options and for outstanding pbrsus and psus the greater of a the amount the recipient would have been entitled to had the termination occurred without a change in control

performance period that has elapsed as of the date of the termination following the change in control the balance of the awards is forfeited we use the greater of calculation for pbrsus and psus to prevent a neo from receiving less due to a change in control than they would have received as a result of a similar termination absent a change in control in addition we use the at goal payout for

in its review and report the company might also consider a congruency analysis between its stated corporate values and company operations in certain regions which raises an issue of misalignment with those corporate values and stating the justification for such exceptions for example the company recently joined with other corporations in bashing american states that support traditional marriage in a u s supreme court filing the company joined a brief that suggested states with traditional view on marriage hamper employer efforts to recruit and retain the most talented workforce possible in those states however target has operations in regions such as india and pakistan where homosexual acts are criminalized these company operations are inconsistent with targets claimed values additionally target supports sustainability and works to reduce its co ghg emissions however target has operations in china the worlds largest emitter of co with a questionable record on human rights and religious freedom again operations in this region appear to conflict with targets stated values and policies the proponent believes that targets record to date demonstrates a gap between its lofty rhetoric aspirations and its performance the requested report would play a role in illuminating and addressing the factors accounting for this gap position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders our selection of the countries in which we operate is based on a wide range of proprietary factors relating to our business strategy including social and environmental related risks we apply our values and standards of conduct everywhere we do business in evaluating our supply chain we aspire to the highest ethical and legal standards and we only work with vendors and suppliers who share our commitment to advance those standards we work with manufacturers industry organizations and other retailers around the world to continually raise the bar for our industry as a whole proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents respect for human rights is a fundamental principle throughout our business practices and standards we require all vendors including manufacturers contractors subcontractors and suppliers to meet our standards of vendor engagement which address eleven business principles focused on ethical sourcing see https corporate target com corporate responsibility responsible sourcing for additional detail our standards often exceed requirements set by local law to drive accountability throughout our supply chain for these standards we consistently monitor our vendors to confirm that our standards are being met in we conducted over supply chain audits on human rights labor health and safety in different countries more information about our audit program is available at https corporate target com corporate responsibility in addition we believe that implementing this proposal would not be a productive use of company resources and that doing so would not provide meaningful information to shareholders if the requested report were undertaken it would omit proprietary information and not materially enhance targets existing publicly available information relating to our commitment to human rights for these reasons we do not believe that this proposal is in the best interests of target or our shareholders the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to
