invest in opportunities to grow our business profitably create sustainable long term value and maintain our current operations and assets annual dividend maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually share repurchase return excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals dividend and share repurchase philosophy our business generates more cash than we currently need to fully invest in the growth and long term health of our business so we return excess cash to shareholders through an appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase we believe that both dividends and share repurchases serve important purposes we believe that our dividend should be competitive reliable and sustainable we also believe that share repurchase is the most effective way to return any excess cash to shareholders after we have met our other priorities of fully investing in our business and maintaining a competitive dividend because it allows shareholders to redeploy the cash as they choose while providing us with appropriate flexibility to respond to changes in our operating performance and investment opportunities for example we suspended all share repurchase activity for a period from the middle of through early in response to changes in our operating performance but we continued to invest in our business

legal officer corporate secretary our cda is divided into the following sections executive summary our performance framework for executive compensation other benefit elements compensation governance target corporation proxy statement back to contents executive summary guiding principles of our compensation program we believe executive compensation should be directly linked to performance and the creation of long term value for our shareholders with that in mind the three guiding principles of our compensation program are to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace provide a framework that encourages outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term deliver on our pay for performance philosophy in support of our strategy a significant portion of our executive compensation is at risk and therefore may vary from targeted compensation based upon the level of achievement of specified performance objectives and stock price performance shareholder support for our advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder outreach program at our june annual meeting of shareholders shareholders approved our say on pay proposal in support of our executive compensation program by consistent with the fiscal vote of we believe open dialogue with our shareholders and incorporation of their feedback into our executive compensation program has been instrumental in obtaining shareholder support for our compensation programs design and direction we regularly engage in outreach efforts with our shareholders relating to a variety of topics and involve one or more independent directors in these conversations as appropriate we use the information gathered through these outreach efforts to help inform our compensation decisions we look forward to continued dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business summary of key compensation decisions made in fiscal topic description more information financial component of stip based on below threshold performance for fiscal the financial component of our short term incentive plan stip had a zero payout therefore our ceo did not receive a stip payout for the year team scorecard component of stip beginning in fiscal and to replace the personal performance component of the non ceo neos stip we introduced the team scorecard the scorecard was designed to strongly align non ceo neo pay opportunity to our strategy focusing on certain key initiatives believed to ensure a foundation for future growth strategic alignment award payout strategic alignment awards were granted in to connect the management teams pay with performance in achieving goals designed to reposition target and drive long term growth consistent with our key priorities payout of these awards was based on important absolute metrics each selected to drive focused outcomes that complement the relative performance metrics in our annual long term incentive lti awards neo new hire compensation as part of the offers given to mr tritton and mr liu to join target the human resources compensation committee approved sign on bonuses make whole rsus and pro rata equity grants consisting of psus and pbrsus for context to understand the key compensation decisions made in fiscal it is also important to understand a compensation decision that took place after the end of fiscal at our february financial community meeting we announced that target is aggressively accelerating investments in its strategic initiatives including an expected capital investment of over billion in fiscal and over billion expected in the next three years principally in store remodels new small format stores and digital and supply chain capabilities and a planned billion investment in operating margin in fiscal to enhance the digital and in store experience of our guests these investments which are intended to position target for sustained and profitable sales growth and market share gains in the long term may result in lower near term profitability that could negatively affect outstanding lti awards granted before the decision to make those investments accordingly with the perspective of this extensive long term investment plan in april the board decided to grant price vested stock options price vested options to maintain continuity of the executive team throughout this investment period galvanize them around the key initiatives and reward success in this transformational effort the price vested options serve as a supplemental compensation element based exclusively on stock price performance to complement outstanding lti awards through the investment period announced in february the price vested options have an effective grant date of may the first trading day that begins after hours following our first quarter earnings release and the exercise price will be equal to the fair market value on the effective grant date the key design features of the price vested options align managements interests with shareholders target corporation proxy statement back to contents vesting is based on both time and stock price criteria the price vested options are not exercisable during the first three years and will become exercisable only if targets stock price exceeds a hurdle of for consecutive trading days within the seven year term of the options the stock price criteria are challenging the performance hurdle of maintained for a period of days is challenging both in terms of historic stock price levels and in relation to our more recent share price following the february announcement the price hurdle represents a premium over our closing price of on april the date the awards were approved the price hurdle is also well above our average price for the period between the february announcement and approval date which was the consecutive day requirement helps to mitigate temporary stock price fluctuations from influencing potential gains finally at any time prior to the effective grant date the board can decide not to issue the price vested options if it determines that unexpected circumstances have arisen which undermine the purpose of the price vested options such as the stock price criteria becoming no longer sufficiently challenging mandatory post exercise holding period the shares received upon exercise net of exercise costs and taxes are subject to a one year post exercise holding period even if this period extends beyond termination of employment during the post exercise holding period the shares received upon exercise may not be used by the executive in satisfying our stock ownership guidelines strict forfeiture provisions for voluntary terminations price vested options are completely forfeited if the executive leaves within the first three years no retirement based extensions notably and in contrast to the terms of our annual lti awards there are no retirement based extensions of vesting or exercisability for these price vested options relationship to other compensation elements of our annual lti grant features performance based metrics that measure our performance relative to our peers in addition our outstanding psus feature an eps growth metric which was affected by the february announcement to aggressively accelerate investments the committee believes the price vested options provide a market based complement to the relative performance measures of the other outstanding compensation elements through the investment period announced in february as a result of these actions mr cornell and each of the other neos would receive price vested options with effective grant date fair values of million and million respectively the grant date present value of the price vested options was considered in relation to the most recently completed fiscal year with the grant representing approximately of ceos annual lti grant for fiscal because these awards were not granted in fiscal they will be reflected in the summary compensation table for fiscal pay for performance we provide our neos a mix of base salary short term and long term incentives with compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our near term and long term strategic goals our short term incentives are based on annual absolute financial goals and progress made toward key strategic priorities of our lti program features performance based metrics and is tied to relative performance versus our retail peers over a three year time period the charts below illustrate close alignment of executive compensation and our performance the charts show actual payouts as a percentage of goal over the last five years for our

non ceo neos as disclosed in prior proxy statements psus spanning the and performance periods and stip payouts were forfeited for active executive officers including current neos mr cornell and mr mulligan when we did not meet the minimum performance condition under m for fiscal due to the discontinuation of canadian operations if the awards were not forfeited the financial results versus our

team scorecard payout of of base salary for our non ceo neos target corporation proxy statement back to contents long term incentives to align our executive officers pay outcomes with long term performance of our annual lti grant features performance based metrics and comprises the majority of each neos total compensation value of lti awarded at grant in determining the amount of individual lti awards the human resources compensation committee considered each neos performance during the fiscal year potential future contributions historical annual grant amounts and retention considerations as well as market data for comparable executives from our retail and general industry peer groups the annual lti grants for our neos are made in january of each year the last month of our fiscal year to allow the committee to include an assessment of our financial performance in determining grant levels the human resources compensation committee made no changes to the neos annual lti grants versus the prior year mix of lti once the total annual grant date present value for a neo is determined the human resources compensation committee grants of this value in psus and in pbrsus under this approach strong long term performance relative to peers on critical metrics becomes the key driver of compensation realized by executive officers psus our psus have a three year performance period and are settled in stock the plan payout is intended to reflect the same key metrics we use to manage our business and drive shareholder returns over time each metric is compared relative to our retail peer group and is intended to incent management to outperform the peer group over the long term the three relative metrics used in our psu plan are change in market share a companys change in market share is calculated by determining the difference between b and a and dividing that difference by a the market is the sum of domestic net sales for us and our retail peer group a the companys domestic net sales in the baseline year is divided by the markets domestic net sales for the baseline year b the companys domestic net sales in the final year of the performance period is divided by the markets domestic net sales for the final year eps growth the compound annual growth rate of our eps from continuing operations versus the reported eps from continuing operations of our retail peer group after tax roic three year average net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital for both our results and our retail peer group excluding discontinued operations with these three independent metrics our psu program supports the critical drivers of our success to grow the top line relative to the retail sector to grow it profitably and to ensure prudent deployment of capital to drive the business the following example illustrates psu payouts at various levels of performance for more information about our peer groups see pages target corporation proxy statement back to contents psu adjustments the intent of our psu program is to measure performance relative to our peer group on the previously described metrics to achieve this measurement in an objective manner we base the initial rankings on annual reported financial results of each member of the retail peer group and target unless determined otherwise at the time of grant the human resources compensation committee has reserved discretion to adjust the reported financial results for target or any member of the retail peer group if it believes such adjustments necessary to properly gauge targets relative performance adjustments to target and peer results if any are disclosed in the proxy in the year of payout historically adjustments to targets results have not been material in nature eliminated items that did not reflect our core operations and ultimately decreased participants resulting payouts the only adjustment to our peers results historically has been a reduction in sales to remove the impact of the rd week in the retail accounting calendar to ensure consistency on relative market share comparisons psu payout we did not meet the m minimum performance condition for fiscal required to earn the psu payout pbrsus in january the human resources compensation committee granted pbrsu awards in connection with fiscal performance the pbrsu amount will be

the human resources compensation committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of our non ceo executive officer pay packages and for developing a recommendation for our ceos pay package that is reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full board the human resources compensation committee receives assistance from two sources a an independent compensation consulting firm semler brossy consulting group sbcg and b our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president chief human resources officer all decisions regarding executive compensation and final recommendations to the independent members of the full board are made solely by the human resources compensation committee the human resources compensation committee may not delegate its primary responsibility of overseeing executive officer compensation but it may delegate to management the administrative aspects of our compensation plans that do not involve the setting of compensation levels for executive officers human resources compensation committees independent consultant sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the human resources compensation committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target the committee assessed sbcgs independence in light of the sec and nyse listing standards and determined that no conflict of interest or independence concerns exist with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the human resources compensation committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the human resources compensation committees consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies on its understanding of targets business and compensation programs and sbcgs independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with our ceo with respect to ceo compensation sbcg also provides an independent assessment of the ceos recommendations on neo compensation to

perform other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation our executive vice president chief human resources officer and the ceo work together to develop our ceos

executive officers tdc the tdc levels and elements described in the preceding pages are evaluated annually for each executive officer relative to our retail and general industry peer group companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data obtained from publicly available proxy statements analyzed by sbcg and proprietary survey data assembled by willis towers watson and korn ferry hay group due to a range of factors including the scope of neo positions tenure in role and company specific concerns there is an imperfect comparability of neo positions between companies as such market position served as a reference point in the tdc determination process rather than a formula driven outcome the retail peer group was formulated based on an initial screen of companies in the global industry classification standard retailing index with revenue from core retail operations greater than billion the retail peer group is also used within our lti plans targets relative performance compared to this peer group on key metrics determines overall payout for our psu and pbrsu awards general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and among the leaders in their industries the composition of the peer groups is reviewed

upon termination or change in control this section explains the payments and benefits to which our currently employed neos are entitled in various termination of employment and change in control scenarios the potential payments to the currently employed neos are hypothetical situations only and assume that termination of employment and or change in control occurred on january the last day of our fiscal year and that any change in control was at our fiscal year end closing stock price of per share beginning in january a double trigger applies to rsus pbrsus or psu awards meaning that no outstanding awards of those types granted on or after january will accelerate upon a change in control unless an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason occurs the intent of this section is to isolate those payments and benefits for which the amount vesting or time of payment is altered by the described situations this section does not cover all amounts the neos will receive following termination specifically the neos are entitled to receive their vested balances under our pension and deferred compensation plans as disclosed in the preceding tables under all employment termination scenarios in addition unless the termination is for cause generally defined as deliberate and serious disloyal or dishonest conduct they retain their vested stock option awards and if they meet specified minimum age and years of service requirements at the time of termination the unvested portion of stock options and psus are not forfeited and vesting will continue according to the original schedule for defined periods a description of these age and years of service requirements is provided in the notes under the outstanding

voluntary termination none of our currently employed neos are entitled to payments and benefits for which the amount vesting or time of payment is altered by their voluntary termination involuntary termination if a neo was involuntarily terminated for cause he or she would not be eligible for any of the post termination benefits described in this section if a neo is involuntarily terminated without cause the potential post termination benefits generally consist of severance payments under our income continuance policy icp and accelerated vesting of of the at goal payout of pbrsu awards and forfeiture of the remaining our icp provides for continuation of annual cash compensation salary and average of three most recent bonuses and non equity incentive plan payments over a period ranging from to months paid in equal monthly installments each of the neos is eligible for months of income continuation under the icp payments under the icp are conditioned on the executive officer releasing any claims against us a non solicitation covenant and are subject to reduction if the executive officer becomes employed by specified competitors in addition a neo who receives severance payments under our icp also receives a allowance for outplacement services the accelerated vesting provisions of pbrsu awards are described in the notes under the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year end table death if a neo dies while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of accelerated vesting of stock options vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and life insurance proceeds equal to three times the sum of the prior years annual base salary plus the most recent bonus and non equity incentive plan payments up to a maximum of million in addition the neos beneficiary will have the right to receive a payout if any under psus after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period disability if a neo becomes totally and permanently disabled while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and monthly payments under the excess long term disability plan if he or she also participated in the widely available qualified long term disability plan our excess long term disability plan a self insured unfunded plan provides monthly disability income payments with respect to the portion of annualized salary and three year average bonus and non equity incentive plan compensation above the annual compensation limit currently set at but not exceeding million the plan replaces of a participants eligible compensation a participant who becomes disabled before age is eligible to receive payments under the plan while he or she is totally and permanently disabled

an actual or threatened contested election will not be considered as having been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors any person or group acquires or more of our common stock we merge with or into another company and our shareholders own less than of the combined company or our shareholders approve an agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve our company our plans do not provide for any gross ups for taxes due on any payments described in this section target corporation proxy statement back to contents without termination of employment the consequence of a change in control to the neos without termination of employment is generally as follows the deferred compensation balance in the edcp will be paid in a lump sum as soon as allowed under irc section a unless the board of directors determines not to accelerate payment of these amounts and a double trigger applies to pbrsus or psu awards meaning that no vesting will accelerate upon a change in control unless an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason occurs with involuntary or good reason termination of employment in addition to the payments upon a change in control explained under without termination of employment if a neos employment terminates involuntarily without cause or voluntarily with good reason a material reduction in compensation or responsibilities or a required relocation following a change in control following a change in control the double trigger requirement will be met and the post termination benefits that may be received generally consist of severance payments under our icp accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options and for outstanding pbrsus and psus the greater of a the amount the recipient would have been entitled to had the termination occurred without a change in control which ranges from to depending on the award type and the participants age and years of service or b a pro rata portion of the at goal payout based on the percentage of the three year vesting or performance period that has elapsed as of the date of the termination following the change in control the balance of the awards is forfeited we use the greater of calculation for pbrsus and psus to prevent a neo from receiving less due to a change in control than they would have received as a result of a similar termination absent a change in control in addition we use the at goal payout for calculating the pro rata portion rather than actual performance to eliminate arbitrary results that could occur with a shortened performance period and in case calculation of actual or comparable performance metrics would be unfeasible following the change in control target corporation proxy statement back to contents

the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that encourages outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term shareholders are urged to read the cda

human resources compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interests of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of targets shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the

to present the say on pay vote to shareholders target corporation proxy statement back to contents item five approval of the target corporation executive officer cash incentive plan introduction the independent members of the board of directors upon recommendation by the human resources compensation committee of the board of directors adopted the target corporation executive officer cash incentive plan on march subject to shareholder approval incentive plan the incentive plan is substantially similar to the target corporation officer short term incentive plan approved in referred to as the current stip for purposes of this item five we are seeking shareholder approval of the incentive plan because one of the conditions for qualification as performance based compensation for u s tax purposes is that the shareholders must approve the material terms of the plan and re approve those material terms every five years shareholder approval of the incentive plan will allow us to preserve the tax deduction for our performance based officer compensation payable under the incentive plan that may otherwise exceed the deduction limit established by section m of the internal revenue code see tax matters below the purpose of the incentive plan like our current stip is to promote our pay for performance compensation philosophy by providing cash incentive awards to executive officers who through their efforts directly and significantly impact the achievement of our goals and objectives the incentive plan gives the human resources compensation committee discretion to choose one or more appropriate performance measures by which to measure executive officers performance in any given performance period the performance measures are set at the beginning of each performance period summary of the plan the basic features of the incentive plan are summarized below the incentive plan will not become effective unless approved by the shareholders administration the human resources compensation committee all of whose members are independent outside directors will administer the incentive plan the human resources compensation committee will have the authority to grant cash incentive awards upon such terms consistent with the terms of the incentive plan as it considers appropriate to our executive officers the human resources compensation committee will have authority to interpret all provisions of the incentive plan to adopt amend and rescind rules and regulations pertaining to the administration of the incentive plan and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the incentive plan eligibility any executive officer designated by the human resources compensation committee from time to time is eligible to participate in the incentive plan for a given performance period in fiscal approximately executive officers were selected to participate in the current stip and participation in the incentive plan is expected to be comparable determination of performance measures awards may be based on one or more of the following performance measures chosen by the human resources compensation committee performance measures revenues profitability measured by return ratios including but not limited to return on assets return on equity return on invested capital and return on revenue sales cash flow including but not limited to operating cash flow free cash flow and cash flow return on investment comparable sales margins including but not limited to one or more of gross operating and net earnings margins earnings before one or more of interest taxes depreciation and amortization cost and expense management net earnings economic value added or similar value added measurements earnings per share total shareholder return target corporation proxy statement back to contents in addition for any award to a participant who is not a covered officer under section m of the internal revenue code or that is not intended to constitute performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code the performance measures may include alone or in combination with the performance measures listed above any other measure of performance as determined by the human resources compensation committee the human resources compensation committee may select different performance measures for different participants in any performance period the human resources compensation committee also selects the relevant performance periods which must be at least one fiscal quarter in addition to selecting the performance measures the human resources compensation committee will also approve the level of attainment required to earn a payment under an award the required level of attainment can be measured as an absolute amount on a per share basis measured as a change from prior periods measured against or in relationship to other companies comparably similar or otherwise situated or measured against other indices or external measures and may relate to consolidated results or performance of a segment subsidiary operating company division unit or test strategy or new venture of target each measure may also be adjusted as the committee determines to exclude the effects of extraordinary items unusual or non recurring events and certain other items as the committee determines to be required to permit computation of the operating results on a consistent basis with the measures established for the performance period in recent years the human resources compensation committee has selected a combination of ebit and sales as the performance measures for the financial component of awards to our executive officers determination of cash incentive amounts the target opportunity for each participant will be determined by the human resources compensation committee at the beginning of the performance period the target opportunity may be established as a set dollar amount or as a percentage of the participants compensation typically based on a percentage of base salary in addition the human resources compensation committee may establish an incentive pool and determine each participants award based on a ratio of the participants award to all awards earned under the incentive plan multiplied by the pool at the end of the performance period the human resources compensation committee will certify levels of achievement of the performance measures and pay out any earned awards in the form of cash payments the human resources compensation committee has discretion to exclude the effects of extraordinary items unusual or non recurring events and other items to permit consistent computation so long as such adjustments to awards intended to constitute performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code do not preclude the awards from so qualifying maximum payments no executive officer shall receive awards intended to constitute performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code payable in any fiscal year that exceed the lesser of million or of the participants base salary as of the date of grant of the award tax matters as described in the cda in this proxy statement section m of the internal revenue code limits the deductibility of compensation paid to our covered officers to million per year this limitation does not apply to performance based compensation one of the conditions for qualification as performance based compensation is that the shareholders must approve the material terms of the plan which include a general description of the employees eligible to receive compensation under the plan a description of the business criteria on which any performance goals are to be based and the maximum amount of the compensation that could be paid to any employee if the applicable performance goals are attained and re approve those material terms every five years amounts paid under the objective performance measures established under the incentive plan will under current tax law continue to qualify as performance based compensation if shareholders approve the incentive plan new plan benefits the incentive plan will be effective february so long as it is approved by shareholders prior to june as a result the first awards granted under the incentive plan will relate to fiscal amounts payable under the incentive plan for fiscal are not determinable because the performance measures and target opportunities will not be set by the human resources compensation committee until early in
