conflict minerals rule as used in this report consistent with the conflict minerals rule tg means columbite tantalite coltan cassiterite gold wolframite and the derivatives tantalum tin and tungsten a applicability of the conflict minerals ruleto target target is a retailer selling both everyday essentials and fashionable differentiated merchandise at discounted prices target does not manufacture any of the products it sells a significant portion of targets sales is from national brand merchandise approximately one third of targets fiscal sales related to owned and exclusive brand products target may be subject to the requirements of the conflict minerals rulebecause of the degree of influence that it may exercise over the materials parts ingredients or components of some of its owned and exclusive brand products that contain necessary tg for for purposes of its compliance with the conflict minerals rule target had potentially in scope products in the owned and exclusive brand merchandise categories in the table below the surveyed product categories as discussed herein for targets outreach included all of the vendors of products that were identified as possibly containing tg within the surveyed product categories the surveyed vendors regardless of whether the products of a particular vendor were believed to contain necessary tg and regardless of whether target may have

automotive footwear and luggage accessories jewelry and watches furniture home dcor bath and seasonal merchandise lawn and garden health and beauty products toys sporting goods and pet supplies paper office stationery and scrapbooking the merchandise categories listed above are intended to summarize the types of owned and exclusive brand products target sells that might be within the scope of the

all of the products it sells for target was unable to determine the origin of at least a portion of the necessary tg contained in the products of surveyed vendors in some instances surveyed vendors reported that for they did not source from the democratic republic of the congo the drc or an adjoining country however target did not conclude that any of its in scope products were drc conflict free within the meaning of the conflict minerals rule targets findings about the source of necessary tg in products from surveyed vendors for were limited by the fact that some vendors did not respond to targets survey many surveyed vendors reported only partial supply chain information and most vendors did not provide information about the source of necessary tg on an individual product basis instead providing aggregate information for all of their products target does not do any direct business with any smelters or refiners of tg as a downstream company which means a company between the smelter or refiner and the consumer target must rely on its vendors to provide accurate reliable information about tg in its supply chain target also believes that in most cases it is several or more vendor tiers removed from the smelters and refiners of tg used in its products however through the efforts described in this conflict minerals report including its support of multi stakeholder initiatives target is helping to address some of those difficulties presented to downstream companies and to encourage responsible sourcing in its supply chain b targets conflict minerals policy participation in industry initiatives target supports the humanitarian goals of the conflict minerals ruleand recognizes the adverse impact from mining and trade of tg by armed groups in the drc and its adjoining countries target seeks to neither finance nor benefit those armed groups directly or indirectly target also recognizes that there are many smelters and refiners that source from the drc and its adjoining countries whose activities do not finance or benefit armed groups and who are certified as conformant as defined in annex a in order to avoid the undue harm to local populations that a generalized embargo upon this region could perform target encourages its suppliers to identify conformant smelters and refiners within the drc and its adjoining countries and to source from them when commercially practicable targets conflict minerals policy the conflict minerals policy seeks to balance targets objectives of ensuring that its business activities do not finance or benefit armed groups and providing support to conformant smelters and refiners in the drc and its adjoining countries the conflict minerals policy states that target will not knowingly purchase or sell any owned or exclusive brand product that contains tg that finances armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country the conflict minerals policy also encourages targets suppliers to source from smelters and refiners within the drc and its adjoining countries that are certified as conformant the conflict minerals policy also includes targets expectation that each of the vendors with which it contracts to manufacture will adopt a policy relating to tg sourcing that is consistent with targets conflict minerals policy and the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict affected and high risk areas third edition the oecd due diligence guidance complete a conflict minerals reporting template which is the standard form developed by the responsible minerals initiative the rmi for gathering information regarding tg usage and related sourcing procedures the reporting template exercise due diligence in seeking upstream information to support the vendors responses to the questions in the reporting template use smelters and refiners certified as conformant but avoid a generalized embargo of smelters or refiners in the drc region and make available its
