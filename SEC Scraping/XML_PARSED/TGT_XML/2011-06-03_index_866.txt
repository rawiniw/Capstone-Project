target corporation form k for the fiscal year ended january filed march file no dear mr thompson this letter is in response to your letter dated may following this introductory section is a specific response to each of your eight numbered comments in that letter with your comments in italics preceding each related response as a company we place a high priority on providing clear and useful disclosures to the readers of our sec filings and we always welcome the opportunity to review our practices in an effort to make our disclosures even better should the staff after review and consideration of our responses have further questions or comments we would welcome direct dialogue and collaboration to discuss suggestions for future filings form k for the fiscal year ended january item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page analysis of operations page retail segment page we note your presentation of consolidated ebitda and ebit and related margins rates in the tables we also note that ebit is the measure of segment profit or loss of the retail segment reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess performance however we note that the measure of segment profit or loss of the credit card segment and on a consolidated basis reflects a reduction of ebit for interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables as such it appears that consolidated ebitda and ebit and related margin rates are non gaap financial measures and that you should provide a reconciliation of ebitda and ebit to net income reported for each year and disclosures required by item e of regulation s x please revise or advise targets response to comment we would like to clarify that the ebitda and ebit amounts and related margin rates presented in the tables in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda on page of our form k are not consolidated amounts or rates these amounts and rates pertain only to our retail segment and were determined in accordance with asc topic similarly our discussion of credit card segment profit in the tables of the mda on page is a presentation of that segment only and does not represent consolidated results this presentation of segment profit was also determined in accordance with asc topic note to our consolidated financial statements is our asc required footnote that presents the results of each segment and the reconciliation to our consolidated financial statements please note in particular that we do not discuss or describe the total of individual segment profit outside of the context of our asc footnote rather the discussion in the mda is limited to individual segment results based on the foregoing we believe our disclosure is in complete accord with the divisions compliance disclosure interpretations on non gaap financial measures last update january specifically questions and indicate that measures of segment profitability determined in accordance with asc topic are not non gaap financial measures and that the discussion in mda of segment information determined in conformity with asc topic is not prohibited by item e ii of regulation s k moreover our disclosure is distinguishable from the situation described in question where the division indicated that the presentation of the total of individual segment profit or loss outside of the required asc footnote would be the presentation of a non gaap financial measure as mentioned above target does not present such a measure of aggregate segment results outside of note to our consolidated financial statements in order to aid the readers of our mda we plan to add a cross reference to our segment footnote in future filings an example of this disclosure is as follows see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes item financial statements and supplementary data page notes to consolidated financial statements page credit card receivables page allowance for doubtful accounts page we note that your allowance for doubtful accounts represents an amount equal to the anticipated future write offs of existing receivables which includes provisions for uncollectable finance charges and other credit related fees but that write offs exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges we also note from your disclosure in note on page that uncollected finance charges and late fees are recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues when accounts are written off please tell us how write offs of uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees is considered in the table and how the allowance provisions related to uncollectible finance charges and late fees is relieved when accounts are written off targets response to comment the following paragraphs describe our accounting for recording credit card related revenue including our accounting for uncollectible revenues and principal balances we believe this accounting is consistent with bank regulatory guidance and credit card industry practice on reversal of previously accrued but uncollected finance charges and other credit related fees against the applicable consolidated statements of operations line item for ease of reading we have italicized account names in our response credit card revenues including finance charges and other credit related fees are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement as accrued finance charges and other credit related fees are reflected in receivables on the consolidated statements of financial position therefore we base our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an assessment of the collectability of both the outstanding principal balance and accrued finance charges and other credit related fees to appropriately reflect the expected losses inherent in our receivables as of the dates of consolidated statements of financial position when an account is written off we credit receivables for the full account balance debit allowance for doubtful accounts for the principal portion and debit credit card revenues for the finance charge and fee portion as a result of this accounting write offs of uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees reduce bad debt expense in the allowance for doubtful accounts table in note to our consolidated financial statements at the end of each period we assess the appropriateness of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make any necessary adjustment with a corresponding charge or credit to bad debt expense please tell us your consideration of disclosing the information about impaired loans at the end of each period including i the total recorded investment in impaired loans ii the amount of the recorded investment in impaired loans for which there is a related allowance for credit losses and the amount of that allowance and iii the amount of the recorded investment in impaired loans for which there is no related allowance for credit losses please refer to asc targets response to comment we evaluate our loans credit card receivables for potential impairment collectively and establish our allowance only at the portfolio level based on the guidance in asc and asc the disclosure requirements in asc to are not applicable to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment the guidance in asc goes on to clarify that large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are excluded from the disclosure requirements of asc unless those loans have been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring tdr under certain circumstances we offer cardholder payment plans that modify finance charges and minimum payments which meet the accounting definition of a tdr these concessions are made on an individual cardholder basis for economic or legal reasons specific to each individual cardholders circumstances in accordance with the requirements of asc within note to our consolidated financial statements we disclosed receivables classified as tdrs as a percentage of period end gross receivables as of january tdrs represented percent or million of our billion period end gross receivables balance as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements once restructured tdrs are treated consistently with other aged receivables in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts therefore all tdrs would have a related allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collective assessment of impairment at the portfolio level for this reason we have not disclosed the amount of tdrs for which there is a related allowance for doubtful accounts we believe our disclosures which include analyses of loan aging allowance for doubtful accounts and credit quality analyses are sufficient in light of the requirements of asc inventory page please tell us your consideration of disclosing the excess of replacement or current cost over stated lifo value please refer to paragraph c of rule of regulation s x targets response to comment if the lifo inventory method is used paragraph c of rule of regulation s x requires that the excess of replacement or current cost over stated lifo value be disclosed parenthetically or in a note to the consolidated financial statements if the difference is material the current replacement cost of our inventories did not materially differ from stated lifo value for any year presented and for this reason we did not make any disclosure of this difference on january the approximate replacement cost of our inventories was million and the stated lifo value was million on january the approximate replacement cost of our inventories was million and the stated lifo value was million commitments and contingencies page we note that you have recorded reserves for probable and estimable losses on claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business please tell us your consideration of providing an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued and or providing a statement that such estimates cannot be made please also tell us why the investigation by the epa disclosed in item on page is not disclosed in the notes to financial statements and whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable please refer to asc targets response to comment in the course of assessing our exposure related to claims and litigation we consider the potential for losses in excess of the amount accrued this analysis includes whether any such excess exposure is reasonably possible or remote and whether any reasonably possible excess exposure would be material to our financial condition liquidity or results of operations in accordance with asc as augmented by asc which permits exclusion of immaterial items if we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility of a material exposure in excess of the amount accrued we would make the disclosures required by that standard in preparing our form k for the fiscal year ended january we concluded that we did not have any matters that were reasonably possible to result in a material liability to target corporation the epa investigation noted in your comment letter was not disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements because we determined that the exposure is not material this matter is disclosed in item solely because of the disclosure threshold applicable to environmental matters required by item of regulation s k notes payable and long term debt page we note that your credit facility contains a debt leverage covenant please tell us whether this covenant limits the payment of dividends if so please tell us what consideration you gave to the disclosure requirements of rule e of regulation s x targets response to comment rule e of regulation s x requires that we describe the most significant restrictions on the payment of dividends indicating their sources their pertinent provisions and the amount of retained earnings or net income restricted or free of restrictions our debt leverage covenant within our credit facility places a limitation on the ratio of our total finance liabilities to our total capitalization as defined in the agreement this covenant however has no practical effect on our payment of dividends our declared dividends would have had to exceed billion to be noncompliant with our debt leverage covenant in we declared dividends totaling only million we have therefore concluded that no disclosure is required under rule e of regulation s x because the restrictions are not significant segment reporting page please tell us your consideration of disclosing revenues for each group or category of products and services please refer to asc targets response to comment we disclose the percentage of merchandise sales by product category within item of our form k we have used this format due to the complexities inherent in tracking sales adjustments by product category the most significant of which include sales returns sales discounts applied to an entire transaction and our ever evolving mix of merchandise within and between product categories we disclose the percentage of sales rounded to the nearest whole percentage point to provide transparency into product category sales which provides an appropriate level of precision in future annual filings we will also include the table that has historically been presented in item of our form k in our segment footnote we expect that our disclosure will take the following form percentageofsales salesbyproductcategory household essentials hardlines apparel and accessories home furnishings and dcor food and pet supplies total quarterly results unaudited page please tell us your consideration of disclosing gross profit in accordance with item a of regulation s k targets response to comment we have not historically disclosed gross profit in our quarterly results table because we present a single step income statement that does not include separate disclosure of gross profit credit card revenues are a component of total revenues so we believe that presenting total revenues and also gross profit without further information may be misleading as a result we determined that it would be more appropriate to disclose ebit in our quarterly results table in future annual filings we will enhance our existing disclosure by reproducing the entire consolidated statements of operations for each quarterly period an example of our planned disclosure is as follows quarterlyresults firstquarter secondquarter thirdquarter fourthquarter totalyear millions exceptpersharedata sales credit card revenues total revenues cost of sales selling general and administrative expenses credit card expenses depreciation and amortization earnings before interest expense and income taxes net interest expense nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables other interest expense interest income net interest expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share weighted average common shares outstanding basic diluted dividends declared per share closing common stock price high low we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filings that staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filings and that we may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the united states on behalf of target corporation i thank you for your consideration of our responses sincerely douglas a scovanner executive vice president and chief financial officer
