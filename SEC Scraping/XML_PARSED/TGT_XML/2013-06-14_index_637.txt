december table of contents target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund continued the svf consisted of investments in collective trust funds and guaranteed investments contracts synthetic gics synthetic gics were investment contracts in which the plan owned the underlying assets and purchased wrap contracts from independent third parties that provided market value and cash flow risk protection to the plan investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts as it reflects the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan the statements of net assets available for benefits presented the fair value of the svf as well as the adjustment to contract value for the difference between the underlying svfs fair value and contract value or the adjustment to contract value the synthetic gics were fully benefit responsive and were wrapped by two separate insurance companies which provided guarantees with respect to the return of funds to make distributions from this investment option the wrapper issuers were contractually obligated to repay the principal and a specified interest rate that was guaranteed to the plan there were no reserves against contract values for credit risk of the contract issuers or otherwise contributions to the svf were invested in a portfolio of collective trust funds as well as investments in the portfolio underlying the synthetic gics this portfolio included short term investment funds high quality short term and intermediate term u s bonds including u s government treasuries corporate debt securities other high credit quality asset backed securities futures and interest rate swaps these investments were measured at fair value as described in note amounts due from broker for securities sold and due to broker for securities purchased presented on the plans statements of net assets available for benefits primarily related to transactions involving the synthetic gics underlying portfolio these amounts were factored into the fair value of the underlying portfolio for purposes of calculating crediting rates and calculating the adjustment from fair value to contract value the fair value of the wrap contracts was the replacement cost of those contracts the synthetic gics contract value represented the sum of participants contributions plus earnings less participants withdrawals and administrative expenses participant accounts in the svf were credited with interest at a fixed rate that was evaluated quarterly the primary variables affecting the future crediting rates included the current yield of the assets underlying the contract the duration of the assets underlying the contracts and the existing difference between the fair value and the contract table of contents target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund continued value of the assets within the insurance contract the crediting rate of security backed contracts tracked current market yields on a trailing basis the rate reset allowed the contract value to converge with the fair value of the underlying portfolio over time assuming the portfolio continued to earn the current yield for a period of time equal to the current portfolio duration to the extent that the underlying portfolio had unrealized and or realized losses a positive adjustment was made when reconciling from fair value to contract value under contract value accounting as a result the future crediting rate may have been lower over time than the current market rates similarly if the underlying portfolio generated unrealized and or realized gains a negative adjustment was made when reconciling from fair value to contract value and in the future the crediting rate may have been higher than the current market rates the insurance contracts could not credit an interest rate that was less than the average yields earned by the svf at december were based on actual earnings and based on the interest rate credited to participants derivatives derivative financial instruments are used by the itbf and were used by the svf principally to reduce exposures to interest rate and market risks the itbf invests in over the counter interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate fluctuation
