our committees consist exclusively of independent directors diversity of relevant experiences the composition of our board represents broad perspectives experiences and knowledge relevant to our

structure mr cornell leads the board in his role as chairman mr cornell is also the chief executive officer we do not have an express policy as to whether the roles of chair of the board and chief executive officer should be combined or separated instead the board prefers to maintain the flexibility to determine which leadership structure best serves the interests of target based on the circumstances however if the chair ceo roles are combined as they are currently our corporate governance guidelines require that we have a lead independent director position to complement the chairs role and to serve as the principal liaison between the non management directors and the chair doug baker currently serves as our lead independent director the board regularly reevaluates our board leadership structure as part of the board evaluation process described under board evaluations on page during the past year the board supplemented its review of its leadership structure with the assistance of a third party organizational consultant the additional review was primarily driven by two events first a shareholder proposal at our annual meeting requesting that we adopt a policy to have an independent chairman received approximately support of the shares voted second we hired a new ceo at the time the board was engaged in its comprehensive ceo search the board made it clear that a decision of whether to combine the chair and ceo roles would be candidate specific the board concluded that mr cornells years of relevant experience including his ceo and public company board experience provide the proper leadership qualifications and sensitivity to the different roles of management and the board the board worked directly with the third party organizational consultant to review its leadership structure organization and functioning in arriving at an optimal leadership structure this review included discussion of the academic studies that compare an independent chair model with a combined chair ceo model and the attributes necessary in a lead independent director to foster strong independent leadership if the chair ceo roles are combined the boards decision to offer mr cornell both the chairman and ceo positions is also expected to serve targets goals by allowing mr cornell to coordinate the development articulation and execution of a unified strategy at the board and management levels the board has maintained its view that target should have the flexibility to determine whether to combine or separate the roles of chair and ceo through our shareholder engagement meetings following mr cornells appointment we concluded that although shareholders expressed different views on their preferred leadership structure there was no prevailing theme on a preferred structure for target corporation the board is committed to continuing to seek shareholder feedback on its approach as part of its ongoing shareholder outreach efforts and will continue to reassess its approach to this issue on a regular basis proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents lead independent director douglas m baker jr annual election elected annually by the

to hiring mr cornell the board appointed an experienced executive from our pool of internal candidates john mulligan our chief financial officer to serve in the additional capacities of interim president ceo the quality leadership provided by mr mulligan during that interim period allowed the board sufficient time to ensure that its comprehensive search resulted in hiring the right candidate to lead target risk oversight the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management the boards oversight of these risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the boards oversight of our business for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the boards regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with that strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and discusses with our senior executive officers the major events activities and challenges affecting their respective functional areas the boards ongoing oversight of risk also occurs at

corporation back to contents item five shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman john chevedden nelson avenue no redondo beach ca who held more than of shares of common stock on january intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting the language below in the resolution and shareholders supporting statement is reproduced without alteration resolution proposal independent board chairman resolved the shareholders request our board of directors to adopt as policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to require the chair of the board of directors whenever possible to bean independent member of the board the board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next ceo transition implemented so it did not violate any existing agreement if the board determines that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair shareholders supporting statement when our ceo is our board chairman this arrangement can hinder our boards ability to monitor our ceos performance many companies already have an independent chairman an independent chairman is the prevailing practice in the united kingdom and many international markets this proposal topic won plus support at major u s companies in including support at netflix this topic is particularly important for target since our lead director james johnson is supposed to serve in a checks and balances role in regard to our new ceo chairman brian cornell however mr clark sic had years long tenure to compromise his independence and received our highest negatives votes a whooping our clearly improvable corporate governance as reported in is an added incentive to vote for this proposal gmi ratings an independent investment research firm rated our board d seven of our directors received to in negative votes in this included every member of our audit committee and half our executive pay committee anne mulcahy and roxanne austin were potentially over extended with or director seats each on public companies plus ms mulcahy in negative votes and ms austin in negative votes were assigned to our audit committee which is the most demanding committee assignment gmi said multiple related party transactions and other potential conflicts of interest involving our companys board or senior managers should be reviewed in greater depth two shareholder actions were filed against target directors and officers following a major data breach alleging that they failed to ensure target had adequate data security and that they made false and misleading statements and failed to take adequate steps to protect target in the wake of the breach april returning to the core topic of this proposal from the context of our clearly improvable corporate governance please vote to protect shareholder value independent board chairman proposal position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and continues to believe that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders the board believes that any decision to maintain a combined chair ceo role or to separate these roles should be based on the specific circumstances of a corporation the independence and capabilities of its directors and the leadership provided by its ceo the board does not believe that separating the roles of chair and ceo should be mandated or that such a separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for shareholders the board prefers to maintain the flexibility to determine which leadership structure best serves the interests of target based on the circumstances the board regularly reevaluates its board leadership structure as part of the board evaluation process described under board evaluations on page proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents the board believes that its current leadership structure and governance practices allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically our corporate governance guidelines require us to have a lead independent director with significant responsibilities that are described in detail on pages whenever the roles of chair and ceo are combined as they are currently our lead independent director is elected annually by the independent non management directors and that position transitioned to doug baker in march independent directors meet frequently in executive sessions that are presided over by our lead independent director with no members of management present independent directors use these executive sessions to discuss matters of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate including evaluation of the ceo and senior management management succession planning matters to be included on board agendas board informational needs and board effectiveness the chairpersonsand all membersof the audit nominating governance and compensation committees are independent directors these board committee chairpersons determine matters to be discussed and materials to be evaluated in the areas covered by their respective committee charters as explained under board leadership structure on page of this proxy statement during the past year the board supplemented its review of its leadership structure with the assistance of a third party organizational consultant the additional review was primarily driven by two events first the same shareholder submitted this proposal at our annual meeting and it received approximately support of the shares voted second we hired a new ceo at the time the board was engaged in its comprehensive ceo search the board made it clear that a decision of whether to combine the chair and ceo roles would be candidate specific the board concluded that mr cornells years of relevant experience including his ceo and public company board experience provide the proper leadership qualifications and sensitivity to the different roles of management and the board the board worked directly with the third party organizational consultant to review its leadership structure organization and functioning in arriving at an optimal leadership structure this review included discussion of the academic studies that compare an independent chair model with a combined chair ceo model and the attributes necessary in a lead independent director to foster strong independent leadership if the chair ceo roles are combined the boards decision to offer mr cornell both the chairman and ceo positions is also expected to serve targets goals by allowing mr cornell to coordinate the development articulation and execution of a unified strategy at the board and management levels the board has maintained its view that target should have the flexibility to determine whether to combine or separate the roles of chair and ceo through shareholder engagement meetings following mr cornells appointment we concluded that although shareholders expressed different views on their preferred leadership structure there was no prevailing theme on a preferred structure for target corporation the board is committed to continuing to seek shareholder feedback on its approach as part of its ongoing shareholder outreach efforts and will continue to reassess its approach to this issue on a regular basis the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman item six shareholder proposal to adopt apolicy prohibiting discrimination against or for persons thomas strobhar beaver vu drive ste a beavercreek ohio who held more than of shares of common stock on january intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting the language below in the resolution and shareholders supporting statement is reproduced without alteration resolution the shareholders request the board of directors to institute the following policy there shall be no discrimination against or discrimination for persons based on race religion gender or sexual orientation in hiring vendor contracts or customer relations except where required by law proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents shareholders supporting statement the best way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race john roberts chief justice of the supreme court of the united states our country was founded on the principal of equality thousands of americans have given their last full measure of devotion for this principal we dishonor them by continuing practices that are inherently discriminatory we cannot discriminate for a particular group of persons for whatever reason without discriminating against another group let us resolve to commit our company to true equality position of the board of directors this shareholder submitted this same proposal at the annual meeting and it received just over support the board of directors has reconsidered this proposal in light of that result and continues to believe its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders because we already have policies and practices that the board believes and based on last years voting results our shareholders believe substantially address the proposal our existing equal opportunity policy provides that our employment practices will be implemented without regard to race color national origin sex including pregnancy religious beliefs age disability sexual orientation gender identity or expression citizenship status military status genetic information or any other basis protected by federal state or local fair employment practice laws in addition our standards of vendor engagement require our vendors to comply with local laws and seek to eliminate workplace discrimination based on race gender personal characteristics or beliefs our policies and practices comply with and are permitted by law but the proposal seeks to limit our policies and practices to only those required by law the board believes that arbitrarily limiting our legally permissible activities would put the company at a competitive disadvantage in particular the board believes the proposal would interfere with our ability to tailor our employment benefits and sourcing policies and to attract and retain a diverse workforce and vendor base at the heart of our company are the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of our more than target team members the diversity of our team fosters a unique inclusive culture that is collaborative dynamic and guided by our shared commitment to delivering outstanding results the market insight community building and commitment of our african american asian american hispanic lgbta womens and military business councils help make target a great place to work and inform business decisions that create a competitive advantage our vice president of diversity inclusion leads a team that works to integrate the business councils with our company wide diversity strategy we also believe it is important that our stores and merchandise reflect the communities in which we operate as a result we actively recruit and engage diverse suppliers and business partners through meaningful participation in national and local organizations focused on diverse business development in addition we extend this commitment to our involvement in many innovative programs partnerships and sponsorships that share our objective of fostering an inclusive culture we care about the needs of the communities we serve and embrace their diversity through our support information regarding our diversity programs is located at www target com diversity we believe the board and management are in the best position to determine the most effective approach to hiring vendor contracts and customer relations while complying with all applicable laws for these reasons we believe that adopting this proposal would not be in the best interests of target or its shareholders the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt a policy prohibiting discrimination against or for persons proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents questions and answers about our annual meeting
