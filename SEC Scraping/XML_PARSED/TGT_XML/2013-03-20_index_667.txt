date of hire and or length of service these company paid benefits include a pension plan k plan medical and dental plans a retiree medical plan disability insurance paid vacation tuition reimbursement various team member assistance programs life insurance and merchandise discounts we consider our team member relations to be good working capital because of the seasonal nature of our business our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from thanksgiving to the end of december the increase in working capital during this time is typically financed with cash flow provided by operations and short term borrowings additional details are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effective inventory management is key to our ongoing success we utilize various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management we achieve effective inventory management by being in stock in core product offerings maintaining positive vendor relationships and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns competition we compete with traditional and off price general merchandise retailers apparel retailers internet retailers wholesale clubs category specific retailers drug stores supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines our competitive position within

registered with the u s patent and trademark office we also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our owned brands geographic information through all of our revenues were

we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our in stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands discussed on page these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price we have been working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price match policy failure to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failure of our vendors to manage their own channels and content could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of target s reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities while reputations may take decades to build even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable multichannel experience for our guests our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected our business has evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels in store online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website target com applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments and technology investments by our competitors if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the table of contents specialized skills needed to support our multichannel efforts implement improvements to our guest facing technology in a timely manner or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if target com and our other guest facing technology systems do not reliably function as designed we may experience a loss of guest confidence data security breaches lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases which if significant could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel home dcor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states most of our stores and all of our digital sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on u s consumer confidence and the health of the u s economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions consumer confidence and guest financial situations could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with tdbank group td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit sharing payments if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected with approximately team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain qualified team members many of those team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations as of march none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and table of contents businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer s ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store sites is located in fully developed markets which is generally a more time consuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise out of stocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our results of operations in addition changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including labor fuel tariffs and currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations if our merchandise offerings including food drug and children s products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests if our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our guests and team members are unsuccessful we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests and team members we have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents to date all incidents we have experienced have been insignificant if we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of redcards decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping with us altogether the loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving team members could hurt our reputation cause team member recruiting and retention challenges increase our labor costs and affect how we operate our business table of contents our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations in addition the expansion of our retail store operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer we are dependent on a stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations table of contents a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process guest transactions service redcard accounts and summarize and analyze results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter a loss of guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations if we do not effectively execute our plan to expand retail store operations into canada our financial results could be adversely affected our entry into the canadian retail market is our first retail store expansion outside of the united states our ability to successfully open the expected number of canadian target stores on schedule depends in large measure upon our ability to remodel existing assets build our supply chain capabilities and technology systems and recruit hire and retain qualified team members in addition our ability to offer the expected assortment of merchandise in certain markets may be impacted by the availability of local vendors of certain types of goods the effective execution of our canadian retail store expansion is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada and achieve market acceptance by canadian guests if we do not effectively execute our expansion plan in canada our financial performance could be adversely affected a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including our canadian supply chain portions of our technology systems multichannel platforms and distribution network and extensions of credit for our redcard rewards loyalty program if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if those third parties fail to meet our performance standards and expectations our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services in house item b unresolved staff comments not applicable table

recognize a gain on sale of million related to consideration received in excess of the recorded amount of the receivables consideration received includes cash of billion and a beneficial interest asset of million the beneficial interest effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit sharing we expect to receive on the receivables sold based on historical payment patterns we estimate that the beneficial interest asset will be reduced over a four year period with larger reductions in the early years as a result a portion of the profit sharing payments we receive from td in the first four years of the arrangement will not be recorded as income on our consolidated statements of operations following the sale of our credit card portfolio in income from the profit sharing arrangement net of account servicing expenses will be recognized within sga expenses including the profit sharing arrangement in the u s segment will reduce the sga rate below the historical u s retail segment sga rate and raise ebitda and ebit margin rates above historical u s retail segment rates for comparison purposes historical u s retail segment and u s credit card segment results will be restated to forma new u s segment the combination of these two historical segments into a single u s segment will result in a higher sga rate in compared with and reflecting

remodel program which impacted the rate by percent and percent in and respectively partially offset by underlying rate improvements within categories in the redcard rewards loyalty program reduces gross margin rates because it drives incremental sales among guests who receive a percent discount on virtually all items purchased the remodel program reduces the overall gross margin rate because it drives incremental sales with a stronger than average mix in lower than average gross margin rate product categories primarily food we changed certain merchandise vendor contracts beginning in as a result we expect our gross margin rate to increase by about to basis points from prior years with an equal and offsetting increase in our sga rate this shift will result from a larger proportion of vendor income offsetting cost of sales as compared to certain advertising expenses within sga this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our sga rate will

affect our gross margin rate selling general and administrative expense rate our sga expense rate was percent percent and percent in and respectively the change in was primarily due to improvements in store hourly payroll expense which impacted the rate by percent and continued disciplined expense management across the company partially offset by technology and multichannel investments which impacted the rate by nearly percent the change in was primarily due to increased loyalty program charges to the u s credit segment and favorable leverage on store hourly payroll expense as noted above a change to certain merchandise vendor contracts is expected to increase our sga rate by about to basis points because vendor funding will no longer offset certain advertising expenses this change will have no impact on our ebitda or ebit margins or margin rates as our gross margin rate will increase by the same amount following the sale of our credit card portfolio in income from the profit

completed the sale to td for cash consideration of billion equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing concurrent with the sale of the portfolio we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables series variable funding certificate at par of billion resulting in net cash proceeds of billion as of march we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt over time we expect to apply the remaining proceeds from the sale in a manner that will preserve our strong investment grade credit ratings by further reducing our debt position and continuing our current share repurchase program year end inventory levels decreased slightly from million in to million

paid dividends every quarter since our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future short term and long term financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings as of february our credit ratings were as follows credit ratings standard and poor s moody s fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper p a f if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was x in x in and x in in we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through internally generated funds in we funded our peak

billion revolving credit facility obtained in october and expiring in october no balances were outstanding at any time during or under this facility most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and these covenants have no practical effect on our ability to pay dividends additionally at february no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non

merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketing related contracts software acquisition license commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met h we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of february our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the last in first out lifo method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was million and million at february and january respectively and is further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements table of contents vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable was million and million at february and january respectively and is described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements credit card receivables accounting historically our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts when receivables were recorded we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs the allowance included provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees we estimated future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends accounts were automatically written off when they became days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could have materially changed these expectations as of february our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale as a result of the credit card receivables transaction lower of cost par or fair value is determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost par because fair value exceeds cost delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our credit card receivables long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate a percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close as of february would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of long lived assets insurance self insurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at february and january respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures table of contents income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as deemed appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were million and million at february and january respectively we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was percent percent percent and percent for the year year year and year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older longer service pension eligible team members pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements legal contingencies we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur there may be a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods new accounting pronouncements we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements table of contents forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include for our u s credit card segment aggregate portfolio risks for our canadian segment the timing and amount of future capital investments in canada and our subsequent financial performance on a consolidated basis statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity the fair value of our consumer credit card

operating loss carryforwards and the resolution of tax matters all such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item a to this form k which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at february our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a libor plus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate historically to manage our net interest margin we generally maintained levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuated the degree of floating asset and liability matching varied over time and in different interest rate environments at february the amount of floating rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately billion see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of the sale of our consumer credit card portfolio funding risk was transferred to tdbank group following the sale our interest rate exposure will primarily be due to the extent by which our floating rate debt obligations differ from our floating rate short term investments in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against table of contents declines in interest rates we hold high quality long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant we are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we will be further exposed to this risk as we commence canadian operations during during and gains and losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates were not significant as all stores were located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise was purchased in u s dollars there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year table of contents item financial statements and

consideration received from vendors we receive consideration for a variety of vendor sponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances and for our compliance programs referred to as vendor income vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or sga expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement promotional and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores under our compliance programs vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements violations such as late or incomplete shipments these allowances are recorded when violations occur substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on provisions of the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we have completed our performance we perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate the majority of year end receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter we have not historically had significant write offs for these receivables table of contents advertising costs advertising costs which primarily consist of newspaper circulars

were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts with this agreement our receivables are classified as held for sale at february and are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value we recorded a gain of million outside of our segments in representing the net adjustment to eliminate our allowance for doubtful accounts and record our receivables at lower of cost par or fair value on march we completed the sale to td for cash consideration of billion equal to the gross par value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing subsequent to year end and concurrent with the sale of the portfolio we repaid the nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables series variable funding certificate at par of billion resulting in net cash proceeds of billion as of march we also have open tender offers to use up to an aggregate of billion of cash proceeds from the sale to repurchase outstanding debt following this sale td will underwrite fund and own target credit card and target visa receivables in the u s td will control risk management policies and oversee regulatory compliance and we will perform account servicing and primary marketing functions we will earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios this transaction will be accounted for as a sale and the receivables will no longer be reported on our consolidated statements of financial position table of contents beginning with the first quarter of we will no longer report a u s credit card segment income from the profit

excluding unamortized swap valuation adjustments and capital lease obligations as of february our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale we estimated the fair value of our consumer credit card portfolio to be approximately billion using a cash flow based economic profit model using level inputs including the forecasted performance of the portfolio and a market based discount rate we used internal data to forecast expected payment patterns and write offs revenue and operating expenses credit ebit yield related to the credit card portfolio changes in macroeconomic conditions in the united states could affect the estimated fair value used in our lower of cost par or fair value assessment which could cause gains or losses on our receivables held for sale a one percentage point change in the forecasted credit ebit yield would impact our fair value estimate by approximately million a one percentage point change in the forecasted discount rate would impact our fair value estimate by approximately million refer to note for more information on our credit card receivables transaction as of january we estimated that the fair value of our credit card receivables approximated par value the carrying amounts of accounts payable and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature table of contents cash equivalents cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase these

for doubtful accounts as of february our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale lower of cost par or fair value was determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost par because fair value exceeds cost delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables refer to note for more

charges and other credit related fees we estimated future write offs on the entire credit card portfolio collectively based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends we continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our u s credit card segment which allows us to evaluate the performance of the table of

net write offs we monitor both the credit quality and the delinquency status of the portfolio we consider accounts or more days past due as delinquent and we update delinquency status daily we also monitor risk in the portfolio by assigning internally generated scores to each account and by obtaining current fico scores a nationally recognized credit scoring model for a statistically

centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices under rim inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the inventory retail value rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality the use of rim will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory we routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest activity under this

redemptions and was not material in any period presented credit card revenues are recognized according to the contractual provisions of each credit card agreement when accounts are written off uncollected finance charges and late fees are recorded as a reduction of credit card revenues the discounts associated with loyalty programs are included as reductions in sales in our consolidated

we receive consideration for a variety of vendor sponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances and for our compliance programs referred to as vendor income vendor income reduces either our inventory costs or sga expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement promotional and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores under our compliance programs vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements violations such as late or incomplete shipments these allowances are recorded when violations occur substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on provisions of the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we have completed our performance we perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate advertising costs advertising costs which primarily consist of newspaper circulars internet advertisements and media broadcast are expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement and are recorded net of related vendor income earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is calculated as net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted eps includes the potentially dilutive impact of share based awards outstanding at period end consisting of the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued under performance share and restricted stock unit arrangements fair value measurements fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets level observable market inputs available at the measurement date other than quoted prices included in level and level unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data position valuation technique short term investments carrying value approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months prepaid forward contracts initially valued at transaction price subsequently valued by reference to the market price of target common stock interest rate swaps valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model e g interest rates and credit spreads model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data a credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit spreads company owned life insurance investments includes investments in separate accounts that are valued based on market rates credited by the insurer the fair value of marketable securities is determined using available market prices at the reporting date and would be classified as level the fair value of debt is generally measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of financial instruments and would be classified as level as of february our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale the carrying amounts of accounts payable and certain accrued and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term nature cash equivalents cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase cash equivalents also include amounts due from third party financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions credit card receivables historically our credit card receivables were recorded at par value less an allowance for doubtful accounts as of february our consumer credit card receivables are recorded at the lower of cost par or fair value because they are classified as held for sale many nondelinquent balances are recorded at cost par because fair value exceeds cost delinquent balances are generally recorded at fair value which reflects our expectation of losses on these receivables substantially all past due accounts accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are written off when they become days past due historically we recognized an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to the anticipated future write offs of existing receivables and uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees we estimated future write offs on the entire credit card portfolio collectively based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends we continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our u s credit card segment which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost par or fair value we consolidate the receivables within the trust and any debt securities issued by the trust or a related trust in our consolidated statements of financial position interests in our credit card receivables issued by the trust are accounted for as secured borrowings inventory the majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method rim using the last in first out lifo method inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices property and equipment property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter we amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of the assets useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets we use the straight line method to amortize leasehold acquisition costs commitments and contingencies we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments leases assets held under capital leases are included in property and equipment operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of the property at lease inception we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured the exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion the lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight line rent expense additionally the depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term rent expense is included in sga expenses some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes insurance maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises these expenses are classified in sga consistent with similar costs for owned locations rent income received from tenants who rent properties is recorded as a reduction to sga expense income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income at the enactment date we have not recorded deferred taxes when earnings from foreign operations are considered to be indefinitely invested outside the u s general liability and workers compensation liabilities general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value share based compensation compensation expense associated with share based awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the minimum required service period we use a black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the options at the grant date volatility represents an average of market estimates for implied volatility of target common stock the risk free interest rate is an interpolation of the relevant u s treasury security maturities as of each applicable grant date the expected life is estimated based on an analysis of options already exercised and any foreseeable trends or changes in recipients behavior the fair value of performance share units is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant the expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued the fair value for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant the expense recognized each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued pension and postretirement health care plans prior service cost amortization is determined using the straight line method over the average remaining service period of team members expected to receive benefits under the plan the discount rate used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year is the rate as of the beginning of the year i e the prior measurement date the market related value of plan assets which is used in calculating expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost is determined each year by adjusting the previous year s value by expected return benefit payments and cash contributions the market related value is adjusted for asset gains and losses in equal percent adjustments over a five year period position valuation technique cashandcashequivalents these investments are cash holdings and investment vehicles valued using the net asset value nav provided by the administrator of the fund the nav for the investment vehicles is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus applicable costs and liabilities and then divided by the number of shares outstanding equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded common collective trusts balanced funds certain multi strategy hedge funds valued using the nav provided by the administrator of the fund the nav is a quoted transactional price for participants in the fund which do not represent an active market fixed income and government securities valued using matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics private equity real estate certain multi strategy hedge funds other valued by deriving target s proportionate share of equity investment from audited financial statements private equity and real estate investments require significant judgment on the part of the fund manager due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such investments certain multi strategy hedge funds represent funds of funds that include liquidity restrictions and for which timely valuation information is not available segment reporting our segment measure of profit is used by management to evaluate the return on our

value was determined on a segmented basis using the delinquency and credit quality segmentation we have historically used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts many nondelinquent balances

charges and other credit related fees we estimated future write offs on the entire credit card portfolio collectively based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends we continue to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense within our u s credit card segment which allows us to evaluate the performance of the portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is eliminated in consolidation to present the receivables at the lower of cost par or fair value allowance for doubtful accounts millions allowance at beginning of

both the credit quality and the delinquency status of the portfolio we consider accounts or more days past due as delinquent and we update delinquency status daily we also monitor risk in the
