these important issues proposal no on target corporations proxy statement argument in favor resolved the shareholders request that the board of directors adopt a policy prohibiting the use of corporate funds for any political election or campaign supporting statement we believe this policy should include any direct or indirect contribution that is intended to influence the outcome of an election or referendum it should also prohibit the use of trade associations or non profit corporations from channeling our companys contributions or membership dues to influence the outcome of any election or referendum the green century equity fund has submitted this proposal for consideration by fellow shareholders we urge you to cast a yes vote in favor of this proposal for the reasons outlined below our proposal seeks to ensure that target corporation protects itself from the reputational damage that may come from spending corporate general treasury funds to influence electoral politics the company has experienced firsthand the impact that controversial contributions can have on the companys reputation and employee morale demonstrating that such spending can result in business risk as a result we believe the only way to eliminate such a risk entirely is to refrain from making political contributions this is not a solicitation of authority to vote your proxy please

companies can reduce risk and protect shareholder value while consensus is far from established some academic studies indicate that political spending may not have a positive impact on the companys bottom line and in fact may erode shareholder value the proposal would not curtail the companys ability to engage in the political process as it has other means to communicate its views to policymakers there are a growing number of companies that are making the determination that it is in their best interest to refrain from political giving corporate political spending is fraught with risk and increasingly unpopular with the general public corporate political spending is risky the supreme courts january citizens united decision reversed the long standing prohibition on the unlimited use of corporate treasury funds for political purposes shareholders are increasingly concerned that such funds which can be funneled to superpacs trade associations and other organizations for political use often without proper oversight or board and shareholder knowledge could create a risk to shareholder value in target experienced firsthand the backlash and impact that making controversial contributions can have a bloomberg business week piece summed up the situation as follows target tgt the second largest u s discount retailer has become an early test case of a supreme court ruling that allows companies to spend unlimited amounts to sway voters in federal races it donated to a business advocacy group which used the funds to run an ad supporting a socially conservative republican candidate for governor of minnesota along the way target enraged the gay community offering up a cautionary tale for other corporations about taking sides in political campaigns in that case the company made a contribution to mn forward a group supporting tom emmer a gubernatorial candidate in minnesota who opposed marriage equality in response to the donation the company experienced boycotts public backlash and degradation of employee morale in another example activists launched boycotts of valero and tesoro in after the two texas based oil companies contributed millions to a campaign to repeal california legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because it is extremely difficult to determine which contributions may be considered controversial and very small monetary amounts can expose the company to significant backlash the proponent contends that it is in targets best interest to eliminate the risk entirely by refraining

campaign spending is becoming increasingly unpopular among the general public in the two election cycles following the us supreme courts landmark citizens united decision an unprecedented amount of money has flowed into national and state level political elections spending by outside groups between the and mid term elections rose from nearly million to approximately million in those cycles the number of registered super pacs alone rose from a mere in august to by december these developments are deeply unpopular among the u s public in february an abc news washington post poll found that

in washington in this presidential primary season there has been an explosion of media coverage devoted to the rise of superpacs c organizations and other vehicles for unlimited and often secret spending that have emerged from the loopholes affirmed by citizens united some academic studies indicate that political spending may not have a positive impact on the companys bottom line and in fact may erode shareholder value while there are academic studies on both sides of this issue a recent literature review submitted as comment to the sec in support of a petition that would require public companies to disclose corporate political spending by professor michael hadani of long island university finds that political spending may not benefit and in some cases could harm a companys bottom line to summarize this report described the findings of a large scale literature meta analysis a large scale empirical analysis and supplemental findings all of which strongly indicate that firms political spending in particular contributions to policy makers at best has an insubstantial impact on their bottom line and more often results in a negative effect of firm financial performance shareholders as noted above are already concerned with the opaque nature of firms political spending and with good reason the results of my empirical analysis alongside the analysis of others provide solid evidence as to the strong possibility that firms political spending may harm their bottom line over time delivered in january citizens united held that corporations and unions may spend

in his review professor hadani cites the following findings from various studies the results indicate that both firms year to year political spending and across year speeding had a negative effect on firms market value firms spending more on donations to politicians had a lower market worth further firms spending more on donations to politicians had no effect on their return on sales taken together the large scale analysis results indicate that firms donations to politicians are not effective in promoting firms outcomes and indeed may harm them the idea that investors may be penalized by firms political activity has received more support a recently published study by professor michael hadani at long island university and a working paper by professor john coates at the harvard law school both indicate that shareholders are not in favor of firms corporate political activity these studies show that firms that reduce shareholder power are more politically active and that shareholder equity ownership is lower for politically active firms in comparison to that of non politically active firms other research supports the notion that firms political activity hurts shareholders since it hurts firms performance echoing the above findings of the large scale analysis specifically the work of professors rajesh aggarwal felix meschke and tracy wang at the carlson school of management shows that donating money to politicians reduces firm value again shareholders may be hurt by firms political spending the proponents recognize that there are other academic studies that come to the opposite conclusion but we remain concerned that the above literature review indicates that some political campaign spending does not necessarily enhance shareholder value and in certain cases could harm it given the risks inherent to this type of spending and the ambiguity around its financial benefits the proponent believes target should protect shareholder value by refraining from such spending the proposal would not curtail the companys ability to engage in the political process ending political contributions from the corporate treasury would assuredly not prevent target from participating in the political process or expressing its views to policy makers this proposal would not eliminate pac or most types of lobbying expenditures which among most corporations are typically much larger than political spending from the corporate treasury anyway or the ability of employees to participate in the political process in a personal capacity submission

murphy secretary securities and exchange commission committee on disclosure of corporate political spending petition for rulemaking august file no october emphasis added the only lobbying expenditures that would be curtailed would be spending on referenda a growing number of companies are making the decision to refrain from types of political spending given the growing consumer sentiment opposing corporate influence over the political process and an increased recognition of the associated risks an increasing number of companies are refraining from political campaign spending according to media reports the reasons companies are making the determination to refrain from certain political spending is varied some major corporations such as pfizer and ups have taken the position that they will not use corporate funds directly either for independent expenditures or for electioneering communications the reasons for this abnegation include the following a desire to avoid being constantly battered on all sides for campaign funds by activists associated with candidates or causes a desire to avoid being caught up in the intensely partisan nature of our current electoral battles and to present a non partisan face to national constituencies across the political spectrum a lack of skill in political advertising and an understanding that corporate funds may be more effectively spent developing and advocating public policy positions after elections in the congress the executive the regulatory agencies and the courts a recent study by the sustainable investments institute documented an increase in the number of companies that assert they do not spend on politics overall the study found companies in the fall of up from a year earlier have some type of explicit prohibition companies make no contributions to candidatesthis number has doubled growing from companies last year companies refrain from giving to political parties an increase from in companies reject spending on ballot initiatives up from just one in companies prohibit contributions to s up from nine the report acknowledged that there can be a disconnect between company policy and actions

expenditures benchmark report on sp companies sustainable investments institute and irrc institute november the proponents contend that this clearly demonstrates that there is growing momentum toward avoiding some types of expenditures all together as a result we urge target to take leadership on this issue and refrain from political spending in its entirety conclusion targets own experience in demonstrates that political spending can result in risks to the companys brand and bottom line in this election year there is a heightened focus on the role of corporate money in politics and it is exceedingly difficult to determine what contributions may be perceived as controversial therefore the only way to eliminate the risk is to refrain from all political spending with treasury funds in its opposition statement target acknowledges that it embarked on a thorough review of its policies and practices in this area after its experience in and has subsequently revised its policies the proponent appreciates that the company has had thoughtful and deliberate discussions on how to best respond to the contribution controversy but contends that because contributions are allowed risk still exists furthermore as the academic research provides growing evidence that corporate political spending does not advance shareholder value and as more and more companies reject such spending the
