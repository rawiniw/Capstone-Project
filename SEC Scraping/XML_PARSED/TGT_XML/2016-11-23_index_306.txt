markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of october our credit ratings were as follows creditratingsmoodysstandardandpoorsfitchlong term debta aa commercial paperp a f if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above we have additional liquidity through a committed billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october that expires in october this new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in october no balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during or most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related

additionally at october no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade

abstract new accounting pronouncements in may the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic this asu is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services we must adopt the standard no later than the first quarter of which begins on february we do not plan to early adopt the standard companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the standard while we are still evaluating the standard including our adoption method we do not expect the standard to materially affect our consolidated net income financial position or cash flows in february the fasb issued asu no leases the new standard requires lessees to record assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement we must adopt the standard no later than the first quarter of which begins on february a modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements while we are still evaluating the standard we plan to early adopt the standard during the second half of our ability to early adopt is contingent on system readiness including software procured from third party providers while we continue to assess all potential impacts we believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for retail store and office space real estate leases which will be recorded as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet upon adoption we do not believe the new standard will have a notable impact on our liquidity the
