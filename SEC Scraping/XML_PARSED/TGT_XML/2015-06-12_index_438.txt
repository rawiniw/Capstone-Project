value as determined in good faith by the committee of the consideration to be received per share by the shareholders of the company upon the occurrence of the fundamental change d reduction in awards when applicable anything in this plan to the contrary notwithstanding the provisions of this section d shall apply to a participant if an independent auditor selected by the committee the auditor determines that each of x and y below are applicable x payments or distributions hereunder determined without application of this section d either alone or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to the participant which are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the company or otherwise but after any elimination or reduction of such payments under the terms of the companys officer income continuance policy statement as amended would result in any portion of the payments hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under section of the code y the excise tax imposed on the participant under section of the code on excess parachute payments from whatever source would result in a lesser net aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the participant after subtraction of the excise tax than if payments and distributions to the participant were reduced to the maximum amount that could be made without incurring the excise tax reduced amount under this section d the payments and distributions under this plan shall be reduced but not below zero so that the present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the reduced amount the reduced amount which may be zero shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of payments and distributions under this plan which can be made without causing any such payment to be subject to the excise tax under section of the code the determinations and reductions under this section d shall be made after eliminations or reductions if any have been made under the companys officer income continuance policy statement as amended procedure if the auditor determines that this section d is applicable to a participant it shall so advise the committee in writing the committee shall then promptly give the participant notice to that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such determination which shall include a statement of the reduced amount such notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the awards shall be eliminated or reduced as long as their aggregate present value equals the reduced amount for purposes of this section d awards shall be reduced in the following order options with an exercise price above the then fair market value of a share of common stock that have a positive value for purposes of section g of the code as determined under applicable irs guidance pro rata among awards that constitute deferred compensation subject to code section a and if a further reduction is necessary to reach the reduced amount among the awards that are not subject to code section a present value shall be determined in accordance with code section g all the foregoing determinations made by the auditor under this section d shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that excess parachute payments as defined in section g of the code will be made to the participant if an elimination or reduction is not made as promptly as practicable the company shall provide to or for the benefit of the participant such amounts and shares as are then due to the participant under this plan and shall promptly provide to or for the benefit of the participant in the future such amounts and shares as become due to the participant under this plan corrections as a result of the uncertainty in the application of section g of the code at the time of the initial determination by the auditor hereunder it is possible that payments or distributions under this plan will have been made which should not have been made overpayment or that additional payments or distributions which will have not been made could have been made underpayment in each case consistent with the calculation of the reduced amount hereunder in the event that the auditor based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the internal revenue service against the company or the participant which the auditor believes has a high probability of success determines that an overpayment has been made any such overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the participant which the participant shall repay together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f of the code provided however that no amount shall be payable by the participant if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to the excise tax under section of the code in the event that the auditor based upon controlling precedent determines that an underpayment has occurred any such underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of the participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f a of the code non cash benefits in making its determination under this section d the value of any non cash benefit shall be determined by the auditor in accordance with the principles of section g d of the code determinations binding all determinations made by the auditor under this section d shall be binding upon the company the committee and the participant plan participation and service provider status status as a service provider shall not be construed as a commitment that any award will be made under the plan to that service provider or to eligible service providers generally nothing in the plan or in any agreement or related documents shall confer upon any service provider or

terminate the persons service at any time with or without cause or change such persons compensation other benefits job responsibilities or title provided in compliance with applicable local laws and permitted under the terms of participants employment contract if any tax withholding the company or any subsidiary as applicable shall have the right to i withhold from any cash payment made under the
