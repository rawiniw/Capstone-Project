establish strong company management systems step identify and assess risk in the supply chain step design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks step carry out independent third party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply chain step report on supply chain due diligence our implementation of the oecd due diligence guidance for is discussed below due

conflict minerals ruleand the oecd due diligence guidance some of the due diligence measures discussed below are not expressly required by the oecd due diligence guidance step establish strong company management systems we adopted a policy relating to the sourcing of tg the conflict minerals policy the conflict minerals policy publicly available at https corporate target com corporate responsibility responsible sourcing social compliance labor and human rights is described in the formsd that includes this conflict minerals report as an exhibit the leadership of target sourcing services which is the sourcing operation for targets owned and exclusive brand products was responsible for implementing the compliance program target sourcing services designated dedicated employees referred to as team members to supervise the program and received support from other team members for additional corporate functions in compliance finance internal audit legal risk assessment and communications the leadership of target sourcing services received regular updates regarding our tg compliance program all team members with a compliance function within target sourcing services are given training on the conflict minerals ruleand our tg compliance program other team members within target sourcing services are also informed about the conflict minerals rulesand our policy with respect to sourcing products that might contain tg the training materials remain available for review by team members who have questions selected team members also participated in conferences benchmarking and workshops relating to the conflict minerals rule we supplemented our internal compliance team with outside professionals we engaged a third party source intelligence the service provider to collect and aggregate data from vendors to complement our own internal management processes we also retained specialist outside legal counsel to assist with our compliance efforts we used the conflict minerals reporting template developed by the electronic industry citizenship coalition and the global e sustainability initiative the conflict minerals reporting template to obtain information from our vendors concerning the sources of the tg used by them and other information concerning their compliance activities in addition we are a founding executive committee member of the retail industry leaders association conflict minerals program a multi year program that helps retailers navigate the issue the compliance requirements and solutions through a combination of educational materials benchmarking implementation tools and key partnerships as part of the retail industry leaders association conflict minerals program we developed common approaches for determining the source and chain of custody of tg and worked with business for social responsibility to develop training for our vendors we communicated our sourcing expectations relating to tg to vendors through direct communications information posted on our vendor website and online training additionally vendors were provided with an email address at target where they could direct any questions about our tg compliance program or conflict minerals policy as part of our engagement efforts we communicated to all owned and exclusive brand vendors that target would no longer accept any products that contained tg from the drc or an adjoining country unless the tg could be verified as coming from a conflict free smelter our existing integrity hotline was designated as a mechanism for team members vendors and other interested parties to be able to report violations of the conflict minerals policy we also adopted a policy requiring the maintenance of our tg related records for a minimum of five years on a computerized database and requested that the service provider store records in its possession on our behalf to comply with this policy the service provider on our behalf sent communications to our vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in the included merchandise categories concerning the requirements of the conflict minerals ruleand our tg compliance program including instructions on how to complete the conflict minerals reporting template through the service provider vendors also were offered access to a vendor education portal and email addresses and telephone numbers for questions and guidance for responding to our information requests in addition all vendors and factories that produce owned and exclusive brand products for us are required to participate in our broader social compliance program the program requires those vendors to register all applicable facilities with our social compliance team indicating the locations of facilities additionally every facility and vendor where owned and exclusive brand production takes place must authorize unannounced compliance audits through our broader social compliance program we have the right if deemed necessary to conduct unannounced spot checks of vendors who may have produced products that contain tg and have access to their documentation step identify and assess risks in the supply chain in order to obtain a broader view of tg in our supply chain we decided to send the conflict minerals reporting template to each of our owned and exclusive brand vendors in any merchandise category with any products that we determined might contain tg regardless of whether the products of that particular vendor were believed to contain tg and regardless of whether we contracted to manufacture those products we took this approach because we believed that for very few vendors if any would have the ability to report on tg usage at an individual product level we identified merchandise categories with products that might contain tg through a process involving our internal product development team and input from our service provider based on its experience with other retailers and other industries we did not filter out vendors or products in the included merchandise categories prior to sending the conflict minerals reporting templates for a list of merchandise categories we determined might include some products that were covered by the conflict minerals rule see section product status summary the service provider sent reminders to each non responsive vendor requesting that they register with the service providers system and complete our conflict minerals reporting template if a vendor continued to be non responsive the service provider was required to notify us our personnel followed up with the non responsive vendors requesting the vendors participation if a vendor who used tg in its manufacturing process did not identify the smelters or refiners of tg in its conflict minerals reporting template the service provider attempted to obtain information about the suppliers of tg for the vendors products by making inquiries of the vendors identified suppliers follow up inquiries were made by the service provider to vendors to address other incomplete responses or where vendors indicated sources of their tg that were unknown to the service provider if an entity identified as a smelter or refiner by a vendor was confirmed by the service provider to be a smelter or refiner the service provider examined whether the smelter or refiner was certified as conflict free by the conflict free sourcing initiative the cfsi the london bullion market association the lbma or the responsible jewelry council the rjc if the identified smelter or refiner was not certified by one of these independent third parties the service provider attempted to directly contact the smelter or refiner to gain more information about its sourcing practices step design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks summaries of vendor responses were provided to the leadership of target sourcing services under our internal procedures if a vendor response indicates that a product we contracted to manufacture contained tg from the drc or an adjoining country that was not verified as coming from a conflict free smelter leadership of target sourcing services will be notified and the vendor contacted under our internal procedures purchases of the identified product will be suspended until the vendor could locate a source of tg that can either be verified as coming from a conflict free smelter or is not from the drc or an adjoining country we will track any future violations of our policy by the vendor who supplied the identified product and stop doing business with the vendor if it is unwilling or unable to comply with our policy based on vendor responses for no notifications were required under these procedures step carry out independent third party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points in the supply chain in connection with our due diligence we used information made available by the cfsp lbma and rjc concerning their independent third party audits of smelters and refiners step report on supply chain due diligence we filed a formsd and this conflict minerals report with the securities and exchange commission in addition we included information on our conflict minerals policy and tg compliance program in our annual corporate responsibility report product information we do not do any direct business with any smelters or refiners of tg so we have limited influence over them as a downstream company which means a company between the smelter or refiner and the consumer we must rely on our vendors to provide accurate reliable information about tg in our supply chain and on industry efforts to influence smelters and refiners we also believe that in most cases we are several or more vendor tiers removed from the smelters and refiners of tg used in our products in addition most of the vendors for our owned and exclusive brand products are private companies which are not otherwise required to comply with the conflict minerals rule due to these challenges of tracing in a multi tier supply chain we were unable to determine the origin of tg at an individual product level for any of our owned and exclusive brand products for however as discussed under due diligence program execution we requested and received information from vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in the included merchandise categories concerning the source of the tg in all of their products as a whole regardless of whether we sourced or contracted to manufacture any products from them that contained tg for a list of merchandise categories we determined might include some products that were covered by the conflict minerals rule see section product status summary in connection with our due diligence unique smelters and refiners were identified by our vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in the included merchandise categories as being part of the vendors supply chains of those unique smelters and refiners were indicated as not sourcing tg from the drc region were certified as conflict free by an independent third party and was indicated as sourcing from the drc or an adjoining country but its facility was certified as conflict free by an independent third party all of the summarized smelter and refiner information was furnished to us by vendors based on all of their products as a whole instead of being limited to the specific products supplied to us as a result we do not know whether all of the identified smelters and refiners were actually in our supply chain in addition even if those smelters and refiners were in our supply chain not all of the tg processed by those smelters and refiners that may have been contained in our products was necessary to the functionality or production of products that we contracted to manufacture only products that we manufacture or contract to manufacture that contain tg that is necessary to the functionality or production of the products is subject to disclosure under the conflict minerals rule the certification status of the summarized conflict free smelters and refiners is as of april and is based solely on the status as made publicly available by the independent third party without our independent verification steps taken since end of period we expect to take the following additional steps in to mitigate the risk that our necessary in scope tg benefit armed groups continuing to promote industry based efforts to educate our vendors on the conflict minerals ruleand related compliance measures based on the results of our inquiries and due diligence for adopt and implement additional risk management procedures that among other things address vendor non responsiveness and non compliance include provisions relating to tg sourcing into the standard terms and conditions pertaining to our vendor contracts and purchase orders encourage vendors to provide product level information for through ongoing outreach with our vendors engage with vendors that provided incomplete responses or that did not provide responses for to help ensure that they provide requested information for and monitor and encourage the continuing development and progress of traceability measures for vendors that indicated for that the source of tg was unknown or could not be determined forward looking statements this conflict minerals report contains forward looking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include our expected refinements to our tg compliance program all such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are a the implementation of satisfactory traceability and other compliance measures by our direct and indirect vendors on a timely basis or at all b changes in the conflict minerals ruleand other political and regulatory developments relating to the sourcing of tg whether in the drc or its adjoining countries the united states or elsewhere and c those factors set forth in our description of risk factors in item a to our form k for the fiscal year ended february which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this conflict
