preparation and distribution costs and other third party administrative expenses fully benefit responsive investment contracts as described in fair value accounting standards investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits of a defined contribution plan attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts because contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan the plan invests in two synthetic guaranteed investment contracts gics gics are investment contracts in which the plan owns the underlying assets and purchases contracts from independent third parties that provide market value and cash flow risk protection to the plan as required by fair value accounting standards the statement of net assets available for benefits presents the fair value of the gics as well as the difference between the gics fair value and contract value or the adjustment to contract value the gics underlying assets are measured at fair value in accordance with fair value accounting standards the fair value of the fully benefit responsive wrapper contracts is the replacement cost of those contracts the gics contract value represents the sum of participants contributions and earnings on the underlying assets less participants withdrawals and administrative expenses reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to

differ significantly from those estimates fair value measurements in the first quarter of the plan adopted fair value accounting standards these standards define fair value for financial assets and liabilities establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosure requirements about fair value measurements fair value accounting standards define fair value as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable willing parties assets recorded at fair value are categorized using defined hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to valuation of an asset level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets level observable inputs available at the measurement date other than quoted prices included in level and level unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized based upon the lowest level of

contracts the gics are fully benefit responsive and involve two separate insurance companies contributions to this fund are invested in a portfolio of high quality short and intermediate term u s bonds including u s government treasuries corporate debt securities and other high credit quality asset backed securities the gic issuers are contractually obligated to repay the principal and a specified interest rate that is guaranteed to the plan there are no reserves against contract values for credit risk of the contract issuers or otherwise the two wrap contracts in which the fund has entered are with insurance companies under which the insurance companies provide guarantees with respect to the return of funds to make distributions from this investment option these insurance contracts are carried at contract value in the participants accounts participant accounts in the fund are credited with interest at a fixed rate that is evaluated monthly the primary variables affecting the future crediting rates include the current yield of the assets underlying the contract the duration of the assets underlying the contracts and the existing difference between the fair value of the securities and the contract value of the assets within the insurance contract the crediting rate of security backed contracts will track current market yields on a trailing basis the rate reset allows the contract value to converge with the fair value of the underlying portfolio over time assuming the portfolio continues to earn the current yield for a period of time equal to the current portfolio duration to the extent that the underlying portfolio has unrealized and or realized losses a positive adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value under contract value accounting as a result the future crediting rate may be lower over time than the current market rates similarly if the underlying portfolio generates unrealized and or realized gains a negative adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value and in the future the target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued december the stable value fund continued crediting rate may be higher than the current market rates the insurance contracts cannot credit an interest rate that is less than certain events limit the ability of the plan to transact at contract value with the insurance company such events are limited to premature termination of the contracts by the plan or plan termination the plan administrator has not expressed any intention to take either of these actions the wrapper contracts cannot be terminated by the issuers of the contracts at a value other than contract value except under a limited number of specific circumstances including termination of the plan or failure to qualify under specific tax code provisions material misrepresentations by the plan administrator or investment manager failure by these same parties to meet material obligations under the contract or other similar types of events as described in note because the gics are fully benefit responsive contract value is the relevant measurement attribute
