directors is determined by the board with a minimum of and a maximum of directors all directors are elected annually and as is the case this year where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected directors are elected under a majority voting standard this means that each director must receive more votes for his or her election than votes against in order to be elected if an incumbent director fails to receive a sufficient number of votes to be elected he or she must promptly offer to resign and the nominating governance committee will make a recommendation on the offer and the board must accept or reject the offer within days and publicly disclose its decision and rationale nomination process the nominating governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members and making recommendations on director nominees to the full board the committee uses the board membership criteria set forth in our governance guidelines when evaluating director candidates under these criteria the committee seeks director candidates that have broad perspective experience knowledge and independence of judgment the committee also reviews the backgrounds skills and experiences of existing directors to identify complementary attributes to seek in new director candidates the committee does not have a specific policy regarding consideration of gender ethnic or other diversity criteria in identifying candidates however the board has had a longstanding commitment to and practice of maintaining diverse representation on the board the nominating governance committee will consider a recommendation by a shareholder of a candidate for election as a target director any shareholder who wishes the committee to consider a candidate should submit a written request and related information to our corporate secretary no later than december of the calendar year preceding the next annual meeting of shareholders nominees for director after considering the recommendations of the nominating governance committee the board has set the number of directors at and nominated the persons described below to stand for election all nominees are incumbent directors the board believes that each of these nominees is qualified to serve as a director of target and the specific qualifications of each nominee that were considered by the board are set forth following each nominee s biographical description equally as important the board believes that the combination of backgrounds skills and experiences has produced a board that is well equipped to exercise oversight responsibilities for target s shareholders and other stakeholders specifically all nominees have strong business backgrounds with eight nominees having ceo experience in complex business organizations all nominees have senior management level experience with multinational enterprises an area of increased importance as we expand our retail operations outside of the united states five nominees have expertise in consumer marketing an area critical to our continued success as a leading retail brand five nominees have significant experience in financial matters which provides valuable perspective in connection with our investment of capital in our retail operations real estate and financial services assets and the overall composition represents a balanced approach to director tenure allowing the board to benefit from the experience of longer serving directors combined with fresh perspectives from newer directors four nominees have served for more than ten years six nominees have served for five to ten years and one nominee has served for less than five years we have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling for good cause to serve if elected however if any nominee should become unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a

general information about the board of directors and corporate governance director independence the board of directors believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent

target that director is not independent the listing standards of the new york stock exchange nyse set forth certain relationships that if present preclude a finding of independence the board affirmatively determined that all non management directors are independent mr steinhafel is the only management director and is not independent in making this determination the board specifically considered the following transactions all of which were entered into in the ordinary course of business for mr stumpf the payments by target to wells fargo for commercial banking brokerage trust and equipment financing services and commitment fees for wells fargo s role as a non lead participant in target s syndicated revolving credit facility target s total payments to wells fargo amounted to

directors met five times during fiscal all directors attended at least of the aggregate total of meetings of the board and board committees on which the director served during the last fiscal year all directors attended our june annual meeting of shareholders the board has a policy requiring all directors to attend all annual meetings of shareholders absent extraordinary circumstances board leadership structure the board is led by mr steinhafel in his role as chairman mr steinhafel is also the chief executive officer the board also has designated a lead independent director position to complement the chairman s role and to serve as the principal liaison between the non management directors and the chairman the board continues to believe that its current structure is the appropriate one for target at this time specifically the board believes that in light of target s clear strategy and the strength of its overall governance practices a combined chairman ceo role will more effectively unify the board and management around the specific initiatives to support target s strategy the board continues to separately evaluate mr steinhafel annually in each of his roles and it has retained the discretion to separate the chairman ceo roles at any time if the board believes it would better serve the interests of target the board also concluded that its lead independent director position effectively balances any risk of concentration of authority that may exist with a combined chairman ceo position mr johnson is our lead independent director as lead director mr johnson presides at all meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present including executive sessions of non management directors conducts the annual performance

management development and succession planning activities to maximize the pool of internal candidates who can assume top management positions without undue interruption in addition the board has adopted a ceo emergency succession policy to govern unforeseen succession needs risk oversight the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management the board s oversight of these risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the board s oversight of our business for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the board s regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with this strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and discusses with our senior executive officers the major events activities and challenges affecting their respective functional areas the board s ongoing oversight of risk in the context of specific aspects of our business is supplemented by periodic reviews of our enterprise risk management process which facilitates consideration of our overall strategic objectives risk exposures and risk management programs in a holistic fashion the oversight of risks also occurs at the board committee level on a more focused basis as described in the description of each committee s responsibilities compensation policies and risk as part of our regular review of our compensation practices we conducted an analysis of whether our compensation policies and practices create material risks to the company the results of this analysis were reviewed by the compensation committee s independent consultant and discussed with the compensation committee which agreed with management s conclusion that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company more specifically this conclusion was based on the following considerations pay mix compensation mix of base salary short term and long term incentives provides compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our incentive structure with near term and long term strategic goals performance metrics a variety of performance metrics are used in both the short term and long term incentive plans this portfolio approach to performance metrics encourages focus on sustained overall company performance additional detail on our performance metrics can be found in the compensation discussion and analysis performance goals goals are approved by our independent directors and take into account our historical performance current strategic initiatives and the expected macroeconomic environment in addition short term and long term incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves and leverage that support our pay for performance philosophy equity incentives equity incentive programs and stock ownership guidelines are designed to align management and shareholder interests by providing vehicles for executive officers to accumulate and maintain an ownership position in the company risk mitigation policies we incorporate several risk mitigation policies into our officer compensation program including the compensation committee s ability to use negative discretion to determine appropriate payouts under formula based plans a clawback policy to recover incentive compensation that was based on inaccurate financial statements and stock ownership guidelines for executive officers supplemented with an anti hedging policy committees the board has the following committees and committee composition all of whom are independent

following compensation discussion and analysis with management based on this review and discussion the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in our annual report on form k and this proxy statement compensation committee james a johnson chair calvin darden mary n dillon stephen w sanger compensation discussion and analysis executive summary our compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that delivers outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term we pursue this alignment with shareholders through a pay for performance philosophy in which variable compensation represents a majority of an executive officer s potential compensation a balance of short and long term performance metrics and sound governance the chart below demonstrates that our performance has resulted in returns to target shareholders that over the and year time horizons has outpaced the median of our retail peer group as defined on page total shareholder return data source bloomberg total shareholder return period ending january in addition to our results shown above our sales market share and eps performance versus our company retail peer group including target for the last three years has outpaced the median of our retail peer group as outlined in our long term incentive performance on page we ranked thof the companies in sales market share growth and ndin eps growth for the three year period ended with fiscal turning to our most recent results target s full year fiscal financial results reflect the ability of our team to manage our businesses in a volatile environment we delivered diluted gaap earnings per share eps of up percent from fiscal adjusted eps for fiscal which we report as a measure of the performance of our u s businesses was up percent from a year ago a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on pages of our annual report on form k for fiscal u s retail comparable store sales grew by percent our best annual performance since fiscal this growth reflects investments made in our remodel program and redcard rewards loyalty program both of which continue to drive incremental traffic and sales our team very effectively managed the profitability of our retail sales largely offsetting the gross margin pressure from our sales driving initiatives with expense leverage keeping our operating expense rates in line with our goal and past performance while maintaining strong service levels in our stores this disciplined focus allowed us to replicate the high ebitda performance we achieved in fiscal and fiscal our u s credit card segment achieved outstanding results managing our receivables portfolio generating outstanding profitability on a planned decline in the asset base with a pretax return on our investment in the portfolio of strong cash generation combined with a strong balance sheet allowed us to return billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase representing more than of our net income for the year compensation decisions for our executive officers including the named executive officers neos in fiscal as detailed on page reflect this backdrop of continued strong performance and execution of our strategy base pay levels reflect modest increases except where appropriate to reflect expanded responsibilities our fiscal results produced short term incentive compensation that was at goal and long term incentive award values were largely consistent with awards in fiscal except where appropriate to recognize an executive officer for expanded responsibilities and or exceptional contributions in fiscal in broad terms our compensation programs for executive officers focus on clear and consistent pay for performance criteria and reflect the competitive environment in which we operate more specifically we establish short term incentive payout levels to provide an opportunity for compensation payments in the upper quartile of the marketplace when financial performance goals are exceeded and for significantly reduced compensation when our financial performance is below expectations incorporate a mix of variable cash and equity compensation elements with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance this approach aligns with shareholder interests by focusing on shareholder value creating performance measures such as market share earnings per share eps earnings before interest and taxes ebit and economic value added eva provide a competitive package of long term pay at risk and time vested equity compensation and retirement plans to facilitate retention and provide opportunities to realize future value aligned with shareholders in addition we continued our focus on sound corporate governance in our pay practices by conducting an annual compensation risk assessment reviewed by the board s independent compensation consultant semler brossy consulting group sbcg maintaining stock ownership guidelines a clawback policy and an anti hedging policy for executive officers and not providing tax gross ups to our executive officers our performance framework for executive compensation pay mix allocation our compensation programs embrace a strong pay for performance approach in which variable compensation also referred to as pay at risk represents a majority of potential total compensation in order to motivate and reward sustained outstanding performance that is aligned with shareholder interests total direct compensation tdc for our executive officers is determined by the sum of three compensation elements base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation we allocate tdc among the compensation elements by considering market data from our peer group companies this is done both by direct comparison of the amount of each element with peer group company data and also using data on the relative weightings of different elements by our peer companies this market data is used to establish a range for each element that becomes a reference point to determine a final compensation allocation that is in line with market conditions yet maintains a strong bias in favor of long term and performance linked compensation the chart below illustrates how base salary short term incentives and long term incentives comprised of stock options performance share units psus and restricted stock units rsus were allocated to create the fiscal tdc pay mix at goal for our ceo and other neos ceo pay mix other neos pay mix pay mix components our compensation programs use a combination of performance measures with both short annual and long term time horizons to provide a balanced assessment of performance and risk over time and support our financial and strategic objectives element measure metric objective base salary experience scope of role reflective of the scope and complexity of our executive officer s roles their individual skills contribution and tenure with our company short term incentive earnings designed to reinforce our focus on profitability as measured by ebit investment discipline designed to evaluate the degree to which capital is being efficiently invested through measuring eva balancing profitability with capital investments personal performance recognizes additional critical factors that are based on subjective management criteria including the executive officer s ability to develop a high performing team their ability to lead strategic priorities and their demonstration of a strong commitment to high ethical standards long term incentive psus market share designed to incent continued market share gains by measuring the domestic net sales growth captured relative to peers over a three year period eps focuses on achieving sufficiently high growth in eps relative to peers over a sustained period three years long term incentives rsus stock options and psus stock price we believe that consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in stock priceas such the value of equity based compensation vehicles is directly tied to our stock price and our shareholders value assessment pay for performance link we establish challenging goals for our company and our team as outlined on page we have consistently set goals and achieved results above prior years levels for pay positioning we determine tdc using at goal levels of payouts commonly referred to as target levels of performance in other words we assume at goal payout levels for determining target level payouts under our short term incentive program and the value of psu awards all equity awards are valued at their grant date fair value for purposes of determining tdc the actual tdc earned by each executive officer will vary significantly depending on both company and their individual performance the following chart highlights the variability of our compensation by showing fiscal tdc at goal and the value of the tdc package for our ceo one year later with two different performance scenarios above goal performance reflecting ebit and eva results at above goal with stock price appreciation for the year and below goal performance reflecting ebit and eva results at below goal with stock price depreciation ceo tdc variability our other neos tdc packages exhibita similar level of variability with this backdrop the remainder of this section discusses in greater detail each component of tdc determining tdc when determining executive officer tdc many factors are considered to ensure the packages are in line with our pay for performance philosophy while remaining competitive in the market for talent we consider individual factors such as performance experience internal comparisons and compensation history peer group market positioning is another important factor considered in determining each executive officer s tdc as discussed on pages due to imprecise comparability of executive officer positions between companies peer group market position is used as a reference point in the tdc determination process rather than a formula driven outcome the following considerations are utilized when determining executive officer tdc packages that have been established at levels above the median of our peer groups and for more experienced executive officers including all of the neos at levels that are in the upper quartile of these peer groups job scopethe job scope of our executive officers is broad and complex we maintain a flat organizational structure resulting in greater executive officer involvement and insight into the business which leads to high performance expectations of our executive officers we also have vertical integration where we manage our own international sourcing operations directly import a significant percentage of our inventory and develop and manage our large portfolio of owned brand offerings in addition we have supply chain complexity with the variety of categories we offer in our stores from perishable food products to apparel and linens to electronics and movies to pharmacies further complexities include our u s credit card segment and international expansion which resulted in our canadian segment sizewith respect to the retail peer group in all metrics and for our general industry peer group with respect to revenue and number of employees we are among the largest of our peer companies pay at riskpay at risk short term and long term incentive compensation represents a higher percentage of tdc for our executive officers in comparison to our retail and general industry peer groups for our ceo and other neos and of tdc is pay at risk respectivelyaligning pay with our financial and or stock price performance our executive officers are accountable for and compensated based on our performance and the functions that they manage when our performance is strong payouts will be higher conversely when our performance is weak payouts will be lower talentwe seek to attract and retain the best available management talent to protect and advance the iconic target brand long term performanceas illustrated in the chart on page our total shareholder return over the and year time horizons has outpaced the median of our retail peer group all five of our neos have been officers of our company over the year time horizon four of the five have been executive officers since at least and have had a direct impact on our long term performance base salary based on the rationale described above we have established base salaries at levels above the median levels of our peer groups and for more experienced executive officers including all of the neos at levels that are in the upper quartile of these peer groups specific actions in the current year related to base salaries for neos who received increases of more than were an increase for ms tesija for increased responsibilities over our multichannel initiatives an increase for mr scully for his expanded responsibilities over our shared service operations short term incentives incentive opportunities under our short term incentive compensation program are based on percentages of an executive officer s base salary that are tied to objective financial performance measures used under the program and for executive officers other than our ceo their subjectively determined personal performance level for at goal performance the ceo short term incentive pays of base salary and for executive officers of base salary see table below the performance measures are as follows profitability incentive ebit incentive ebit is one of two financial performance measures for payments under our annual short term incentive program this measurement is designed to reinforce our focus on the growth in our earnings before interest and taxes and accounts for of the financial component of the short term incentive payout incentive ebit is u s retail ebit plus u s credit spread to libor see credit spread to libor definition and discussion in item of our annual report on form k because the majority of our credit card receivables portfolio earns interest based on a variable interest rate changes in interest rates affect finance charge revenues that in turn affect reported ebit accordingly we adjust ebit to generally eliminate the effect of interest rate fluctuations either up or down on short term incentive payout calculations in establishing the goal for fiscal the compensation committee determined to exclude the canadian segment results as those results consist solely of start up costs incurred during the performance period investment discipline incentive eva incentive eva is the other financial performance measure for payments under our annual short term incentive program and accounts for the other of the financial component of the short term incentive payout incentive eva is a measure of earnings after an estimated after tax cost of capital charge and is used to evaluate the degree to which capital is being efficiently invested the effective tax rate used to calculate incentive eva is fixed to prevent future tax volatility from having an unintended effect on payouts a positive incentive eva performance indicates we are generating returns on invested capital at rates higher than the cost of capital among other things our use of incentive eva helps us temper the objective of increasing revenues through new store construction with a measure of how profitably we are investing in new stores in calculating incentive eva we use an annualized after tax blended cost of debt and equity capital of for capital used to fund our core retail operations and approximately for capital used to fund our credit card operations consistent with our calculation for incentive ebit our canadian segment results were excluded from fiscal incentive eva by design personal performanceall executive officers are eligible to earn a personal performance payment for all executive officers other than our ceo personal performance payments correspond to a predetermined percentage of their base salary tied to a payout matrix for each personal performance review score the maximum personal performance payout is equal to of an executive officer s base salary our ceo does not receive a personal performance payment under this program but he may receive a personal performance payment outside of the program at the board s discretion the following tables summarize the total short term incentive opportunity for financial performance measures at below goal goal and above goal and a representative incentive opportunity for the personal performance aspect of the short term incentive program under various performance levels as a percent of base pay illustrative

excellent personal performance reflects financial performance at above goal and outstanding personal performance the short term incentive program provides for an annual maximum incentive opportunity of of base salary for each executive officer and occurs at performance levels more than above goal short term incentive payouts have varied significantly based on our financial performance over the last five years the following chart illustrates short term incentive payouts in relation to goal payouts from fiscal to fiscal for our ceo ceo short term incentive history financial componentincentive

below goal respectively the following chart summarizes historical performance as well as fiscal financial performance versus goal incentive ebit dollars in millions incentive eva dollars in millions personal componentreview scores which determine payouts for the personal performance component of our short term incentive program for our executive officers other than the ceo are based on subjective management criteria including the executive officer s ability to develop a high performing team their ability to lead strategic priorities and their demonstration of a strong commitment to high ethical standards we include this subjective element within our mix of variable compensation elements to recognize the critical factors upon which we believe their leadership and performance should be judged but which are not quantifiable or linked to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the compensation committee approved our ceo s recommended personal review scores for the other executive officers ceo discretionary awardthe board awarded mr steinhafel a discretionary short term incentive payment for personal performance in the amount of million for fiscal compared to an award of million in fiscal the primary purpose of the award amount for fiscal was to recognize his personal performance as chief executive officer in leading our company in delivering record eps in fiscal in a challenging environment and making significant progress on our strategic initiatives including our expansion into canada the success of our remodel program and redcard rewards loyalty program initiatives and their contribution to our profitability we believe those strategic initiatives will drive value to shareholders over short and long term time horizons all personal performance payments are reported in the bonus column of the summary compensation table and any payments based on financial performance measures in our short term incentive program are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation column long term incentives we believe consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in our stock price stock options psus and rsus are the variable equity instruments we use to incent our executive officers to maintain this long term focus and as a reward vehicle for their efforts if successful over the long term in addition to alignment with shareholder interests the use of multiple equity based lti award vehicles supports our pay for performance philosophy stock options provide a strong incentive for stock price appreciation as without stock price appreciation these instruments do not provide any value to the executive officer to emphasize stock price growth of the lti award value as of the grant date is delivered as stock options as psus and as rsus rsus facilitate retention and cliff vest three years from the date of grant psus focus on measures directly aligned with profitable market share growth relative to peers

consideration of his upcoming retirement ms tesija and mr scully received increased long term incentive awards to reflect additional responsibilities over our multichannel business for ms tesija and for mr scully s leadership in the successful launch of our redcard rewards program competitive market analysis the tdc levels and elements described in the preceding pages are evaluated annually for each executive officer relative to our retail and general industry peer group companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data obtained from publicly available proxy statements analyzed by semler brossy consulting group sbcg and proprietary survey data assembled by towers watson and hay group the selected retail peer group provides a cross section of general merchandise department store food and specialty retailers and includes companies that are large generally exceeding billion in revenues and meaningful competitors further our psu program detailed on pages hinges on our ability to perform successfully relative to our retail peers general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and among the leaders in their industries the composition of the peer groups is reviewed annually to ensure it is appropriate in terms of company size and business focus and any changes made are reviewed with sbcg and approved by the compensation committee both the retail and general industry peer groups for

elements we offer additional compensation elements designed to encourage retention of key talent these elements include pension planwe maintain a pension plan that covers team members that were hired prior to january and who meet certain eligibility criteria we also maintain supplemental pension plans for those team members who are subject to irs limits on the basic pension plan or whose pensions are adversely impacted by participating in our deferred compensation plan with the exception of one older supplemental plan that covers persons who have been officers since which includes our current ceo mr steinhafel our pension formula under these plans is the same for all participantsthere are no enhanced benefits provided to executive officers k and deferred compensation plan details on each of these elements of our compensation programs are provided in the tables that follow the summary compensation table beginning on page perquisites we provide certain perquisites to our executive officers principally to allow them to devote more time to our business and to promote their health and safety the compensation committee reviews these perquisites annually to ensure they are consistent with our philosophy and appropriate in magnitude the personal use of our aircraft is provided to our ceo for security reasons other perquisites are described on pages of this proxy statement employment contracts none of our executive officers including our ceo have employment contracts income continuance we have an income continuance policy icp that is provided to executive officers who are involuntarily terminated without cause because we believe it is appropriate to provide continued income to assist in their occupational transition the maximum payment under this policy paid during regular pay cycles over two years is two times the sum of base salary and the average of the last three years of short term incentive and personal performance payments compensation governance roles of compensation committee management and consultants the compensation committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of our non ceo executive officer pay packages and for developing a recommendation for our ceo s pay package that is reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full board the compensation committee receives assistance from two sources an independent compensation consulting firm sbcg and our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president of human resources sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the compensation committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target compensation recommendations for executive officers are made to the compensation committee in two separate ways with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the compensation committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the compensation committee s consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies on its understanding of target s business and compensation programs and sbcg s independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with our ceo with respect to his compensation for other executive officers our executive vice president of human resources works with our ceo to develop our ceo s compensation recommendations to the compensation committee in developing these recommendations the executive vice president of human resources provides our ceo with market data on pay levels and compensation design practices provided by management s external compensation consultant covering the peer group companies management s outside consultant does not have any interaction with either the compensation committee or our ceo but does interact with the executive vice president of human resources and her staff in addition to providing market data management s external compensation consultant performs other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation the final recommendations to the compensation committee are determined by our ceo and include a recommendation with respect to the compensation of the executive vice president of human resources importantly sbcg provides the compensation committee with sbcg s independent view of our ceo s compensation recommendations all decisions regarding executive compensation and final recommendations to the independent members of the full board are made solely by the compensation committee say on pay the compensation committee reviewed the results of the annual non binding say on pay proposal at the annual meeting of shareholders held in june our executive compensation was approved by shareholders holding a substantial majority of the shares voted on our say on pay proposal the compensation committee and our board of directors believe the results of the vote in the most recent year support our approach to executive compensation and did not indicate a need to implement any major changes to our executive compensation programs in fiscal the board will continue to carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions recoupment policy our recoupment or clawback policy which covers all officers allows for recovery of the following compensation elements all amounts paid under the short term incentive plan includes discretionary component that were paid with respect to any fiscal year that is restated and all awards under the long term incentive plan whether exercised vested unvested or deferred all demands for repayment are subject to compensation committee discretion for an officer to be subject to recovery or cancellation under this policy he or she must have engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the need for a restatement of the corporation s consolidated financial statements anti hedging policy executive officers and members of the board of directors may not directly or indirectly engage in capital transactions intended to hedge or offset the market value of target common stock owned by them policies on equity compensation general our use of equity compensation is intended to enhance the alignment of executive officer and shareholder interests and also to provide a means for our executive officers and directors to accumulate an ownership stake in target our executive officer and director stock ownership guidelines and their current ownership positions are discussed on pages of this proxy statement our compensation committee recognizes that the use of equity as a form of compensation can result in potential shareholder dilution our equity compensation awards have been granted under a shareholder approved plan our long term incentive plan on an annual basis the compensation committee reviews and approves an aggregate pool of shares that are available for grant and in doing so reviews metrics relating to both the annual grant rate and the cumulative dilutive impact of outstanding awards in addition the plan expressly prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option without shareholder approval individual grants to executive officers must be approved by the compensation committee the compensation committee has delegated authority to make grants to team members below the executive officer level to our ceo grant timing policy we have the following practices regarding the timing of equity compensation grants which includes stock option exercise price determinations these practices have not been formalized in a written policy but they are strictly observed stock options and rsus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled january compensation committee meeting psus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled march compensation committee meeting in order to align the grant date of the award with our financial goal setting process these meetings are scheduled more than one year in advance we set the exercise price of stock awards at the volume weighted average trading price of our stock on the grant date we believe that the volume weighted average price is a better measure of the fair value of our shares than the closing price on the grant date as it eliminates the effect of any variations in stock price that may occur in the final minutes of trading if the closing price were used we have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around our grant dates our information releases are handled in a process completely separate from our equity grants on occasion we make equity compensation grants outside of our

most impacted by his higher cash compensation since becoming chief executive officer an early retirement factor in the pension formula that allows all plan participants including mr steinhafel to

edcp account adjustment also occurs upon termination of employment to determine the amount of the change in actuarial equivalent lump sum amount the prior transfers are adjusted by an assumed annual earnings rate based on the rate of return of the stable value fund crediting rate alternative in edcp actuarial equivalents are determined using the discount methodology we use in calculating lump sum

to the target corporation officer short term incentive plan approved in referred to as the current stip for purposes of this item three we are seeking shareholder approval of the stip because one of the conditions for qualification as performance based compensation for u s tax purposes is that the shareholders must approve the material terms of the performance measures and re approve those material terms every five years shareholder approval of the stip will allow us to preserve the tax deduction for our performance based officer compensation payable under the stip that may otherwise exceed the deduction limit established by section m of the internal revenue code see tax matters below the purpose of the stip like our current stip is to promote our pay for performance compensation philosophy by providing cash incentive awards to designated officers who through their efforts directly and significantly impact the achievement of our goals and objectives the stip gives the compensation committee discretion to choose one or more appropriate performance measures by which to measure executive officers performance in any given performance period the performance measures are set at the beginning of each performance period summary of the plan the basic features of the stip are summarized below the stip will not become effective unless approved by the shareholders administration the compensation committee all of whose members are independent outside directors will administer the stip the compensation committee will have the authority to grant cash incentive awards upon such terms consistent with the terms of the stip as it considers appropriate to our executive officers and certain other officers the compensation committee will have authority to interpret all provisions of the stip to adopt amend and rescind rules and regulations pertaining to the administration of the stip and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the stip eligibility any executive officer designated by the compensation committee from time to time and any nonexecutive officer designated by the chief executive officer from time to time is eligible to participate in the stip for a given year or other performance period in fiscal approximately officers including executive officers were selected to participate in the current stip and participation in the stip is expected to be comparable determination of performance measures awards may be based on one or more of the following performance measures chosen by the compensation committee revenues sales comparable store sales earnings before interest and taxes earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization earnings before taxes net earnings earnings per share economic value added total shareholder return credit card spread to libor in addition for any award to a participant who is not a covered officer under section m of the internal revenue code or that is not intended to constitute performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code the performance measures may include alone or in combination with the performance measures listed above any other measure of performance as determined by the compensation committee the compensation committee may select different performance measures for different participants in any performance period the compensation committee also selects the relevant performance periods which may not exceed four consecutive fiscal quarters in addition to selecting the performance measures the compensation committee will also approve the level of attainment required to earn a payment under an award the required level of attainment can be measured as an absolute amount or relative to other periods or to a designated peer group the performance measure may be tied to performance achieved by our company or any segment subsidiary operating company division unit test strategy or new venture of our company or based on individual performance in recent years the compensation committee has selected a combination of earnings before interest and taxes ebit and economic value added eva as the performance measures for awards to our officers determination of cash incentive amounts the target opportunity for each participant will be determined by the compensation committee at the beginning of the performance period the target opportunity may be established as a set dollar amount or as a percentage of the participant s compensation typically based on a percentage of base salary in addition the compensation committee may establish an incentive pool and determine each participant s award based on a ratio of the participant s award to all awards earned under the stip multiplied by the pool at the end of the performance period the compensation committee will certify levels of achievement of the performance measures and pay out any earned awards in the form of cash payments the compensation committee has discretion to exclude the effects of extraordinary items unusual or non recurring events changes in accounting principles or methods realized investment gains or losses discontinued operations acquisitions divestitures material restructuring or impairment charges uninsured losses for natural catastrophes and any other items the committee determines is necessary to provide appropriate period to period comparisons so long as such adjustments are permissible under section m of the internal revenue code maximum payments the maximum amount payable under the stip to any participant for any year is equal to the lesser of million or of the participant s base salary as of the date of grant of the award tax matters as described in the compensation discussion and analysis in this proxy statement section m of the internal revenue code limits the deductibility of compensation paid to our covered officers to million per year this limitation does not apply to performance based compensation one of the conditions for qualification as performance based compensation is that the shareholders must approve the material terms of the performance measures and re approve those material terms every five years amounts paid under the objective performance measures established under the stip will under current tax law continue to qualify as performance based compensation if shareholders approve the stip new plan benefits the stip will be effective february so long as it is approved by shareholders prior to june as a result the first awards granted under the stip will relate to fiscal amounts payable under the stip for fiscal are not determinable because the performance measures and target opportunities will not be set by the compensation committee

exercise price calculation in column b item fouradvisory aproval of executive compensation consistent with the views expressed by shareholders at our annual meeting the board of directors has determined to seek an annual non binding advisory vote from shareholders to approve the executive compensation as disclosed in the compensation discussion analysis cda tabular disclosures and related narrative of this proxy statement target s executive compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that delivers outstanding financial results over the long term our executive compensation programs reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we incorporate a mix of cash and equity compensation with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance put an emphasis on variable compensation with financial performance measures that correlate with the creation of shareholder value and directly align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by linking long term compensation to stock price performance shareholders are urged to read the cda which discusses in depth how our executive compensation programs are aligned with our performance and the creation of shareholder value the compensation committee and the board of directors believe that the policies and practices described in the cda effectively implement our pay for performance compensation philosophy the board of directors upon recommendation of the compensation committee recommends that shareholders vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the shareholders approve the compensation awarded to the named executive officers as described in the cda tabular disclosures and other narrative executive compensation disclosures in this proxy statement effect of item the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this item by shareholders will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding target s executive compensation practices the final decision on the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board believes that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interest of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of target s shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions item fiveshareholder proposal on electronics recycling as you sow california street suite san francisco ca on behalf of shareholder margaret law who held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that target corp s board of directors prepare a report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy options above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental impacts of its electronics recycling activities by providing mechanisms for take back of all electronics sold promoting reuse of working equipment and preventing export to non oecd countries of hazardous e waste and untested or non working equipment or components supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth largest u s retailer of consumer electronics and such devices contain toxic materials such as lead mercury cadmium brominated flame retardants polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle only about of electronics ready for end of life management are collected for recycling according to a u s environmental protection agency report e waste is the fastest growing and most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream comprising more than the estimated collection rate for e waste lags the u s recovery rate for all municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental impacts analog tv sets and monitors with cathode ray tubes contain large amounts of lead flat screen monitors contain mercury switches and computer batteries contain cadmium which can be harmful to human health if released to the environment electronic goods collected for recycling in the u s are often shipped by recyclers to developing countries where they endanger health and the environment exporting harm the high tech trashing of asia a report by basel action network revealed appalling conditions in the city of guiyu china where approximately migrant workers break apart and process old electronic equipment under primitive conditions workers openly burn toxic plastics and wires and melt soldered circuit boards to extract gold silver and copper these activities threaten worker health and pollute land and water target s corporate responsibility report states being a responsible steward of the environment is one of the most important issues that defines target s corporate reputation yet the company does not offer take back for the full range of electronics it sells and lacks a policy to ensure safe disposal of materials collected the company takes back small devices such as music players and mobile phones but does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of electronics it collects or whether it promotes reuse of working equipment or bars export of collected electronics shareholders need assurances the company is actively monitoring how collected goods are processed proponents believe our company should develop a nationwide return program for all electronic devices it sells using stores or nearby locations convenient for customers all electronics collected by our company should be recycled or refurbished by responsible electronics recyclers who are independently verified to meet a standard such as the e stewards standard competitor best buy takes back all electronics and bars downstream service providers from exporting non working equipment or components to developing countries and requires third party provider audits position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders in response to a similar proposal last year we improved our disclosure with respect to our electronics recycling activities in particular we now address in more detail our responsible recycling standards for e waste our in store recycling program where our recycling products go and other efforts to divert waste from landfills at hereforgood target com environment our responsible recycling standards for e waste which we contractually obligate our vendor partners to follow address several of the concerns mentioned by the proponent those standards include ensuring that all items are refurbished broken down and recycled or marketed for re use processing all e waste items domestically and preventing e waste materials from being sent to landfills anywhere in the world monthly reporting by vendors on all sales and recycling activity which along with site audits encourages transparency and allows visibility into vendor processes our program includes consideration of whether vendors have met various certification standards such as the e stewards standard mentioned in the proposal and the responsible recycling r standard the vendors internal processes and reputation and periodic process reviews and inspections by appropriate target team members or third party inspectors the vendor responsible for the majority of target s e waste processing is independently certified to meet the r standard the proposal received this year differs from last year s proposal in that it asks us to consider expanding the scope of our guest facing recycling program to include all electronics sold our guest facing recycling program already allows guests to easily recycle small electronics such as mp players ink cartridges and cell phones as well as cans glass and plastic bottles and plastic bags in their local target store in essence the substance of the proposal is to ask us to cover larger electronics such as televisions game consoles and appliances in our guest facing recycling program we do not believe such an expansive recycling program is common among general merchandise retailers in addition we believe that the nature of a more expanded program would be disruptive to our store operations and less efficient relative to other alternatives available to guests for disposal of such items including the availability of local government run recycling facilities we do not believe a separate report is needed because we already actively monitor our recycling and disposal practices for e waste above and beyond legal compliance and our existing recycling program including our electronics take back is consistent with if not ahead of practices among general merchandise retailers based on the above the board believes that our current approach to e waste is appropriate and is in the best interest of target and our shareholders the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on electronics recycling item sixshareholder proposal on prohibiting use of corporate funds for political elections or campaigns green century equity fund state street suite boston ma which held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved the shareholders request that the board of directors adopt a policy prohibiting the use of corporate funds for any political election or campaign supporting statement prohibit political spending from corporate treasury funds whereas political spending and corporate money in politics is a highly contentious issue made more prominent in light of the citizens united supreme court case that affirmed companies rights to make unlimited political expenditures to independent groups in the election year we expect even more media and public attention to corporate spending to influence elections experts predict that an unprecedented amount of money will be spent in the election season recent polls highlight the public s disapproval in a june harris poll of voters said that corporations have too much influence over the political system today in february an abc news washington post poll found that opposed citizens united noting the bipartisan nature of these views is striking in these largely partisan times corporate political contributions can backfire on a corporation s reputation and bottom line in target corporation experienced such risks directly after it received unwanted attention consumer boycotts and protests for its support of a controversial candidate in a harris poll released in october a sizable portion of respondents indicated that if there were option they would shop elsewhere if they learned that a business they patronized had contributed to a candidate or a cause that they oppose according to the national institute on money in state politics between and target corporation spent million on company or pac contributions however this figure does not include payments to trade associations or other tax exempt organizations that may channel corporate money to political ends many trade associations that receive corporate contributions spend vast sums in electoral politics these payments are not required to be disclosed for example the u s chamber of commerce pledged to spend between and million in the election season and announced that it would work to unseat any member of congress who voted for healthcare reform according to public citizen only of groups broadcasting electioneering communications in the primary season revealed the identities of donors in their federal election commission filings down from nearly percent in the and cycles increasingly companies such as ibm colgate palmolive wells fargo and others are adopting policies prohibiting spending of political funds directly or indirectly to influence elections given the risks and potential negative impact on shareholder value the proponents believe target corporation should adopt a policy to refrain from using treasury funds in the political process we believe this policy should include any direct or indirect contribution that is intended to influence the outcome of an election or referendum it should also prohibit the use of trade associations or non profit corporations from channeling our company s contributions or membership dues to influence the outcome of any election or referendum position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders the board acknowledges the importance of the issue of the role of corporations in public policy activities following our experience during the election cycle the board conducted a comprehensive review of our policies and practices in this area which led to the adoption of a clear and transparent framework for target s public policy engagement based on alignment of our business interests and public policy activities a rigorous internal governance process including board oversight that supports this alignment and transparency to shareholders guests team members and other stakeholders during the course of this review the board considered whether to adopt a ban on the use of any corporate treasury funds for political purposes it determined that a complete prohibition of this nature was too absolute and could put target at a disadvantage if there ever were circumstances when use of corporate funds would be in the best interests of the corporation the board continues to believe that our framework for engagement which combines a sound decision making process board oversight and transparency to stakeholders is the best approach more information about our public policy activities including disclosure of individual contributions and a discussion of how we prohibit trade associations from using any of target s dues for political campaigns can be found at hereforgood target com learn more civic activity the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal
