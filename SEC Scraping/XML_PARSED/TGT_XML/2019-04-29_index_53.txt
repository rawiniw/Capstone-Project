oversight functions among management the board and its committees is as follows target corporation proxy statement back to contents the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management at the management level risks are prioritized and assigned to senior leaders based on the risks relationship to the leaders business area and focus those senior leaders develop plans to address the risks and measure the progress of risk management efforts our chief legal risk officer provides centralized oversight of

committee included in its membership the boards oversight of the risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the boards oversight of our business and seeks to ensure that management has in place processes to deal appropriately with risk for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the boards regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with that strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and discusses with

importance priorities description investing in our business fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable long term value and maintain our current operations and assets annual dividend maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually share repurchase return excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals dividend and share repurchase philosophy our business generates more cash than we currently need to fully invest in the growth and long term health of our business so we return excess cash to shareholders through an appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase we believe that both dividends and share repurchases serve important purposes we believe that our dividend should be competitive reliable and sustainable we view share repurchase as a capital structure balancing lever that we can use to right size our balance sheet to support our credit rating goals in addition we believe that share repurchase is the most effective way to return any excess cash to shareholders after we have met our other priorities of fully investing in our business and maintaining a competitive dividend because it allows shareholders to redeploy the cash to a more productive use while providing us with appropriate flexibility to respond to changes in our operating performance and investment opportunities for example we suspended all share repurchase activity for a period from the middle of through early in response to changes in our operating performance but we continued to invest in our business and grew our annual dividend during that period target corporation proxy statement back to contents capital allocation oversight the board of directors and its committees

board of directors met six times during fiscal all directors attended at least of the aggregate total of meetings of the board and board committees on which the director served during the last fiscal year all of our then serving directors attended our annual meeting of shareholders the board has a policy requiring all directors to attend all annual meetings of shareholders absent extraordinary circumstances director independence the board of directors believes that a majority of its members should be independent directors the board annually reviews all relationships that directors have with target to affirmatively determine whether the directors are independent if a director has a material relationship with target that director is not independent the listing standards of the nyse also detail certain relationships that if present preclude a finding of independence the board affirmatively determined that all non employee directors are independent mr cornell is the only employee director and is not independent in making its independence determination the board specifically considered the following transactions during fiscal and concluded that none of them impaired any directors independence mr baker served as chairman ceo of ecolab inc from which we purchased supplies servicing repairs and merchandise ms minnick served as the partner in two lion capital funds one of which had one portfolio company from which we purchased wholesale merchandise mr salazar served as a partner in wilmerhale which provided legal services to us mr salazar does not personally provide any of the legal services to target in addition wilmerhale represented to us that a mr salazars compensation was not affected by the amount of legal services performed by wilmerhale for target b mr salazar did not receive any of the fees from the target relationship during each of the last three years and c mr salazar will not receive any of the fees from the target relationship in the future each of the transactions above involved amounts that represented an immaterial percentage of our and the other entitys revenues and were well below the amounts that would preclude a finding of independence under the nyse listing standards in addition none of the transactions are related party transactions because none of the directors have a direct or indirect material interest in the listed transactions the board also considered each directors length of service on the board in making its annual independence determination specifically the board determined that ms austin mr darden and ms minnick each of whom are up for re election and have served on the board for more than years continue to demonstrate the independence of judgment expected of independent directors policy on transactions with related persons the board of directors has adopted a written policy requiring that any transaction a involving target b in which one of our directors nominees for director executive officers or greater than five percent shareholders or their immediate family members have a direct or indirect material interest and c where the amount involved exceeds in any fiscal year be approved or ratified by a majority of independent directors of the full board or by a designated committee of the board the board has designated the audit finance committee as having responsibility for reviewing and approving all such transactions except those dealing with compensation of executive officers and directors or their immediate family members in which case it will be reviewed and approved by the human resources compensationcommittee in determining whether to approve or ratify any such transaction the independent directors or relevant committee must consider in addition to other factors deemed appropriate whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable to target than those involving unrelated parties no director may participate in any review approval or ratification of any transaction if he or she or his or her immediate family member has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction we ratified one related party transaction in accordance with this policy during fiscal the son of mr knauss a non employee director is employed by a company from which we purchase wholesale merchandise mr knausss son is a sales representative and represented the supplier in its relationship with target corporation during fiscal he ceased representing the supplier in its relationship with target in november our relationship with this supplier pre dated mr knausss sons employment with the supplier in fiscal we purchased approximately million of merchandise from the supplier which represented less than of our annual revenues targets decisions regarding purchases of merchandise from its suppliers are made by team members in the merchandising departments and no member of the board of directors has any input or involvement in such decisions as described above under director independence the board affirmatively determined that mr knauss is independent and the transaction involving mr knausss son did not affect mr knausss

late february we announced a multi year plan in which we would aggressively invest in our business in support of our goal to position target for long term relevance growth and sustainable value creation in an industry that is experiencing significant disruption fiscal was a year of acceleration of this plan after making the initial investments in fiscal we tripled the number of stores that were remodeled greatly expanded the number and scope of fulfillment options for our guests introduced new proprietary brands and continued to increase wages for our team members all with the purpose of delivering strong consistent and durable growth and to emerge as one of the industrys leading retailers into the future fiscal financial performance exceeded expectations with our strongest year over year traffic and comparable sales growth in well over a decade and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted eps that set an all time record for the company the fiscal financial highlights below as disclosed in our annual report on form k showcase that we have created a highly sustainable foundation for future growth consistent with our pay for performance philosophy this performance significantly influenced payouts under the financial component of our short term incentive plan stip which is based on absolute goal levels of performance the impact on long term incentive lti awards was less notable as these awards are based on our performance relative to our competitors over a three year time frame adjusted eps a non gaap metric excludes the impact

shareholders shareholders approved our say on pay proposal in support of our executive compensation program by consistent with the vote of and vote of we believe open dialogue with our shareholders and incorporation of their feedback into our executive compensation program has been instrumental in obtaining shareholder support for our compensation programs design and direction we regularly engage in outreach efforts with our shareholders relating to a variety of topics and involve one or more independent directors in these conversations as appropriate we use the information gathered through these outreach efforts to help inform our compensation decisions we look forward to continued dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business guiding principles we believe executive compensation should be directly linked to performance and the creation of long term value for our shareholders with that in mind the three guiding principles of our compensation program are to deliver on our pay for performance philosophy in support of our strategy provide a framework that encourages outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace a significant portion of our executive compensation is at risk and therefore may vary from targeted compensation based upon the level of achievement of specified performance objectives and stock price performance target corporation proxy statement back to contents pay for performance we have a long standing belief that our executive compensation should be directly linked to performance and the creation of long term value for our shareholders we do that by providing our neos a mix of base salary short term and long term incentives with compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our near term and long term strategic goals annual total direct compensation annual tdc is the summed at goal value of each pay component and is considered a useful measure by the human resources compensation committee because it reflects the intended total value of pay at the time the pay decision is made refer to page for more information on how annual tdc differs from the total in the summary compensation table for fiscal and fiscal on page consistent with our guiding principles of ceo annual tdc is at risk of other neos is at risk and of our annual lti grants feature relative performance based metrics actual payouts vary based on performance against goals approved by the human resources compensation committee at the beginning of the performance period the charts below demonstrate the pay for performance nature of our incentive plans with variable payouts over the past five years for our neos our stip is based on a combination of annual absolute financial goals and progress made toward key strategic priorities our fiscal goals were approved at the beginning of the year our financial performance exceeded our strategic plans resulting in payouts above goal for further discussion of our fiscal goals and performance refer to pages of our lti program features performance based metrics and is tied to relative performance versus our retail peers over a three year time period at times we have supplemented our annual lti with performance based awards to address unique circumstances including the strategic alignment awards march and price vested options april both awards were performance based and aligned the executive team around key strategic priorities these awards were fully explained in prior years proxy statements target corporation proxy statement back to contents performance highlights the following highlights show our historical performance on key metrics that provide the basis for the metrics we use in our executive compensation programs over each of the last three years the metrics used in our compensation program are described in more detail in the cda narratives for each compensation element as well as in the footnotes below adjusted sales a non gaap metric is one of the metrics used in our psu compensation element and covers a three year performance period adjusted sales is calculated by starting with sales as reported on page of our annual report sales for all three years and adjusting fiscal which was a week accounting year to reflect a week accounting year to ensure consistent comparison with the psus fiscal base year fiscal adjusted sales of million excluded million which was the amount of sales attributable to the extra accounting week from fiscal sales calculated under gaap we use sales calculated under gaap as one of the metrics used in our stip compensation element sales calculated under gaap for and were million million and million respectively operating income is as reported on page of our annual report and provides the basis for incentive operating income which is one of the metrics we use in our stip compensation element incentive operating income a non gaap metric represents operating income on a pre short term incentive compensation basis and is calculated by excluding short term incentive expense from our operating income eps is as reported on page of our annual report we use eps as reported above as one of the

value is also inherently tied to stock price performance pbrsus payouts range from to of goal depending on total shareholder return tsr performance relative to our retail peer group payout value is also inherently tied to stock price performance annual ceo compensation decisions in march the human resources compensation committee approved annual tdc amounts for the ceo in consideration of his performance in repositioning target for long term relevance and sustainable value creation these compensation decisions also considered market positioning relative to our retail and general industry peers and represents a increase in annual tdc base salary increase of stip maintain at goal payout percent of base salary of lti increase of timing of total compensation decisions for executive officers as disclosed in last years proxy statement during fiscal we adjusted the timing of total compensation decisions for executive officers which shifted the timing of our annual equity grants from january to march as january is the last month of our fiscal year this moved the executive officers annual grant to the following fiscal year as a result the executive officers compensation as reported in the summary compensation table for fiscal did not include an annual equity grant thereby generating lower values as compared to fiscal the chart below represents annual tdc for our ceo for the past two fiscal years and in light of the change in timing of our annual equity grants provides context to the amounts disclosed in the summary compensation table annual tdc for our ceo base salary at goal stip annual lti total annual tdc annual tdc differs from the total in the summary compensation table on page because it a includes stip opportunity at goal rather than actual payout b includes the annual pbrsus and psus grants based on the dollar value used by the human resources compensation committee in determining the number of shares granted rather than the aggregate grant date fair value of awards as computed in accordance with fasb asc topic and c excludes the items shown under the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings and all other compensation columns for fiscal annual tdc also differs from the total in the summary compensation table on page because annual lti a excludes the option awards that were not part of our annual lti program and b uses the fiscal pbrsu and psu awards granted in january as a representative annual grant because there were no annual lti awards granted in fiscal due to the grant timing shift described above in last years proxy statement we made a similar disclosure except that the fiscal annual tdc amount was because we instead used the march pbrsu and psu awards granted in fiscal as a representative annual grant target corporation proxy statement back to contents base salary we provide base salary as a means to deliver a stable amount of cash compensation to our executive officers in alignment with our pay for performance philosophy it represents the smallest portion of annual tdc short term incentives all neos are eligible to earn cash awards under our stip program which is designed to motivate and reward executives for performance on key annual measures the financial component of our stip program is based on two financial metrics incentive operating income and sales the ceo stip design is exclusively based on the financial component see the performance highlights tables and footnotes on page for a description of where sales are reported in and how incentive operating income is calculated from our financial statements for our non ceo neos of their stip is based on the financial component the remaining of their stip is based on a team scorecard designed to strongly

view our fiscal stip program in the context of the multi year investment plan we announced at the beginning of fiscal this plan which was the subject of many of our shareholder engagement discussions and consistently communicated to the investment community is intended to achieve long term relevance growth and sustainable value creation in an industry that is experiencing significant disruption specifically the plan involves making substantial investments which put pressure on near term profitability in our stores supply chain and fulfillment network new proprietary brands and importantly higher wages for our team members fiscal was a year of acceleration of this plan after making the initial investments in fiscal in that we tripled the number of stores that were remodeled greatly expanded the number and scope of fulfillment options for our guests introduced new proprietary brands and continued to increase wages for our team members when approving the design and specific goals for fiscal there was a deliberate emphasis placed on growing top line sales and market share given the industry disruption while maintaining a reasonable level of profitability in the face of greater

to isolate those payments and benefits for which the amount vesting or time of payment is altered by the described situations this section does not cover all amounts the neos will receive following termination specifically the neos are entitled to receive their vested balances under our pension and deferred compensation plans as disclosed in the preceding tables under all employment termination

involuntary termination if a neo was involuntarily terminated for cause he or she would not be eligible for any of the post termination benefits described in this section if a neo is involuntarily terminated without cause the potential post termination benefits generally consist of severance payments under our icp and accelerated vesting of of the at goal payout of pbrsu awards and forfeiture of the remaining our icp provides for continuation of annual cash compensation salary and average of three most recent bonuses and non equity incentive plan payments over a period ranging from to months paid in equal monthly installments each of the neos other than ms smith is eligible for months of income continuation under the icp payments under the icp are conditioned on the executive officer releasing any claims against us a non solicitation covenant and are subject to reduction if the executive officer becomes employed by specified competitors in addition a neo who receives severance payments under our icp also receives a allowance for outplacement services the accelerated vesting provisions of pbrsu awards are described in the notes under the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year end table death if a neo dies while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and life insurance proceeds equal to three times the sum of the prior years annual base salary plus the most recent bonus and non equity incentive plan payments up to a maximum of million in addition the neos beneficiary will have the right to receive a payout if any under psus after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period disability if a neo becomes totally and permanently disabled while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and monthly payments under the excess ltd plan if he or she also participated in the base ltd plan our excess ltd plan a self insured unfunded plan provides monthly disability income payments with respect to the portion of annualized salary and three year average bonus and non equity incentive plan

experience a change in control as defined in our compensation plans whenever any of the following events occur or more of our board of directors consists of persons who were not initially nominated or appointed by incumbent directors for which purpose any director who assumes office as a result of an actual or threatened contested election will not be considered as having been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors any person or group acquires or more of our common stock we merge with or into another company and our shareholders own less than of the combined company or our shareholders approve an agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve our company our plans do not provide for any gross ups for taxes due on any payments described in this section target corporation proxy statement back to contents without termination of employment the consequence of a change in control to the neos without termination of employment is generally as follows the deferred compensation balance in the edcp will be paid in a lump sum as soon as allowed under irc section a unless the board of directors determines not to accelerate payment of these amounts and a double trigger applies to pbrsus or psu awards meaning that no vesting will accelerate upon a change in control unless within two years after a change in control an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason occurs with involuntary or good reason termination of employment in addition to the payments upon a change in control explained under without termination of employment if a neos employment terminates involuntarily without cause or voluntarily with good reason a material reduction in compensation or responsibilities or a required relocation following a change in control within two years following a change in control the double trigger requirement will be met and the post termination benefits that may be received generally consistof severance payments under our icp accelerated vesting of price vested options for outstanding pbrsus and psus granted before march the greater of a the amount the recipient would have been entitled to had the termination occurred without a change in control which ranges from to of the at goal payout depending on the award type and the participants age and years of service or b a pro rata portion of the at goal payout based on the percentage of the three year vesting or performance period that has elapsed as of the date of the termination following the change in control the balance of the awards is forfeited for outstanding pbrsus and psus granted on or after march an amount equal to of the at goal payout we used the greater of calculation for pbrsus and psus granted before march to prevent a neo from receiving less due to a change in control than they would have received as a result of a similar termination absent a change in control in addition we use the at goal payout for calculating the pro rata portion rather than actual performance to eliminate arbitrary results that could occur with a shortened performance period and in case calculation of actual or comparable performance metrics would be unfeasible following the change in control pay ratio disclosure as disclosed in the summary compensation table on page the fiscal total annual compensation for our ceo was we estimate that the fiscal total annual compensation for the median of all target team members excluding our ceo was the median team member is employed part time the resulting ratio of our ceos total annual compensation to that of the median of all target team members excluding our ceo for fiscal is to the median team members fiscal total annual compensation was calculated in the same manner used to calculate the ceos compensation in the summary compensation table on page to determine the median team member we used w wages or their equivalent for the calendar year for team members employed as of february the last day of fiscal for all permanent team members who were employed for less than the full fiscal year we calculated a daily pay rate and then annualized their w wages team members hired after december do not have w s so we used annual base salary for exempt permanent team members hired after that date and for non exempt permanent team members hired after that date we multiplied their hourly compensation rate by the average hours worked by all u s non exempt team members to approximate their annual compensation these estimates and assumptions were used to annualize each permanent team members compensation without treating any part time team member as a full time equivalent we included all non u s team members in determining the median team member treated in the same manner described above except that for non u s team members not paid in u s dollars the foreign currency was converted into u s dollars using the applicable currency conversion rate as of february for temporary or seasonal team members we used their w wages without adjustments except that if they were hired after december they have no w s so we used their gross earnings from our payroll records this approach ensures that compensation of temporary or seasonal team members is not annualized since the ceos compensation for fiscal did not include an annual equity grant due to a shift in our annual grant timing in last years proxy statement we disclosed the ratio of our ceos annual tdc to the median team members fiscal total annual compensation calculated on that same basis

candidate resubmission threshold john chevedden nelson avenue no redondo beach ca who held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting the language below in the proposal and shareholders supporting statement is reproduced without alteration proposal proposal improve shareholder proxy access resolved stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated documents to include the following change a shareholder proxy access director candidate shall not need to obtain a specific percentage vote in order to qualify as a shareholder proxy access director candidate at any future shareholder meeting shareholders supporting statement this proposal is important because a shareholder proxy access candidate might not obtain the currently required vote and thus unfortunately be disqualified the following year under our current rule even if he or she is better qualified than certain existing directors shareholders may simply believe that at the time of the annual meeting that the company is not ready for a proxy access candidate and hence may not support the candidate because the timing is not right a year later a majority of shareholders might determine that circumstances have changed due to mismanagement or economic downturn and that the timing is then right hence shareholders should be able to vote for such a highly qualified candidate the following are just a few of the scores of companies that do not require a proxy access director candidate to obtain a specific percentage vote in order to be a candidate in the following year citigroup c ebay ebay fedex fdx goodyear gt home depot hd this proposal deserves added attention at target since target has inside related directors directors with more than years tenure which can erode director independence somewhat like having inside related directors we do not have the oversight of an independent chairman of the board while our ceo chairman received the highest negative votes of any director in please vote yes improve shareholder proxy access proposal target corporation proxy statement back to contents position of the board of directors the board believes that the candidate resubmission threshold contained in its proxy access bylaw continues to be appropriate and in the best interests of target and its shareholders we adopted our proxy access bylaw provision in november and were among the first companies to do so recognizing that it was an emerging governance trend that provided additional accountability to shareholders we were informed by shareholder outreach and emerging best practices by early adopters when we approved our proxy access bylaw our candidate resubmission threshold that is the subject of this shareholder proposal currently prohibits a proxy access nominee who does not receive at least of the votes cast in favor of his or her election from being named as a proxy access nominee again for the next two annual meetings the candidate resubmission threshold is designed to balance the rights granted to shareholders to nominate directors using proxy access with avoiding the distraction of multiple votes on a candidate who was not shown to be viable the threshold uses as the level deemed to be meaningful support that signifies a viable candidate importantly the candidate resubmission threshold does not prevent the nominating shareholder from nominating a different candidate the following year additionally the candidate that failed to meet the candidate resubmission threshold is not permanently barred from serving as a proxy access nominee as that person may be renominated after the next two annual meetings candidate resubmission thresholds remain a common proxy access bylaw feature among large companies like target for sp companies a substantial majority have candidate resubmission thresholds and the vast majority of those candidate resubmission thresholds feature the same and two year approach that we use we regularly engage with our shareholders regarding our governance practices based on those interactions we have found that our proxy access bylaw has been viewed favorably by the vast majority of shareholders we have engaged with since it was adopted the board is committed to being accountable to shareholders and continuing to seek shareholder feedback on its approach as part of its ongoing shareholder outreach efforts the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote
