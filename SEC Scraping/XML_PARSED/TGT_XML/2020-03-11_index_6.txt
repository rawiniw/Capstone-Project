factorsour business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks we face risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply but other categories may also apply competitive and reputational risksour continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members we believe that one of the reasons our guests team members and vendors choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve target s reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate targets position or perceived lack of position on social environmental public policy or other sensitive issues and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters could harm our reputation with certain groups or guests while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts governmental investigations or litigation in addition vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation for example cvs operates clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests perceptions of and experiences with cvs may affect our reputation negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business through lost sales loss of new store and development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options our in stock levels and the value of our promotions are among the factors that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses our owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brands if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected target corporation form k risk factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementsthe retail industry s continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real time product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools consumers may also use third party channels or devices such as voice assistants and smart home devices to initiate shopping searches and place orders which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures by vendors in managing their own channels content and technology systems to support these efforts could adversely affect our sales gross margins and expenses if we are unable to successfully provide a relevant and reliable experience for our guests across multiple channels our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected our business has evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels in store online mobile social media voice assistants and smart home devices among others our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology software and processes to be able to conveniently and cost effectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and from our vendors we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offerings providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times low cost or free shipping and desired payment methods even when we are successful in meeting expectations for fulfillment if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional in store channel with efficiencies cost savings or expense reductions our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales and profitability could suffer a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home dcor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies or personalize our offerings to our guests we may experience lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our profitability investments and infrastructure risksif our capital investments in remodeling existing stores building new stores and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment our store remodel program is larger than historic levels and is being implemented using a custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood when building new stores we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays cost increases disruptions or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations we are making and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and selective acquisitions to improve guest experiences across multiple channels and improve the speed accuracy and cost efficiency of our supply chain and inventory management systems the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property rights resulting from our investments the value received from those investments may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition target corporation form k risk factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementspursuing the wrong investment opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs or failing to effectively incorporate acquired businesses into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests we rely extensively on computer systems throughout our business we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses malicious attacks security breaches catastrophic events and implementation errors if our systems are damaged disrupted or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives as well as providing training and support for those initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence for example during the past year we experienced disruptions in our point of sale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transactions negatively impacted some guests experiences and generated negative publicity information security cybersecurity and data privacy risksif our efforts to provide information security cybersecurity and data privacy are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation and results of operations could suffer we regularly receive and store information about our guests team members vendors and other third parties we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security cybersecurity and data privacy unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors and vendors prior to all data security incidents we encountered were insignificant our data breach was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have had data security incidents since the data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations based on the prominence and notoriety of the data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendors or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether which could adversely affect our reputation sales and results of operations the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding and has enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data complying with new data protection requirements such as those imposed by the recently effective california data privacy laws may cause us to incur substantial costs require changes to our business practices limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks each of which could adversely affect our results of operations target corporation form k risk factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementssupply chain and third party riskschanges in our relationships with our vendors changes in tax or trade policy interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and guests as we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our entire supply chain operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments we could experience merchandise out of stocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the u s with china as our single largest source so any major changes in tax or trade policy such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products between the u s and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity which could adversely affect our reputation sales and our results of operations political or financial instability currency fluctuations the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses such as the recent coronavirus labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our costs and or adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the u s ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur worsen or occur in other countries through which we source products it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations a disruption in relationships with third party service providers could adversely affect our operations we rely on third parties to support our business including portions of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platforms and fulfillment operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers aspects of our food offerings and delivery services if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected for example if our guests unfavorably view cvss operations our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations could be adversely affected legal regulatory global and other external risksour earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the u s nearly all of our sales are in the u s making our results highly dependent on u s consumer confidence and the health of the u s economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth reducing overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program we share in the profits generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or changes in consumer preferences concerning our credit card program could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit sharing payments target corporation form k risk factorstable of contentsindex to financial statementsuncharacteristic or significant weather conditions natural disasters and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers facilities or key vendors in addition natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as the recent coronavirus outbreak in areas where we or our vendors have operations could cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and guests affect consumer purchasing power or reduce consumer demand which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales we rely on a large global and changing workforce of team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected with over team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations unemployment levels prevailing wage rates benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs our operations guest service levels support functions and competitiveness could suffer and our results of

affect our labor costs and how we operate our business we also have support offices in india and china and any extended disruption of our operations in those locations whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise could adversely affect our operations and financial results failure to address product safety and sourcing concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or target s or our guests expectations regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination and product defects could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities our sourcing vendors including any third parties selling through our digital channels must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have a social compliance audit process that perform audits on a regular basis but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity the risk of our standards not being met may increase negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and events that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation result in lost sales cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests target corporation form k risk factors unresolved staff commentstable of contentsindex to financial statementsour failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales our business is

obligation to recognize collective bargaining units minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements health care mandates the classification of exempt and non exempt employees and the classification of workers as either employees or independent contractors particularly as it applies to our shipt subsidiary a technology company that connects shipt members through its online marketplace with a network of independent contractors who select purchase and deliver groceries and household essentials ordered from target and other retailers the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors in particular is an area that is experiencing legal challenges and legislative changes if our shipt subsidiary is required to treat its independent contractor network as employees it could result in higher compensation and benefit costs changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting information security cybersecurity and data privacy product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti bribery laws we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales financial risksincreases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business results of operations liquidity and net income a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law and related regulations tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the u s may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer we are dependent on a stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our

out method lifo our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was million and million as of february and february respectively and is further described in note to the financial statements vendor income we receive various forms of consideration from our vendors vendor income principally earned as a result of volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate

liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was million and million as of february and february respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self insurance

million and million as of february and february respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note to the financial statements pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status date of hire age and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate compensation growth rates mortality and retirement age these assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent was determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market conditions a percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older longer service pension eligible team members pension benefits are further described in note to the financial statements legal and other contingencies we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows

we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskas of february our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a london interbank offered rate libor our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments as of february our floating rate short term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position as of february the annualized effect of a percentage point increase in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate short term investments would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes and to the financial statements in the united kingdom s financial conduct authority announced the intent to phase out libor by the end of as a result we may amend our contracts that use libor as a benchmark but do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our financial statements liquidity and access to capital markets we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position as of february the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities as more fully described in note to the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own

recorded a deferred tax charge of million during we filea u s federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions the u s internal revenue service irs has completed exams on the u s federal income tax returns for years and prior with few exceptions we are no longer subject to state and local or non u s income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before reconciliationofliabilityforunrecognizedtaxbenefits millions balance at beginning of period additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years settlements balance at end of period as a result of the agreement with the irs on certain tax positions related to our global sourcing operations we reclassified million of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits to taxes payable this settlement had an insignificant effect on income tax expense if we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded million of the million reserve would benefit the effective tax rate in addition the reversal of accrued penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense during the years ended february february and february we recorded an expense benefit from accrued penalties and interest of million million and million respectively as of february february and february total accrued interest and penalties were million million and million respectively it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to our other unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next twelve months however an estimate of the amount or range of the change cannot be made at this time x referencesno definition available details name us gaap incometaxdisclosureabstract namespace prefix us gaap data type xbrli

in part to recognize the risks inherent to their participation in this plan we also maintain a frozen unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan covering approximately participants our total liability under these plans was million and million as of february and february respectively we mitigate our risk of offering the nonqualified plans through investing in company owned life insurance

accounting policies abstract organization organizationwe are a general merchandise retailer selling products to our guests through our stores and digital channels we operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations which are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital channels nearly all of our revenues are generated in the united states u s the vast majority of our long lived assets are located within the u s consolidation consolidationthe consolidated financial statements include the balances of target and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions all material subsidiaries are wholly owned we consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that target is the primary beneficiary of those entities operations use of estimates use of estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results may differ significantly from those estimates fiscal year fiscal yearour fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest january unless otherwise stated references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years fiscal and ended february and february respectively and consisted of weeks fiscal ended february and consisted of weeks fiscal will end january and will consist of weeks accounting policies accounting policiesour accounting policies are disclosed in the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation revenues merchandise sales we record almost all retail store revenues at the point of sale digitally originated sales may include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the guest or upon guest pickup at the store total revenues do not include sales tax because we are a pass through conduit for collecting and remitting sales taxes generally guests may return national brand merchandise within days of purchase and owned and exclusive brands within one year of purchase sales are recognized net of expected returns which we estimate using historical return patterns and our expectation of future returns as of february february and february the liability for estimated returns was million million and million respectively we have not historically had material adjustments to our returns estimates we routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest under the vast majority of these arrangements which represent less than percent of consolidated sales we record revenue and related costs gross we concluded that we are the principal in these transactions for a number of reasons most notably because we control the overall economics of the transactions including setting the sales price and realizing the majority of cash flows from the sale control the relationship with the customer and are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide goods to the customer merchandise received under these arrangements is not included in inventory because the purchase and sale of this inventory are virtually simultaneous revenue from target gift card sales is recognized upon gift card redemption which is typically within one year of issuance our gift cards do not expire based on historical redemption rates a small and relatively stable percentage of gift cards will never be redeemed referred to as breakage estimated breakage revenue is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions guests receive a percent discount on nearly all purchases and receive free shipping at target com when they use their target debit card target credit card or target mastercard redcards the discount is included as a sales reduction and was million million and million in and respectively target circle program members earn percent rewards on nearly all non redcard purchases revenue related to reward redemptions and deferred revenue under this loyalty program were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for the year

administrative costs consideration received from vendors consideration received from vendorswe receive consideration for a variety of vendor sponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances and for our compliance programs referred to as vendor income additionally under our compliance programs vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements violations such as late or incomplete shipments substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on historical trending and data this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material advertising costs advertising costsadvertising costs which primarily consist of newspaper circulars digital advertisements and media broadcast are generally expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement fair value measurements fair value measurementsfair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets level observable market inputs other than quoted prices included in level and level unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data cash equivalents cash and cash equivalentscash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the time of purchase cash equivalents also include amounts due from third party financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions these receivables typically settle in five days or less inventory inventorythe vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method rim using the last in first out lifo method inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market inventory cost includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred to deliver product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices under rim inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the inventory retail value rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality the use of rim will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory property and equipment property and equipmentproperty and equipment including assets acquired under finance leases is depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter we amortize leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term over the shorter of the assets useful lives or a term that includes the original lease term plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are acquired depreciation expense for and was million million and million respectively including depreciation expense included in cost of sales for income tax purposes accelerated depreciation methods are generally used repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred facility pre opening costs including supplies and payroll are expensed as incurred goodwill and intangible assets we use both accelerated and straight line methods to amortize definite lived intangible assets over to years commitments commitments and contingenciescontingencieswe are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents when a loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and if material disclose the estimated range of loss we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities we do not believe that any of these identified claims or litigation will be material to our results of operations cash flows or financial condition commitmentspurchase obligations which include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketing related contracts software acquisition license commitments and service contracts were million and million as of february and february respectively derivative instruments derivative financial instrumentsour derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps used to mitigate interest rate risk as a result we have counterparty credit exposure to large global financial institutions which we monitor on an ongoing basis note provides the fair value and classification of these instruments leases leaseswe lease certain retail stores warehouses distribution centers office space land and equipment leases with an initial term of months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight line basis over the lease term we combine lease and nonlease components for new and reassessed leases most leases include one or more options to renew with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to years or more the exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property the depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants we rent or sublease certain real estate to third parties our lease and sublease portfolio consists mainly of operating leases with cvs pharmacy inc cvs for space within our stores income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled tax rate changes affecting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized at the enactment date share based compensation the fair value for restricted stock units is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant incorporating an analysis of the total shareholder return performance measure where applicable the expense recognized each period is partially dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued as of pension plans the weighted average assumptions used to measure net periodic benefit expense each year are the rates as of the beginning of the year i e the prior measurement date our most recent compound annual rate of return on qualified plan assets was percent percent percent and percent for the year year year and year time periods
