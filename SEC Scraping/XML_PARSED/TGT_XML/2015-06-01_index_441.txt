means columbite tantalite coltan cassiterite gold wolframite and the derivatives tantalum tin and tungsten a applicability of the conflict minerals ruleto target target is a retailer selling both everyday essentials and fashionable differentiated merchandise at discounted prices target does not manufacture any of the products it sells a significant portion of targets sales is from national brand merchandise approximately one third of targets fiscal sales related to owned and exclusive brand products target may be subject to the requirements of the conflict minerals rulebecause of the degree of influence that it may exercise over the materials parts ingredients or components of some of its owned and exclusive brand products that contain necessary tg for for purposes of its compliance with the conflict minerals rule target had potentially in scope products in the owned and exclusive brand merchandise categories in the table below the surveyed product categories as discussed herein for targets outreach included all of the vendors of products that were identified as possibly containing tg within the surveyed product categories the surveyed vendors regardless of whether the products of a particular vendor were believed to contain necessary tg and regardless of whether target may have contracted to manufacture those products owned and exclusive brand merchandise categories apparel and home textiles electronics lighting kitchenware and small appliances home improvement and automotive footwear and luggage accessories jewelry and watches furniture home dcor bath and seasonal merchandise lawn and garden health and beauty products toys sporting goods and pet supplies paper office stationery and scrapbooking the merchandise categories listed above

five product categories target uses for purposes of its periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that cover all of the products it sells for target was unable to determine the origin of at least a portion of the necessary tg contained in the products of surveyed vendors in some instances target was able to determine that some surveyed vendors for did not source from the democratic republic of the congo the drc or an adjoining country targets findings about the source of necessary tg in products from surveyed vendors for were limited by the fact that some vendors did not respond to targets survey and that most vendors did not provide information about the source of necessary tg on an individual product basis target does not do any direct business with any smelters or refiners of tg so it has limited influence over them as a downstream company which means a company between the smelter or refiner and the consumer it must rely on its vendors to provide accurate reliable information about tg in its supply chain and on industry efforts to influence smelters and refiners target also believes that in most cases it is several or more vendor tiers removed from the smelters and refiners of tg used in its products in addition many of the vendors for targets owned and exclusive brand products are private companies which are not otherwise subject to or required to comply with the conflict minerals rule however through its leadership in the retail industry and through the efforts described in this conflict minerals report target is helping to address some of those difficulties presented to downstream companies and encourage responsible sourcing in its supply chain b targets conflict minerals policy participation in industry initiatives target supports the

confirmed by the service provider to be a smelter or refiner the service provider examined whether the smelter or refiner was listed as compliant by the cfsi the lbma or the rjc as of april of the smelters and refiners that were identified as sourcing at least in part from the drc or an adjoining country were listed as compliant by the cfsi and one was listed as actively moving through the cfsi certification process if the identified smelter or refiner was not certified by one of the foregoing independent third parties the service provider attempted to contact the smelter or refiner and or consulted publicly available information to attempt to determine the mine or location of origin of the necessary tg processed by the smelter or refiner summaries of surveyed vendor responses were

adjoining country target made training on its conflict minerals policy and compliance expectations available to all vendors including new vendors f product information identified smelters and refiners due to the challenges of tracing in a multi tier supply chain target was able to determine the origin of only a portion of the tg contained in its potentially in scope products for for the list of surveyed product categories that target determined might include some in scope products that are covered by the conflict minerals ruleas well as a description of the challenges of tracing in a multi tier supply chain see sectiona applicability of the conflict minerals ruleto target target received responses from of the surveyed vendors in connection with targets reasonable country of origin inquiry or due diligence as applicable unique smelters and refiners were identified by the surveyed vendors as potentially being part of the surveyed vendors supply chains of those unique smelters and refiners were indicated as not sourcing tg from the drc and its adjoining countries were indicated as sourcing tg from the drc and its adjoining countries but certified as compliant by an independent third party and was indicated as sourcing from the drc and its adjoining countries but described as actively moving through the cfsi certification process most of the described smelter and refiner information was furnished to target by the surveyed vendors based on all of their products as a whole instead of being limited to the specific products supplied to target as a result target does not know whether all of the identified smelters and refiners were actually in its supply chain in addition even if those smelters and refiners were in targets supply chain not all of the tg processed by those smelters and refiners that may have been contained in targets products was necessary to the functionality or production of products that target contracted to manufacture only products that target manufactures or contracts to manufacture that contain tg that is necessary to the functionality or production of the products are subject to disclosure by target under the conflict minerals rule the certification status of the compliant smelters and refiners is as of april and is based solely on the status as made publicly available by the independent third party without targets independent verification target took the efforts described earlier in this conflict minerals report to determine the mine of location of origin of the necessary tg in the products of surveyed vendors g future risk mitigation efforts target expects to take the following steps in to mitigate the risk that targets necessary in scope tg benefit armed groups continue to promote industry based efforts to educate vendors on the conflict minerals ruleand related compliance measures continue to refine scoping process to enhance accuracy and efficiency to enable more effective allocation of resources to potentially higher risk vendors request vendors to complete a conflict minerals reporting template for new products at the time that the products are first ordered based on the results of inquiries and due diligence for adopt and implement additional risk management procedures that among other things address vendor non responsiveness and non compliance include provisions relating to tg sourcing into the standard terms and conditions pertaining to vendor contracts and purchase orders encourage vendors to provide product level information for through ongoing outreach to vendors engage with vendors that provided incomplete responses or that did not provide responses for to help ensure that they provide requested information for and monitor and encourage the continuing development and progress of traceability measures for vendors that indicated for that the source of tg was unknown or could not be determined all of the foregoing steps are in addition to the steps taken in respect of which target intends to continue to take in respect of compliance to the extent applicable h forward looking statements this conflict minerals report contains forward looking statements which are based on targets current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include targets expected refinements to its tg compliance program all such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of as amended although target believes there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements targets actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause targets actual results to differ from its forward looking statements are a the continued implementation of satisfactory traceability and other compliance measures by targets direct and indirect vendors on a timely basis or at all b changes in the conflict minerals ruleand other political and regulatory developments relating to the sourcing of tg whether in the drc or its adjoining countries the united states or elsewhere and c those factors set forth in targets description of risk factors in item a
