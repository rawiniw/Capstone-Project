an estimate of costs related to its recently completed early debt retirement and updated expectations for second quarter adjusted and gaap earnings per share all earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share since the data breach last december we have been focused on providing clarity on the companys estimated financial exposure to breach related claims said john mulligan

the beneficial interest asset and land impairment losses more update on expenses related to the data breach during fourth quarter target experienced a data breach in which an intruder gained unauthorized access to its network and stole certain payment card and other guest information in second quarter the company expects to record gross breach related expenses of million partially offset by the recognition of a million insurance receivable expenses for the quarter include an increase to the accrual for estimated probable losses for what the company believes to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach related claims including claims by payment card networks given the varying stages of claims and related proceedings and the inherent uncertainty surrounding them the companys estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information historical precedents and an assessment of the validity of certain claims these estimates may change as new information becomes available and although the company does not believe it is probable it is reasonably possible that the company may incur a material loss in excess of the amount accrued the company is unable to estimate the amount of such reasonably possible excess loss exposure at this time the accrual does not reflect future breach related legal consulting or administrative fees which are expensed as incurred and not expected to be material in any individual period update on second quarter debt retirement costs in second quarter target completed tender offers in which the company paid billion to retire at market value million of its long term debt as a result the company incurred a pre tax loss of million or cents per share which will be recognized as net interest expense in

company now expects its second quarter adjusted earnings per share eps will be within a range around compared with prior guidance of to per share reflecting u s segment essentially flat comparable sales with lower than expected ebitda margin driven by promotional markdowns as guests continue to spend cautiously and focus on value in the current environment and canadian segment somewhat softer
