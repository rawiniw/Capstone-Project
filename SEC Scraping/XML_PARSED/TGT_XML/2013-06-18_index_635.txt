collaboration to discuss suggestions for future filings form k for the fiscal year ended february item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page analysis of results of operations page u s retail segment page sales page we note that sales growth in the past two years resulted from higher comparable store sales and the contribution from new stores with the most recent year benefitting from the additional week we also note that sales from your digital channels which include online and mobile sales grew faster than industry averages during the fourth quarter of as disclosed in the edited transcript of your earnings conference call on february please tell us the amounts of net sales from stores classified as comparable stores sales from stores excluded from comparable store sales and sales from digital channels for each year presented and sales from the additional week in in addition please tell us your consideration of disclosing the above information in your discussion and analysis of sales please refer to item of regulation s k and commission guidance regarding managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations release available on our website targets response to comment the following table includes the requested sales amounts sales in millions year ended stores included in comparable store sales digital channels total sales included in comparable store sales new stores rdaccounting week other total sales includes miscellaneous sales such as merchandise salvage and gift card breakage when preparing our filings we consider item of regulation s k and commission guidance regarding managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations release which require management to provide information that is material to assist in understanding the business including the results of operations and trends after receiving your letter we again reviewed our mda disclosures and continue to believe that the disclosures appropriately describe and analyze the most significant factors affecting sales our sales disclosures include comparable store sales growth an important retail industry metric our measure of comparable store sales includes sales from stores open more than thirteen months and all digital channels which combined were more than of total sales in each period presented our disclosures in each period also include a tabular analysis of the number of transactions and average transaction amount which is further subdivided into units per transaction and selling price per unit we believe these metrics are the primary measure of our sales performance and are the material measures to understanding our sales results we measure our results based on total sales growth from all channels including stores online and mobile because we believe that sales in one channel are not independent of other channels for example our guests are increasingly researching merchandise online but coming to stores to make purchases conversely guests often make digital purchases while in our stores or make digital purchases driven by a prior visit to a physical store as discussed in our fourth quarter earnings conference call on february following the fourth quarter launch of free wireless in all of our stores target com was the most commonly accessed site by guests while shopping in our stores we have not separately disclosed the digital sales amount or the precise growth rate because they are not material and channel distinction is becoming increasingly less relevant over the past few years we have made meaningful investments in our multichannel strategy including digital channels our recent earnings conference calls have provided information about directional growth in digital sales to demonstrate that our investment is beginning to show returns however digital sales represented an immaterial amount or less of total sales in each period presented and our reported comparable store sales increased by no more than a nominal amount as a result of digital sales growth as we have also discussed in our earnings calls the goal of our multichannel efforts is for all sales channels to interact seamlessly to meet guests needs and increase our overall sales regardless of channel conclusively differentiating the channel that drove certain sales can be challenging for example digital purchases made within a physical store and sales made in a physical store via our online gift registry could be classified as either in store or digital sales additionally physical stores accept returns regardless of origin of the sale while we expect digital related sales growth over time we do not believe that differentiating between channels will provide relevant information about our business as guest behavior and our multichannel strategies evolve such as fulfilling digital orders through our stores in we also disclosed the percentage point benefit from sales in the rdaccounting week which were not included in our comparable store sales measure for this amount is necessary to properly compare period to period total sales results other than those disclosures included in our filing we are not aware of any trend economic or industry wide factors opportunities challenges or risks that were known at the date of the filing of our most recent form k that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or operating performance we will continue to endeavor to provide meaningful disclosures that meet the objectives of mda and will make disclosures of material trends economic or industry wide factors opportunities challenges and risks of which we become aware in our future filings we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing that staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing and that we may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal
