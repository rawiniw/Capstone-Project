in january the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu amended accounting standards codification asc fair value measurements and disclosures to clarify certain existing fair value disclosures and require a number of additional disclosures since asu only affects fair value measurement disclosures adoption of asu did not affect the plans net assets available for benefits or its changes in net assets available for benefits in september the fasb issued asu reporting loans to participants by defined contribution pension plans asu requires participant loans to be classified as notes receivable from participants on the statements of net assets available for benefits previously loans were classified as investments asu was effective for the year ended december and was required to be applied retrospectively adoption of asu did not change the value of participant loans from the amount previously reported as of december target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund the stable value fund the fund consists of investments in collective trust funds and guaranteed investments contracts gics gics are investment contracts in which the plan owns the underlying assets and purchases wrap contracts from independent third parties that provide market value and cash flow risk protection to the plan investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts as it reflects the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan the statements of net assets available for benefits present the fair value of the gics as well as the difference between the gics fair value and contract value or the adjustment to contract value the gics are fully benefit responsive and are wrapped by two separate insurance companies which provide guarantees with respect to the return of funds to make distributions from this investment option the gic issuers are contractually obligated to repay the principal and a specified interest rate that is guaranteed to the plan there are no reserves against contract values for credit risk of the contract issuers or otherwise contributions to the fund are invested in a portfolio of collective trust funds as well as investments in the portfolio underlying the gics this portfolio includes short term investment funds high quality short term and intermediate term u s bonds including u s government treasuries corporate debt securities other high credit quality asset backed securities futures interest rate swaps and credit default swaps these investments are measured at fair value as described in note amounts due from broker for securities sold and due to broker for securities purchased presented on the plans statements of net assets available for benefits primarily relate to transactions involving the gics underlying portfolio these amounts are factored into the fair value of the underlying portfolio for purposes of calculating crediting rates and calculating the adjustment from fair value to contract value the fair value of the wrap contracts is the replacement cost of those contracts the gics contract value represents the sum of participants contributions plus earnings less participants withdrawals and administrative expenses target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund continued participant accounts in the fund are credited with interest at a fixed rate that is evaluated quarterly the primary variables affecting the future crediting rates include the current yield of the assets underlying the contract the duration of the assets underlying the contracts and the existing difference between the fair value and the contract value of the assets within the insurance contract the crediting rate of security backed contracts will track current market yields on a trailing basis the rate reset allows the contract value to converge with the fair value of the underlying portfolio over time assuming the portfolio continues to earn the current yield for a period of time equal to the current portfolio duration to the extent that the underlying portfolio has unrealized and or realized losses a positive adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value under contract value accounting as a result the future crediting rate may be lower over time than the current market rates similarly if the underlying portfolio generates unrealized and or realized gains a negative adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value and in the future the crediting rate may be higher than the current market rates the insurance contracts cannot credit an interest rate that is less than derivative financial instruments are used by the fund principally to reduce exposures to interest rate and market risks in the gic underlying portfolio the fund invests in over the counter interest rate swaps to mitigate risks of interest rate fluctuations over the counter futures and credit default swaps are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movements and to manage plan asset allocation target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund continued derivative activity of the fund is within the portfolio underlying the gics and has no direct impact to the statements of net assets available for benefits or to the statements of changes in net assets available for benefits the fair value of the derivatives is an input to the calculation of fair value of the fund on the statements of net assets available for benefits and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the derivative contracts

include premature termination of the contracts by the plan divestitures partial plan termination bankruptcy significant layoffs or early retirement incentives and mergers the plan administrator does not consider any of these events probable the wrap contract issuers cannot terminate the contracts at a value other than contract value except under specific circumstances including termination of the

nav is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus applicable costs and liabilities and then divided by the number of shares outstanding fair value of gics is based on the cumulative value of the underlying investments and the fair value of the wrap contracts provided by the insurance companies underlying investments in fixed income securities are primarily valued using prices obtained from independent pricing services these prices are based on matrix pricing models and quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics futures derivatives are initially valued at transaction price with subsequent valuations based on observable inputs to the valuation model e g underlying investments underlying interest rate and credit default swap derivatives are valued using models calibrated to initial trade price subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model e g interest rates and credit spreads model inputs are only changed when corroborated by market data a credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit spreads the fair value of the wrap contracts is based on the wrap contract fees provided by the

management fees paid by the plan are included as a reduction of the return earned on each fund income tax status the plan has received a determination letter from the irs dated september stating that the plan is qualified under section a of the code and therefore the related trust is exempt from taxation subsequent to the issuance of this determination letter the plan was amended and restated once qualified the plan is required to operate in conformity with the code to maintain its qualification the plan administrator believes that the plan is being operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the code and therefore believes the plan as amended and restated is qualified and the related trust is tax exempt the plan administrator has analyzed the tax positions taken by the plan and has concluded that as of december there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken the plan has recognized no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions the plan is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions however there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress the plan administrator believes the plan is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to risks and uncertainties the plan invests in securities that are exposed to various risks such as interest rate market and credit risks due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements the plans exposure to credit risk on guaranteed investment contracts is limited to the fair value of the contracts with each of the
