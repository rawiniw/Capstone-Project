sales period which we typically finance with cash flow provided by operations and short term borrowings additional details are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section in mda effective inventory management is key to our ongoing success and we use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management we achieve effective inventory management by staying in stock in core product offerings maintaining positive vendor relationships and carefully planning inventory levels for seasonal and apparel items to minimize markdowns competitionwe compete with traditional and internet retailers including off price general merchandise retailers apparel retailers wholesale clubs category specific retailers drug stores supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers and provide a compelling value proposition largely determine our competitive position within the retail industry intellectual propertyour brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including target supertarget and our bullseye design have been registered with the u s patent and trademark office we also seek to obtain and preserve intellectual property protection for our owned brands geographic informationvirtually all of our revenues from

our corporate governance guidelines business conduct guide corporate social responsibility report and the charters for the committees of our board of directors are also available free of charge in print upon request or at www target com investors item a risk factorsour business is subject to many risks set forth below are the material risks that we face for the convenience of the reader the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply but they may also apply to other categories competitive and reputational risksour continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of target s reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions while reputations may take decades to build any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business including consumer boycotts lost sales loss of new store and technology development opportunities or team member retention and recruiting difficulties for example we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of a data breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of more recently the sale of our pharmacy and clinic assets to cvs means that cvs will be operating clinics and pharmacies within our stores and our guests perceptions of and experiences with cvs whether within our stores at independent cvs locations or otherwise may impact our reputation if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty programs and marketing efforts our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores the functionality and reliability of our digital channels our in stock levels the effectiveness of our promotions the attractiveness of our third party offerings such as the clinics and pharmacies owned and operated by cvs and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies to drive traffic across all sales channels could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margins and expenses we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights in our owned and exclusive brands our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers in particular consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real time product availability using digital tools which can lead to decisions based solely on price the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise offering certain services our guests desire in our stores through third parties such as cvs offering a compelling guest loyalty program and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price match policy failures to effectively execute in these efforts actions by our competitors in response to these efforts or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and as a result have an adverse effect on sales gross margins and expenses if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable experience for our guests regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled our sales results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected our business has evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels in store online mobile and social media among others our guests are using computers tablets mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website target com offer applications for mobile phones and tablets and interact with our guests through social media retailing is rapidly evolving so that the majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors our evolving retailing efforts include implementing new technology software and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders directly from our vendors and from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers providing flexible fulfillment options is complex and may not meet guest expectations for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery times and low price or free shipping if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support these efforts implement improvements to our guestfacing technology in a timely manner allow real time and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests across all sales channels our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition if target com and our other guestfacing technology systems do not appeal to our guests reliably function as designed integrate across all sales channels or maintain the privacy of guest data or if we are unable consistently meet our guests expectations we may experience a loss of guest confidence and lost sales which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margins and profitability could suffer a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trendright decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories including apparel accessories home dcor electronics toys seasonal offerings food and other merchandise for example our apparel and home dcor assortment is continually evolving and in other areas of our product assortment including food we are supporting guest wellness goals and becoming more localized with items that appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes failure to obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences predict changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions emphasize the correct categories implement effective promotions and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales gross margins and profitability technology investments and infrastructure risksif our capital investments in technology supply chain new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns our competitive position financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments and the returns on these investments can be less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investments to support our efforts to provide a consistent guest experience across all sales channels implement improvements to our guestfacing technology and evolve our supply chain and our inventory management systems information processes and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace which depends on our ability to accurately forecast our needs and is influenced by the amount and pace of investments by our competitors in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores many of our expected new store sites are smaller and non standard footprints located in fully developed markets which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more time consuming expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets targeting the wrong opportunities failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory process guest transactions manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendors and other third parties service redcard accounts summarize and analyze results and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses and malicious attacks security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions engage in additional promotional activities to retain our guests and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our results of operations we continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence data security and privacy risksif our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests team members and vendors are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our sales and reputation could suffer an important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests team members and vendors we have programs in place to detect contain and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities or those of third parties with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members contractors vendors and temporary staff until the data breach in the fourth quarter of all incidents we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced in was significant and went undetected for several weeks both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents subsequent to the data breach however to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements based on the prominence and notoriety of the data breach even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny if we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs or stop shopping with us altogether supply chain and third party risksinterruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network increased commodity supply chain and fulfillment costs or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins expenses and results of operations we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner as we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise out of stocks delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our results of operations in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability currency fluctuations trade restrictions the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security weather conditions natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our results of operations there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the u s ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory and if these types of disputes recur or worsen it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain including vendor costs labor fuel tariffs currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives could have an adverse effect on gross margins expenses and results of operations changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions including portions of our technology development and systems our digital platforms and distribution network operations credit and debit card transaction processing extensions of credit for our redcard rewards loyalty program the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers and aspects of our food offerings if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations including with respect to data security then our reputation sales and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services in house if our guests do not react favorably to cvss operations or if our relationship with cvs is ineffective our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition if we wish to have clinics and pharmacies in any new stores those clinics and pharmacies must be owned and operated by cvs legal regulatory global and other external risksour earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states virtually all of our sales are in the united states making our results highly dependent on u s consumer confidence and the health of the u s economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances these conditions could result in us receiving lower profitsharing payments weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns which alone or together with natural disasters particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns particularly in apparel and seasonal items which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term results of operations in addition our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters are more prevalent natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores distribution centers or key vendors and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers stores and directly to guests which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales we rely on a large global and changing workforce of target team members contractors and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected with approximately team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business and regulatory compliance is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change many team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates collective bargaining efforts health care and other benefit costs changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members contractors and temporary staffing our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business we maintain a headquarters location in india where there has generally been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united states an extended disruption of our operations in india could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital sales channels and information technology development failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations if our merchandise offerings including food drug and childrens products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests our failure to comply with federal state local and international laws or changes in these laws could increase our costs reduce our margins and lower our sales our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate significant workforce related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible workforce related legislative changes include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements advance scheduling notice requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security product safety payment methods and related fees responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations including wage and hour laws the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti bribery laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs reducing our margins and lowering our sales financial riskschanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate including changes in tax law tax treaties interpretation of existing laws and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and results of operations could suffer we are dependent on a stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings if rating agencies lower our credit ratings it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations item b unresolved staff commentsnot applicable item propertiesu s stores at january storesretail sq ft in thousands storesretail sq ft in thousands alabama montana

to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on

unrecorded contractual obligations noted above we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements critical accounting estimatesour analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions however except as discussed below regarding canada exit related costs we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit finance committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sales we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the last in first out lifo method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change including changing consumer demand guest preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory was millionand millionat january and january respectively and is further described in note of the financial statements vendor income receivable cost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors vendor income vendor income is earned for a variety of programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions advertising allowances and compliance programs we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material excluding pharmacy related receivables which were insignificant at period end vendor income receivable was millionand millionat january and january respectively the vendor income receivable balance is described further in note of the financial statements long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value as appropriate we recorded impairments of million million and millionin and respectively which are described further in note as of january a percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not realized material losses upon sale of long lived assets investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments as appropriate we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities forward commitments unsubordinated related party payables lease liabilities and other potential claims potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts based on our estimates the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates see note of the financial statements for further information insurance self insurance we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted our workers compensation and general liability accrual was million and million at january and january respectively we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate however our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions for example a fivepercent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material refer to item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events including network security matters income taxes we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate liabilities for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties were million and million at january and january respectively and primarily relate to continuing operations we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note of the financial statements pension accounting we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rates the assumptions with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market conditions our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans assets was percent percent percent and percentfor the year year year and year periods respectively a one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million based on a change in our asset allocation policy in late our expected long term rate of return is percent for the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older longer service pension eligible team members pension benefits are further described in note of the financial statements legal and other contingencies we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents when a loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range historically adjustments to our estimates have not been material we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of canada exit related loss exposures we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations cash flows or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods refer to note of the financial statements for further information on the canada exit related contingencies respectively new accounting

statement item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskat january our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a libor plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations compared to our floating rate short term investments at january our floating rate short term investments exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate short term investments net of our debt obligations would decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investments over time but that may vary in different interest rate environments see further description of our debt and derivative instruments in notes and of the notes to financial statements we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates a percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully described in note and note of the financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant there have been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year item financial statements and supplementary datareport of management on the consolidated

programs vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements violations such as late or incomplete shipments these allowances are recorded when violations occur substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on provisions of the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we have completed our performance we perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level of the receivable in the aggregate the majority of year end receivables associated with these activities are collected within the following fiscal quarter we have not historically had significant write offs for these

canada subsidiaries comprising substantially all of our former canadian operations and our former canadian segment filed for protection under the ccaa with the court and were deconsolidated as a result we recorded a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other related charges collectively totaling billion the canada subsidiaries are in the process of liquidation subsequent to deconsolidation we use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the canada subsidiaries which has been reflected as zeroin our consolidated statement of financial position at january and january based on the estimated fair value of the canada subsidiaries net assets income loss on discontinued operationsour canadian exit represented a strategic shift in our business for this

totaled millionand million respectively and included the following pretax exit costs millions investment impairment contingent liabilities other exit costs total investments in canada subsidiariestarget continues to indirectly own of the common stock of the canada subsidiaries but has deconsolidated those entities because target no longer has a controlling interest at the date of deconsolidation we adjusted our investment in the canada subsidiaries to fair value with a corresponding charge to income because the estimated amount of the canada subsidiaries liabilities exceed the estimated fair value of the assets available for distribution to its creditors the fair value of targets equity investment approximates zero target corporation amounts receivable from canada subsidiariesprior to deconsolidation target corporation made loans to the canada subsidiaries for the purpose of funding its operations and had accounts receivable generated in the ordinary course of business the loans corresponding interest and the accounts receivable were considered intercompany transactions and eliminated in the consolidated target corporation financial statements as of the deconsolidation date the loans associated interest and accounts receivable are now considered related party transactions and have been recognized in target corporation s consolidated financial statements at millionand millionat january and january respectively recovery estimates and valuation techniqueswe assessed the recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims the net assets were valued based on the liquidation price received by the canada subsidiaries less the operating costs incurred to execute the liquidation process estimated creditor claims were valued based on our estimate of probable loss related to claims submitted to the canada subsidiaries based on our estimates creditor claims exceed net assets our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries further the final liquidation value and ultimate recovery by the creditors of the canada subsidiaries including target corporation is likely to be impacted by the manner in which the target corporation guarantees described below are resolved target corporation contingenciesthe recorded expenses include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted directly against us rather than against the canada subsidiaries primarily under our guarantees of certain leases of the canada subsidiaries the beneficiaries of those guarantees may seek damages or other related relief as a result of our exit from canada our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claims will be asserted against us and negotiated settlements will be reached and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claims to be litigated our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries in the liquidation process including estimated payments to the beneficiaries of the guarantees in the fourth quarter of we reached settlements with twoentities that controlled guaranteed leases representing approximately percent of the recorded accrual at that time under the settlement terms these entities have subrogated to us their claims against the canada subsidiaries the settlement amounts were materially consistent with our previously recorded accruals as part of a march settlement between the canada subsidiaries and all of their former landlords we have agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the estate in exchange for a full release from obligations under guarantees of certain leases this agreement remains subject to creditor and court approval the financial impact of this agreement is materially consistent with amounts recorded in our financial statements if the agreement is not approved by the creditors and the court it is reasonably possible that future changes to our estimates of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claims could be material to our results of operations in future periods we are not able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in excess of the year end accrual because there would be significant factual and legal issues to be resolved if the agreement is not approved any such losses would be reported in

vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices under rim inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the inventory retail value rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality the use of rim will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory certain other inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the cost method the valuation allowance for inventory valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end

occur substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on provisions of the

amounts due from third party financial institutions for credit and debit card transactions inventory the majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method rim using the last in first out lifo method inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores and import costs reduced by vendor income and cash discounts the majority of our distribution center operating costs including compensation and benefits are expensed in the period incurred inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices under rim inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the inventory retail value rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality the use of rim will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory certain other inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market using the cost method the valuation allowance for inventory valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal or we routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest activity under this program is included in sales and cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our consolidated statements of financial position because of the virtually simultaneous purchase and sale of this inventory property and equipment property and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or lease terms if shorter we amortize leasehold improvements purchased

or make significant software changes indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable for asset groups classified as held for sale the carrying value is compared to the fair value less cost to sell we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals valuations from third party brokers or other valuation techniques goodwill and intangible assets we use the straight line method to amortize leasehold acquisition costs primarily over to years and other definite lived intangibles over to years the weighted average life of leasehold acquisition costs and other intangible assets was years and years respectively at january commitments we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation leases assets held under capital leases are included in property and equipment operating lease rentals are expensed on a straight line basis over the life of the lease beginning on the date we take possession of the property at lease inception we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured the exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion the lease term is used to determine whether a lease is capital or operating and is used to calculate straight line rent expense additionally the depreciable life of leased assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term rent expense is included in sga expenses some of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes insurance maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises these expenses are classified in sga consistent with similar costs for owned locations rent income received from tenants who rent properties is recorded as a reduction to sga expense income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
