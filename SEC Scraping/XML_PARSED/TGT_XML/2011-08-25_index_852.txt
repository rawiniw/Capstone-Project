but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances for example when there is evidence of impairment the fair value measurements related to long lived assets in the following table

card receivables portfolio based on credit card holders ability to pay their balances if such deterioration were to occur it would lead to an increase in bad debt expense the corporation monitors both the credit quality and the delinquency status of the credit card receivables portfolio we consider accounts or more days past due as delinquent and we update delinquency status daily we also monitor risk in the portfolio by assigning internally generated scores to each account and by periodically obtaining a statistically representative sample of current fico scores a nationally recognized credit

tax rate for the three months ended july was percent down from percent for the three months ended july the effective tax rate for the six months ended july decreased to percent from percent for the

over the million per share of declared dividends during the second quarter of we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to target our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings the ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing as of july our credit ratings were as follows creditratings moodys standardandpoors fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper p a f securitized receivables a aa n a n a a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was x for the first six months of and x for the first six months of we have liquidity available to us through a committed billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in april which will expire in april no balances were outstanding at any time during the first two quarters of or under this facility most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at july no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives throughout we also continue to anticipate ample access to long term financing further in january we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio which may provide additional funding as of july the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was million of which million was funded by third parties and million was funded by target in january we entered into an agreement to purchase the leasehold interests in up to sites in canada currently operated by zellers in exchange for c million during the second quarter of we paid one half of the purchase price and selected sites in turn zellers has agreed to leaseback selected sites where the monthly lease payments on these leases and zellers subleases are equal at our option zellers is required to vacate the properties between january and march generally following a month notice period we have the right to select up to additional leases before our final payment in the third quarter of we have also entered into an agreement with a third party retailer to sell our right to acquire leasehold interests in up to of these sites we plan to invest between billion to billion in canada over the next three years to renovate acquired sites that we intend to convert into target stores establish supply chain capabilities build information technology infrastructure and acquire and develop other sites unrelated to the zellers transaction the amount we ultimately invest will be largely dependent on the number of target stores we elect to operate in canada during the six months ended july the value of ranged from c to c and averaged c on july was equivalent to c contractual obligations and commitments a summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of january was disclosed in our k as a result of our acquisition of leasehold interests in sites from zellers we have additional future minimum capital lease payments of billion during the three months ended july there were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations including internal development of new products programs and technology applications and acquisitions new accounting pronouncements in may the fasb issued accounting standards update fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in u s gaap and ifrs which amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position in june the fasb issued accounting standards update comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income which revises the current practice of including other comprehensive income within the equity section of the statement of financial position and requires disclosure of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in a separate statement this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have an impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position but the adoption will change the current presentation of other comprehensive income in our financial statements outlook we expect to achieve consolidated diluted earnings per share eps of to in the third quarter and to for the full year we expect that the majority of our second half eps growth will be driven by our u s retail segment ebitda and ebit resulting directly from the results of our integrated growth strategies of redcard rewards and our expanded food assortment this outlook section excludes any impact of a potential credit card asset sale which could be completed in late or in early in the u s retail segment the pace of comparable store sales growth remains the most important variable in determining our actual eps for we will likely produce results at or above the midpoint of our expected eps range if our comparable store sales growth in the third and fourth quarters meets or exceeds our second quarter comparable store sales growth of percent we will likely produce results below the midpoint of these eps ranges if our second half comparable store sales growth falls below our second quarter growth rate we expect that our integrated growth strategies will lead to moderate declines in our gross margin rates during third and fourth quarter which will be generally offset by a declining sga expense rate in our u s credit card segment we expect average receivables inclusive of seasonal impacts to remain stable in the range of billion for the remaining six months of the year we expect that the allowance for doubtful accounts will continue to decline in the second half of due to anticipated continued improvement in portfolio risks but at a slower pace than experienced early in the year we continue to expect our direct costs segment ebit interest expense on capital leases and related tax effects associated with entry into canada will result in a to unfavorable impact on eps we expect that the dilutive eps impact of the canadian expansion will increase to to due primarily to an increase in start up costs and a full year of lease related expenses we expect capital expenditures related to our u s retail operations to be in the range of billion to billion driven primarily by our store remodel program we also expect to open new stores in the u s in the third quarter of completing our new store program of total stores for the year we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan which has already reached the low end of our expected annual investment range of billion to billion the timing and amount of share repurchase activity will be dependent on market conditions the amount of

corporation involved direct participation in the management of one or more business units this section will not be used to discourage or penalize otherwise suitable employment opportunities in retailing or otherwise the corporation may require as a condition of avoiding dce designation for the executive a suitable written undertaking by the executive and the new employer that the executive remains obliged not to use or divulge trade secrets or proprietary information of the corporation and that the executive will not volunteer or be expected or required to violate that obligation in the course of the new employment c relevant considerations in determining dce the ceo will give suitable consideration to geographic product and price line marketing overlaps the nature and content of the executives particular knowledge of strategies and plans within the corporation and the extent to which the executives knowledge as distinguished from skills is likely to be a significant factor in generating an employment opportunity employment exclusively with a component of a larger business entity which component is not presently or known to be planned to be a direct and immediate competitor of the executives former business unit will not be treated as dce merely because one or more other components of that entity is or may become a competitor of the corporation or one or more of its business units officer icp payment reduction uniform and responsible administration of officer icp will require reliable information and verification to the corporation a reporting to be eligible for any officer icp payment during a period of dce an executive must in addition to all other required reporting provide to the corporation in writing an accurate statement of the amount and payment schedule of all cash compensation or its equivalent to be received from the new dce employer and of any subsequent change or correction of that amount in such form and with such verification as the

pending receipt of required information or verification which is later received and found satisfactory the corporation will pay interest at a realistic rate determined by the ceo for the period of delay the corporation and the executive will each fairly and promptly adjust by payment any discrepancy later discovered between reported and actual cash compensation of the executive but the corporation will have no liability for any amount not claimed by an executive in writing before final expiration of the executives payment period h reassignment and spin off reassignment and other

or otherwise would result in any portion of the payments hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under code section b the excise tax imposed on the executive under section of the code on excess parachute payments from whatever source would result in a lesser net aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the executive after subtraction of the excise tax than if payments and distributions to the executive were reduced to the maximum amount that could be made without incurring the excise tax under this sectionq the payments under this officer icp shall be reduced but not below zero so that the present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the reduced amount the reduced amount which may be zero shall be an amount expressed as the present value of the payments and distributions under this officer icp that can be made without causing such payments and distributions to be subject to the excise tax under section of the code to the extent necessary the reductions in the payments and distributions will be applied to those officer icp payments nearest the employment severance date until the full amount of the necessary reductions have been applied the determinations and reductions under this sectionq shall be made before any eliminations or reductions if any have been made under the corporations long term incentive plan if the auditor determines that this sectionq is applicable to an executive it shall so advise the corporation the corporation shall then promptly give the executive notice to that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such determination which shall include a statement of the reduced amount such notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the payments shall be eliminated or reduced as long as after such election the aggregate present value of the payments equals the reduced amount for purposes of this sectionq present value shall be determined in accordance with section g of the code all the foregoing determinations made by the auditor under this sectionq shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that parachute payments will be made to the executive if an elimination or reduction is not made as promptly as practicable following the election hereunder the corporation shall pay to or for the benefit of the executive such amounts as are then due to the executive under this officer icp and shall promptly pay to or for the benefit of the executive in the future such amounts as become due to the executive under this officer icp as a result of the uncertainty in the application of section g of the code at the time of the initial determination by the auditor hereunder it is possible that payments under this officer icp will have been made which should not have been made overpayment or that additional payments which will have not been made could have been made underpayment in each case consistent with the calculation of the reduced amount hereunder in the event that the auditor based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the internal revenue service against the corporation or the executive which the auditor believes has a high probability of success determines that an overpayment has been made any such overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the executive which the executive shall repay together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f of the code provided however that no amount shall be payable by the executive if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to the excise tax under section of the code in the event that the auditor based upon controlling precedent determines that an underpayment has occurred any such underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of the executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f a of the code in making its determination under this sectionq the value of any non cash benefit shall be determined by the auditor in accordance with the principles of section g d of the code all determinations made by the auditor under this sectionq shall be binding upon the corporation and the executive claims procedure for the target corporation officer income continuance policy statement
