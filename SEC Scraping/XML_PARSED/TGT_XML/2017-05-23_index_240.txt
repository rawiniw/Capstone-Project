discuss suggestions for future filings form k for the fiscal year ended january consolidated statements of operations page please tell us your basis for presenting gross margin on the face of the statement of operations in this regard we note you exclude depreciation and amortization from gross margin to avoid placing undue emphasis on cash flow depreciation and amortization should not be positioned in the income statement in a manner which results in reporting a figure for income before depreciation refer to asc s see also item a of regulation s k targets response to comment the presentation of gross margin on the face of the statement of operations is not intended to report a figure for cash flow or income before depreciation in response to the staff s comment we will

million generated by our global sourcing operations known as target sourcing services tss and million generated by our headquarters support team in india target india tss sources inspects and purchases inventory solely for target from vendors around the world primarily in china hong kong and korea as of january tss earnings were indefinitely invested to fund working capital needs for inventory purchases from non u s vendors continued expansion of the sourcing business and potential international ecommerce opportunities target india comprises various teams that provide technology finance marketing hr merchandising and other support to our business target india income earned after january did not meet the criteria to be considered indefinitely invested and a tax liability has been recorded for years after that date as of january tss and target india had cash balances totaling million and million respectively it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if the earnings from our foreign operations were repatriated however even if the entire million of earnings were to be repatriated and subject to incremental u s taxation any potential repatriation tax consequences would not materially affect our liquidity or capital resources in addition we have ample liquidity and capital resources without repatriating these amounts to

in our form q for the quarter ending july consistent with the disclosure in item geographic information of our form k for the year ended january virtually all of our revenues are generated in the united states the vast majority of our long lived assets are located within the united states because revenues attributable to countries outside of the u s are de minimis we have not established a formal accounting policy to allocate such amounts we will continue to monitor revenue and long lived assets attributable to countries outside of the u s if either of those amounts become material we will establish a policy for allocating revenues and will disclose revenues and long lived assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with asc and asc as appropriate on
