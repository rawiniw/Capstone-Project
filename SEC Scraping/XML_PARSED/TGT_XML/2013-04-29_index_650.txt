this year where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected directors are elected under a majority voting standard this means that each director must receive more votes for his or her election than votes against in order to be elected and if an incumbent director fails to receive a sufficient number of votes to be elected he or she must promptly offer to resign the nominating governance committee will make a recommendation on the offer and the board must accept or reject the offer within days and publicly disclose its decision and rationale board composition our governance guidelines set forth the board membership criteria that is followed in determining the composition of the board under these criteria directors are to have broad perspective experience knowledge and independence of judgment and the board as a whole should consist predominantly of persons with strong business backgrounds as part of the board s annual self evaluation process the board seeks input from each of its members with respect to the current composition of the board in light of our current and future business strategies as a means to identify any backgrounds or skill sets that may be helpful in maintaining or improving alignment between board composition and our business this input is then used by our nominating governance committee in its director search process table of contents the board does not have a specific policy regarding consideration of gender ethnic or other diversity criteria in identifying director candidates however the board has had a longstanding commitment to and practice of maintaining diverse representation on the board board renewal and nomination process the nominating governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members and making recommendations on director nominees to the full board the committee considers the following two factors in its efforts to identify potential director candidates the input from the board s self evaluation process to identify the backgrounds or skill sets that are desired and the future needs of the board in light of anticipated director retirements under our board tenure policies discussed below the board maintains a series of tenure policies contained in our corporate governance guidelines as a means of ensuring that the board is regularly renewed with fresh perspectives and that directors continue to have adequate time to devote to board service after any change in their careers under these policies non management directors may not serve on the board for more than years or years after they retire from active employment whichever occurs first in addition directors must resign at age and must submit an offer of resignation for consideration by the nominating governance committee and the full board upon any substantial change in principal employment these policies were applied as follows in fiscal stephenw sanger became subject to our five year post retirement term limit when he retired from general mills in and he retired in march jamesa johnson experienced a change in his principal employment in june and submitted an offer of resignation following a review and upon recommendation of the nominating governance committee the board declined his offer of resignation the nominating governance committee has retained an independent search firm to assist in identifying director candidates and will also consider recommendations from shareholders any shareholder who wishes the committee to consider a candidate should submit a written request and related information to our corporate secretary no later than december of the calendar year preceding the next annual meeting of shareholders in march upon the recommendation of the nominating governance committee the board elected two new directors mr douglasm baker jr and mr henrique decastro both candidates were identified as a result of the process discussed above more specifically mr baker was first identified as a potential candidate through a joint effort between the chair of our nominating governance committee and our executive officers including our ceo and was recommended by the committee in part due to his global marketing sales and operational experience as well as his ceo level perspective of organizational management and public company governance mr decastro was first identified as a potential candidate by the committee s independent search firm and was recommended by the nominating governance committee in part to enhance the digital acumen of the board in light of the increasing importance of new channels and technology to our business table of contents nominees for director after considering the recommendations of the nominating governance committee the board has set the number of directors at and nominated the persons described below to stand for election all nominees are incumbent directors the board believes that each of these nominees is qualified to serve as a director of target and the specific qualifications of each nominee that were considered by the board are set forth following each nominee s biographical description equally as important the board believes that the combination of backgrounds skills and experiences has produced a board that is well equipped to exercise oversight responsibilities for target s shareholders and other stakeholders specifically all nominees have strong business backgrounds with eight nominees having ceo experience in complex business organizations all nominees have senior management level experience with multinational enterprises an area of increased importance as we expand our retail operations outside of the united states seven nominees have expertise in consumer marketing or experience in a primarily consumer facing business an area critical to our continued success as a leading retail brand and the overall composition represents a balanced approach to director tenure allowing the board to benefit from the experience of longer serving directors combined with fresh perspectives from newer directors four nominees have served for more than ten years five nominees have served for five to ten years and three nominees have served for less than five years we have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling for good cause to serve if elected however if any nominee should become unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a substitute by the board or the board may reduce the number of directors table of contents director principal occupation other directorships and qualifications age director since roxanne s austin

director position to complement the chairman s role and to serve as the principal liaison between the non management directors and the chairman the board continues to believe that its current structure is appropriate for target at this time specifically the board believes that in light of target s clear strategy and the strength of its overall governance practices a combined chairman ceo

providing the ceo with a year end discretionary cash bonus and replaced it with performance linked long term incentive lti compensation to further align his compensation with shareholders included our canadian segment performance in our short term incentive sti compensation program so that management s incentives are fully aligned with achieving key performance milestones in this important business strategy and continued to use a relative performance model for our psus which requires above median performance in two key financial performance measures for a goal level payout and replaced supervalu with amazon com among our retail peer companies we will measure ourselves against for the next three year performance cycle table of contents compensation governance in addition we continued our sound corporate governance of pay practices including an independent compensation consultant semler brossy consulting group sbcg to assist the committee and the board with determining ceo compensation an annual compensation risk assessment as detailed on page stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors supplemented with an anti hedging policy a clawback policy to recover incentive compensation if it is based on inaccurate financial statements prohibiting repricing of stock options without shareholder approval and not providing tax gross ups to our executive officers the following sections discuss our compensation program and each element of compensation in more detail our performance framework for executive compensation pay for performance philosophy in broad terms our compensation programs for executive officers focus on clear and consistent pay for performance criteria and reflect the competitive environment in which we operate more specifically we establish short term incentive payout levels to provide an opportunity for compensation payments in the upper quartile of the marketplace when financial performance goals are exceeded and for significantly reduced compensation when our financial performance is below expectations incorporate a mix of variable cash and equity compensation elements with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance provide a competitive package heavily weighted in stock based compensation that is subject to increases and decreases in stock price value to align future realized compensation with returns to our shareholders and establish psu payout levels for performance measured against our retail peer group such that target is required to achieve a relative rank above the median of the retail peer group for a goal level payout table of contents pay mix allocation our compensation programs embrace a strong pay for performance approach in which variable compensation also referred to as pay at risk represents a majority of potential total compensation in order to motivate and reward sustained outstanding performance that is aligned with shareholder interests total direct compensation tdc for our executive officers is comprised of three compensation elements base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation we provide long term incentive compensation to our executive officers in the form of stock options psus and rsus tdc is allocated among the components in consideration of our strong pay for performance culture and in view of external practices and trends our competitive market assessment includes a comparison of the amount of each element provided to our executive officers to the compensation provided to their external counterparts among our retail and general industry peer groups we also examine the portion provided in each element as a percentage of tdc these reference points provide perspective on the external competitiveness of our programs to ensure we maintain our desired relative emphasis on variable compensation as a percentage of tdc as illustrated below fiscal pay mix provided to our neos is heavily concentrated in variable compensation elements table of contents pay mix components our compensation programs use a combination of performance measures with short annual and long term time horizons to provide a balanced assessment of performance and risk over time and to support our financial and strategic objectives element measure metric objective base salary scope of role experience reflects the scope and complexity of each executive officer s roles individual skills contributions and prior experience short term incentive earnings before interest and taxes incentive ebit reinforces our focus on profitability economic value added incentive eva evaluates the degree to which capital is efficiently invested through balancing profitability with capital investments personal performance excluding ceo recognizes additional critical factors based on subjective management criteria including the ability to develop a high performing team ability to lead strategic initiatives and demonstration of a strong commitment to high ethical standards long term incentive psus change in market share incents continued domestic net sales growth captured relative to our retail peer group over a three year period eps compound annual growth rate focuses on achieving sufficiently high growth in eps relative to our retail peer group over a three year period long term incentives rsus stock options and psus stock price ties executive compensation with our shareholders value assessment we believe that consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in stock price table of contents pay for performance link by our program design the actual tdc earned by our executive officers will vary significantly depending on the company s financial performance and for executives below the ceo individual performance that contributes to the company s results the following chart highlights the variability concept of our compensation program it shows our ceo s fiscal tdc at goal and the value of the tdc package one year later under two performance scenarios above goal performance reflecting ebit and eva results at above goal with stock price appreciation for the year and below goal performance reflecting ebit and eva results at below goal with stock price depreciation our other neos tdc packages exhibit a similar level of variability with this backdrop the remainder of this section discusses in greater detail our ceo and other neo compensation and each component of tdc executive officer compensation determinations when determining executive officer s tdc assuming at goal payout levels commonly referred to as target levels of performance we consider a multitude of factors to ensure that the packages are in line with our pay for performance philosophy while remaining competitive in the market for talent we consider individual factors such as performance experience and internal comparisons peer group market positioning is another important factor considered in determining each executive officer s tdc as discussed on pages due to imperfect comparability of executive officer positions between companies peer group market position serves as a reference point in the tdc determination process rather than a formula driven outcome the following considerations are also utilized when determining at goal tdc for our executive officers pay at risk emphasis pay at risk represents a higher percentage of tdc provided to our executive officers compared to that provided to executives among our retail and general industry peers particularly for our ceo and other neos and of tdc is in the form of pay at risk respectivelyaligning pay with our financial and or stock price performance our executive officers are accountable for and compensated based on our performance and the functions they manage table of contents relative large size we are among the largest of our retail and general industry peers with respect to certain key metrics see chart on page broad and complex job scope the job scope of our executive officers is expansive and complex our flat organizational structure results in greater executive officer involvement and insight leading to higher performance expectations we also have vertical integration whereby we manage our own international sourcing operations directly import a significant percentage of our inventory and develop and manage a large portfolio of owned brand offerings we have supply chain sophistication with the variety of categories we offer in our stores from perishable food products to apparel and linens to electronics and movies to pharmacies our multichannel initiatives and recent international expansion into canada present additional layers of responsibilities for our neos high level talent we seek to attract and retain the best available management talent to protect and advance the iconic target brand in particular in the last months we have performed external market searches for our chief financial officer and chief marketing officer roles and as a result acquired competitive data on tdc programs required to replace these neo positions these external searches reinforce our belief that our compensation programs are competitive base salary we provide base salary as a means to provide a fixed amount of cash compensation to our executive officers in alignment with our pay for performance philosophy it represents the smallest portion of tdc with respect to our neos disclosed in last year s proxy our ceo s base salary again remained flat and ms tesija received a fiscal base salary increase to reflect her performance in the prior year and her expanded responsibilities related to our multichannel initiatives short term incentives incentive opportunity under our short term incentive compensation program is based on a percentage of an executive officer s base salary objective

eva accounts for the other of the financial component of the short term incentive payout incentive eva is a measure of earnings after an estimated after tax cost of capital charge a positive incentive eva performance indicates we are generating returns on invested capital at rates higher than the cost of capital among other things our use of incentive eva helps us temper the objective of increasing revenues through new store construction with a counterbalancing measure of the profitability of our investments in new stores consistent with our calculation for incentive ebit our canadian segment results were included in fiscal incentive eva table of contents personal performance all executive officers excluding the ceo are eligible to earn a personal performance payment personal performance payments correspond to a predetermined percentage of base salary tied to a payout matrix for each personal performance review score the maximum personal performance payout is equal to of an executive officer s base salary review scores are a subjective element within our mix of variable compensation elements to recognize the critical factors upon which we believe leadership and performance should be judged but which are not quantifiable or linked to our consolidated financial statements all personal performance payments for executive officers are reported in the bonus column of the summary compensation table and any payments based on financial performance measures in our short term incentive program are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation column the following tables summarize the total short term incentive opportunity for financial performance measures at below goal goal and above goal and a representative incentive opportunity for the personal performance aspect

short term incentive payouts in relation to goal payouts from fiscal to fiscal for our ceo financial results for short term incentive program in fiscal we achieved incentive ebit and incentive eva performance of and above goal respectively the goal levels for fiscal incentive ebit and incentive eva were established at the beginning of the year and for the first time included the impact of the costs related to our canadian market entry in prior years the costs related to canada were excluded from our short term incentive program because canada was still in the start up phase in fiscal with start up costs and no sales including canada reduced our overall expected incentive ebit and incentive eva in addition goal and actual results exclude the gain on our credit card receivables held for sale to illustrate how our fiscal financial goals compare to historic actual performance the following charts compare the fiscal goal and actual performance with the three prior years on the same basis to allow for consistent comparisons between periods in addition to demonstrate the impact our canadian investment had on our goals the and charts separately show what the goal and actual level of performance would have been without the canadian investment appendixa provides a reconciliation of incentive ebit to consolidated ebit reported in our annual reports on form k for fiscal incentive

capital of for capital used to fund our core retail operations and approximately for capital used to fund our credit card operations table of contents long term incentives we believe consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in our stock price stock options psus and rsus are the variable equity instruments we use to incent our executive officers to maintain focus and to reward their efforts if successful over the long term in addition to the considerations listed under executive officer determinations on pages each year we evaluate lti mix and amounts in the market to establish annual lti grants for executive officers to align with shareholder interests the use of multiple equity based lti award vehicles supports our pay for performance philosophy stock options provide a strong incentive for stock price appreciation and shareholder value creation since an executive officer will not realize any value from such instruments without stock price appreciation to emphasize stock price growth which we view as our shareholders primary value assessment half of the annual lti grant is delivered in the form of stock options with the remainder of the grant split between psus and rsus our psu program focuses on measures directly aligned with profitable market share growth relative to our retail peer group over a three year time

incentive award to reflect her expanded scope of responsibility which now includes the entire distribution and supply chain network compensation peer groups the tdc levels and elements described in the preceding pages are evaluated annually for each executive officer relative to our retail and general industry peer group companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data obtained from publicly available proxy statements analyzed by semler brossy consulting group sbcg and proprietary survey data assembled by towers watson and hay group the selected retail peer group provides a cross section of general merchandise department store food and specialty retailers and includes companies that are large generally exceeding billion in revenues and meaningful competitors general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and

key talent including pension plan we maintain a pension plan that covers team members hired prior to january that meet certain eligibility criteria we also maintain supplemental pension plans for those team members who are subject to irs limits on the basic pension plan or whose pensions are adversely impacted by participating in our deferred compensation plan with the exception of one older supplemental plan that covers persons who have been officers since which includes our ceo mr steinhafel who is the final current employee in the plan our pension formula under these plans is the same

executives deferred compensation plan for our broad management group and above approximately eligible team members we offer a non qualified unfunded individual table of contents account deferred compensation plan the plan has investment options that mirror our k plan perquisites we provide certain perquisites to our executive officers principally to allow them to devote more time to our business and to promote their health and safety the compensation committee reviews these perquisites annually to ensure they are consistent with our philosophy and appropriate in magnitude the personal use of our aircraft is provided to our ceo for security reasons other perquisites are described on pages of this proxy statement greater detail on these components is provided in the tables that follow the summary compensation table on page ceo s all other compensation as reported in the summary compensation table on page the all other compensation for mr steinhafel is the largest component of this other compensation relates to supplemental pension credits given the magnitude of these credits a further explanation is provided below formula for all eligible team members these credits are determined by our pension plan formula based on cash compensation years of service age and interest rates which with the exception of an age acceleration feature are the same for all eligible team members listed in all other compensation a unique feature of our program is that executives have the annual change in the value of their pension benefits based on the formula either credited to or deducted from their deferred compensation accounts in essence this is an employer contribution to or deduction from their individual accounts for this reason we report the credits or deductions as all other compensation in the summary compensation table even though the value and change in value is pension related in nature reasons for increase mr steinhafel s pension benefit has been increasing over the last three years primarily because of higher average cash compensation due to more years in his role as ceo increasing age and years of service he has years of service with target the age acceleration feature and low interest rates age acceleration feature mr steinhafel is the only remaining participant eligible for an age acceleration feature of our pension plan that was eliminated for participants joining the plan after this feature treats him as five years older than his actual age starting at age but never older than age as a result his pension credits accelerate between the ages of and with his increasing age not providing any further benefit after age depending on compensation changes and interest rate movements the value of his supplemental pension and the transfers to or from his deferred compensation account can vary significantly for table of contents illustrative purposes the following chart shows mr steinhafel s current and projected spp transfer amounts through age fiscal year age spp credit transfer component of all other compensation assumes increase in salary and short term incentive payments at goal interest rates assumed to be flatan increase in rates will decrease the spp transfer value or increase the clawback value employment contracts none of our executive officers including our ceo has an employment contract income continuance we provide an income continuance policy icp to executive officers who are involuntarily terminated without cause to provide continued income to assist in their occupational transitions the maximum payment under this policy paid during regular pay cycles over two years is two times the sum of base salary and the average of the last three years of short term incentive and personal performance payments compensation governance roles of compensation committee management and consultants the compensation committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of our non ceo executive officer pay packages and for developing a recommendation for our ceo s pay package that is reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full board the compensation committee receives assistance from two sources an independent compensation consulting firm sbcg and our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president of human resources sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the compensation committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target the committee assessed sbcg s independence in light of the u s securities and exchange commission and nyse listing standards and determined that the consultant s work did not raise any conflict of interest or independence concerns compensation recommendations for executive officers are made to the compensation committee in two separate ways with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the compensation committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the compensation committee s consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies table of contents on its understanding of target s business and compensation programs and sbcg s independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with our ceo with respect to his compensation for other executive officers our executive vice president of human resources works with our ceo to develop our ceo s compensation recommendations to the compensation committee in developing these recommendations the executive vice president of human resources provides our ceo with market data on pay levels and compensation design practices provided by management s external compensation consultants towers watson and hay group covering our retail and general industry peer group companies management s outside consultant does not have any interaction with either the compensation committee or our ceo but does interact with the executive vice president of human resources and her staff in addition to providing market data management s external compensation consultant performs other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation the final recommendations to the compensation committee are determined by our ceo and include a recommendation with respect to the compensation of the executive vice president of human resources importantly sbcg provides the compensation committee with sbcg s independent view of our ceo s compensation recommendations all decisions regarding executive compensation and final recommendations to the independent members of the full board are made solely by the compensation committee say on pay at the annual meeting of shareholders held in june our executive compensation was approved by shareholders holding a majority of the shares voted on our annual say on pay proposal although we are pleased that our shareholders approved our say on pay proposal by a substantial majority we continue to engage in conversations with a number of our largest institutional shareholders to better understand their say on pay priorities and perspectives as mentioned before the board eliminated the ceo s discretionary cash bonus and replaced it with long term incentive compensation to deliver more of our ceo s total compensation as at risk pay the board will continue to carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions offered during other communications throughout the year when making future compensation decisions compensation policies and risk as part of our regular review of our compensation practices we conducted an analysis of whether our compensation policies and practices create material risks to the company the results of this analysis were reviewed by the compensation committee s independent consultant and discussed with the compensation committee which agreed with management s conclusion that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company more specifically this conclusion was based on the following considerations pay mix compensation mix of base salary short term and long term incentives provides compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our incentive structure with near term and long term strategic goals performance metrics a variety of performance metrics are used in both the short term and long term incentive plans this portfolio approach to performance metrics encourages focus on sustained overall company performance table of contents performance goals goals are approved by our independent directors and take into account our historical performance current strategic initiatives and the expected macroeconomic environment in addition short term and long term incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves and leverage that support our pay for performance philosophy equity incentives equity incentive programs and stock ownership guidelines are designed to align management and shareholder interests by providing vehicles for executive officers to accumulate and maintain an ownership position in the company risk mitigation policies we incorporate several risk mitigation policies into our officer compensation program including the compensation committee s ability to use negative discretion to determine appropriate payouts under formula based plans a clawback policy to recover incentive compensation that was based on inaccurate financial statements and stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors supplemented with an anti hedging policy recoupment policy our recoupment or clawback policy which covers all officers allows for recovery of the following compensation elements all amounts paid under the short term incentive plan including any discretionary payments that were paid with respect to any fiscal year that is restated and all awards under the long term incentive plan whether exercised vested unvested or deferred all demands for repayment are subject to compensation committee discretion for an officer to be subject to recovery or cancellation under this policy he or she must have engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the need for a restatement of the corporation s consolidated financial statements anti hedging policy executive officers and members of the board of directors may not directly or indirectly engage in capital transactions intended to hedge or offset the market value of target common stock owned by them policies on equity compensation general our use of equity compensation is intended to enhance the alignment of executive officer and shareholder interests and also to provide a means for our executive officers and directors to accumulate an ownership stake in target our executive officer and director stock ownership guidelines and their current ownership positions are discussed on pages of this proxy statement table of contents our compensation committee recognizes that the use of equity as a form of compensation can result in potential shareholder dilution our equity compensation awards have been granted under a shareholder approved plan long term incentive plan on an annual basis the compensation committee reviews and approves an aggregate pool of shares that are available for grant and in doing so reviews metrics relating to both the annual burn rate and the cumulative dilutive impact of outstanding awards the long term incentive plan expressly prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option without shareholder approval individual grants to executive officers must be approved by the compensation committee the compensation committee has delegated authority to make grants to team members below the executive officer level to our ceo and executive vice president of human resources grant timing we have the following practices regarding the timing of equity compensation grants which includes stock option exercise price determinations these practices have not been formalized in a written policy but they are strictly observed stock options and rsus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled january compensation committee meeting psus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled march compensation committee meeting in order to align the grant date of the award with our financial goal setting process these meetings are scheduled more than one year in advance we set the exercise price of stock awards at the volume weighted average trading price of our stock on the grant date we believe that the volume weighted average price is a better measure of the fair value of our shares than the closing price on the grant date as it eliminates the effect of any variations in stock price that may occur in the final minutes of trading if the closing price were used we have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around our grant dates our information releases are handled in a process completely separate from our equity grants on occasion we make equity compensation grants outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires promotions and recognition or retention purposes all such grants have an effective date on or after the date of approval if the grant date is after the date of approval it is on a date specified at the time of approval tax considerationscode section m our short term and long term compensation programs

pay retirement benefit under the pension plan expressed as a monthly single life annuity commencing at age is equal to the sum of a of the participant s final average monthly pay multiplied by the years of service not to exceed years of service plus b of the participant s final average monthly pay multiplied by the years of service in excess of years of service plus c of the participant s final average monthly pay in excess of of the average of the social security taxable wage base for the year period ending when the participant terminates employment multiplied by the years of service not to exceed years of service final average monthly pay is equal to one twelfth of the highest average annual salary bonus and non equity incentive plan compensation earned during any five years of the last ten year period the participant earned service in the pension plan subject to irc limits the present value of the accumulated benefit is based on the same assumptions and valuation dates used for the valuation of pension plan liabilities in our financial statements participants can elect other annuity forms that have an actuarially equivalent value we do not grant extra years of service to supplement retirement benefits early retirement payments may commence at age a participant who terminates employment before age has his or her vested benefit calculated based on the final average monthly pay as of their termination date but service is projected to age the vested benefit is then multiplied by the ratio of the participant s actual completed service to their projected service through age the result will always be equal to or less than the vested benefit as of the termination date benefits are also reduced for early commencement by per year between age and age and per year between age and age based upon the participant s age when benefits commence personal pension account benefit a participant s personal pension account benefit is determined by the value of the participant s personal pension account balance which is credited each calendar quarter with both pay credits and interest credits pay credits to a participant s personal pension account are based on a fixed percentage of the participant s eligible pay for the quarter ranging from to depending upon the participant s combined age and service eligible pay includes the participant s base salary bonus and non equity incentive plan compensation received during the calendar quarter subject to the annual irc limit interest credits to a participant s personal pension account are generally made on the

provide benefits under supplemental pension plans as described below because of limits imposed on tax qualified plans by the irc benefits under those plans are reflected in the nonqualified deferred compensation table the target corporation supplemental pension plani sppi restores the lost qualified pension plan benefit due to an officer s eligible pay being greater than the compensation limits imposed by the irc for qualified retirement plans and is based on the same benefit formula used for determining benefits under the pension plan the target corporation supplemental pension planii sppii restores the lost qualified pension plan benefit due to amounts being deferred under the edcp our current deferred compensation plan and therefore not considered for benefit purposes under the pension plan the target corporation supplemental pension planiii sppiii provides for a subsidized early retirement benefit once a participant attains age by increasing the participant s age by years but not greater than age for purposes of determining the reduction factors for early commencement of their pension benefits from the pension plan sppi and sppii as a result the benefit under sppiii increases when the participant is through years old and decreases in value after age until at age the benefit under sppiii is no new participants have been allowed in sppiii since and mr steinhafel is the only neo who participates in sppiii in the vested benefits accrued under sppi ii and iii were converted into an actuarial equivalent lump sum value that was transferred to the edcp this was done to allow participants more control over the investment of their supplemental pension benefits each year the annual change in the actuarial lump sum amount is calculated and added to or deducted from the participant s edcp account this same calculation and an edcp account adjustment also occurs upon termination of employment to determine the amount of the change in actuarial equivalent lump sum amount the prior transfers are adjusted by an assumed annual earnings rate based on a conservative investment of the prior transfers for the final average pay benefit actuarial equivalents are determined using the discount methodology we use in calculating lump sum payments under the pension plan currently we use the applicable interest rate and mortality factors under irc section e published in the month of transfer for active officers and in the month prior to the month of termination for terminated officers for the personal pension account benefit the actuarial lump sum amount is the balance

following events occur or more of our board of directors consists of persons who have not been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors for which purpose any director who assumes office as a result of an actual or threatened contested election will not be considered as having been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors any person or group acquires or more of our common stock we merge with or into another company and our shareholders own less than of the combined company or our shareholders approve an agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve our company importantly our

deferred compensation balance under the odcp together with the present value of the continued above market interest under the odcp as well as the deferred compensation balance in the edcp will be paid in a lump sum as soon as allowed under irc section a unless the board of directors determines not to accelerate payment of these amounts a pro rata portion of outstanding psu awards those still in their respective performance period will be deemed to have been earned at the target payout level and paid out within ten days following the change in control the pro rata payout is based on the percentage of the three year performance period that has elapsed as of the date of the change in control the balance of the awards is forfeited we use the target payout level for this calculation rather than actual performance to eliminate arbitrary results that could occur with a shortened performance period a pro rata portion of outstanding restricted stock awards and rsus will vest and be paid out within ten days following the change in control the pro rata vesting is based on the percentage of the three year vesting period that has elapsed as of the date of the change in control the

has determined to seek an annual non binding advisory vote from shareholders to approve the executive compensation as disclosed in the compensation discussion analysis cda tabular disclosures and related narrative of this proxy statement target s executive compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that encourages outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term our executive compensation programs reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we incorporate a mix of cash and equity compensation with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance put an emphasis on variable compensation with financial performance measures that correlate with the creation of shareholder value and directly align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by linking long term compensation to stock price performance shareholders are urged to read the cda which discusses in depth how our executive compensation programs are aligned with our performance and the creation of shareholder value the compensation committee and the board of directors believe that the policies and practices described in the cda effectively implement our pay for performance compensation philosophy table of contents the board of directors upon recommendation of the compensation committee recommends that shareholders vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the shareholders approve the compensation awarded to the named executive officers as described in the cda tabular disclosures and other narrative executive compensation disclosures in this proxy statement effect of item the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this item by shareholders will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding target s executive compensation practices the final decision on the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board believes that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interests of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of target s shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions item fourshareholder proposal to adopt a policy for anindependentchairman the american federation of state county and municipal employees afl cio afscme lstreet nw washington dc which held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved the shareholders of target corporation target request the board of directors to adopt a policy and amend the bylaws as necessary to reflect that policy to require the chair of the board of directors to be an independent member of the board this independence requirement shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation at the time this resolution is adopted compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair shareholder s supporting statement ceo gregg steinhafel also serves as chair of target s board of directors we believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporation s governance structure which can harm shareholder value as intel former chair andrew grove stated the separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation is a company a sandbox for the ceo or is the ceo an employee if he s an employee he needs a boss and that boss is the board the chairman runs the board how can the ceo be his own boss in our view shareholder value is enhanced by an independent board chair who can provide a balance of power between the ceo and the board and can support strong board leadership the primary duty of a board of directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of its shareholders we believe table of contents that having a ceo serve as chair creates a conflict of interest that can result in excessive management influence on the board and weaken the board s oversight of management an independent board chair has been found in studies to improve the financial performance of public companies a boozco study found that in all of the underperforming north american companies with long tenured ceos lacked an independent board chair the era of the inclusive leader booz allen hamilton summer a more recent study found that worldwide companies are now routinely separating the jobs of chair and ceo in less than percent of incoming ceos were also made chair compared with percent in ceo succession a decade of convergence and compression boozco summer we believe that independent board leadership would be particularly constructive at target where in gregg steinhafel s all other compensation of more than million topped the charts for overall perks last year among fortune ceos outrageously lavish ceo perks msn money december and steinhafel received more than three times the average compensation of the next highest paid named executive officer at the company studies show large executive pay inequity is associated with lower firm value greater ceo entrenchment and a higher cost of capital lucian bebchuk pay distribution in the top executive team february zhihong chen executive pay disparity and the cost of equity capital may we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders the board believes that any decision to maintain a combined chairman ceo role or to separate these roles should be based on the specific circumstances of a corporation the independence and capabilities of its directors and the leadership provided by its ceo the board does not believe that separating the roles of chairman and ceo should be mandated or that such a separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for shareholders the board believes that its current leadership structure and governance practices allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically we have a lead independent director with significant responsibilities that are described in detail on page of this proxy statement independent directors meet frequently in executive sessions that are presided over by our lead director with no members of management or chairman of the board present independent directors use these executive sessions to discuss matters of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate including evaluation of the ceo and senior management management succession planning matters to be included on board agendas board informational needs and board effectiveness the chairpersonsand all membersof the audit nominating governance and compensation committees are independent directors these board committee chairpersons determine matters to be discussed and materials to be evaluated in the areas covered by their respective committee charters our board believes that mr steinhafel s knowledge of the day to day operations of target perspective on the competitive environment understanding of shareholder interests and relationships with our guests business partners team members and the communities in which we do business allow him to table of contents provide effective leadership in his role as chairman and ceo furthermore our clearly defined lead independent director role and independent key committee chairpersons provide a framework for effective direction and oversight by the board our board believes that its current governance structure provides clear accountability allows target to present its strategy with a unified voice and serves the best interests of shareholders at this time the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman item fiveshareholder proposal on electronics recycling as you sow telegraph ave suite oakland ca on behalf of shareholder wallace global fund which held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that target corp s board of directors prepare a report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy options above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental impacts of its electronics recycling activities by providing mechanisms for take back of all electronics sold promoting reuse of working equipment and preventing export to non oecd countries of hazardous e waste and untested or non working equipment or components shareholder s supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth largest u s retailer of consumer electronics and such devices contain toxic materials such as lead mercury cadmium brominated flame retardants polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle less than of discarded electronics are collected for recycling according to the u s environmental protection agency e waste is the fastest growing and most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream comprising more than the estimated collection rate for e waste lags the u s recovery rate for municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental impacts analog tv sets and monitors with cathode ray tubes contain large amounts of lead flat screen monitors contain mercury switches and computer batteries contain cadmium which can be harmful to human health if released to the environment electronic goods collected for recycling in the u s are often shipped by recyclers to developing countries where they endanger health and the environment reports by basel action network have revealed appalling conditions in china and parts of africa where workers break apart and process old electronic equipment under primitive conditions workers openly burn toxic plastics and wires and melt soldered circuit boards to extract gold silver and copper these activities threaten worker health and pollute land and water target s corporate responsibility report states being a responsible steward of the environment is one of the most important issues that defines target s corporate reputation yet the company does not offer take back for the full range of electronics it sells and its vendors lack adequate certification policies to ensure safe disposal of materials collected the company takes back small devices such as music players and mobile phones but does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of table of contents electronics it collects or information about whether waste vendors are complying with the standards it has set recent instances of fraudulent recycling demonstrate the need for stronger evidence the company is monitoring how collected goods are processed proponents believe our company should develop a nationwide return program for all electronic devices it sells using stores or nearby locations convenient for customers all electronics collected should be recycled or refurbished by responsible electronics recyclers who are independently verified to meet a superior standard such as the e stewards standard best buy takes back a wide range of electronics for free and bars downstream service providers from exporting non working equipment or components to developing countries and requires third party provider audits staples and office depot also offer take back for large electronics position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes as it did with respect to a similar proposal last year that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders we address in detail our responsible recycling standards for e waste our in store recycling program where our recycling products go and other efforts to divert waste from landfills in our corporate responsibility report available at https corporate target com corporate responsibility our responsible recycling standards for e waste which we contractually obligate our vendor partners to follow address several of the concerns mentioned by the proponent those standards include ensuring that all items are refurbished broken down and recycled or marketed for re use processing all e waste items domestically and preventing e waste materials from being sent to landfills anywhere in the world monthly reporting by vendors on all sales and recycling activity which along with site audits encourages transparency and allows visibility into vendor processes our program includes consideration of whether vendors have met various certification standards such as the e stewards standard mentioned in the proposal and the responsible recycling r standard the vendors internal processes and reputation and periodic process reviews and inspections by appropriate target team members or third party inspectors the vendor responsible for the majority of target s e waste processing is independently certified to meet the r standard the proposal received this year is nearly identical to last year s proposal and asks us to consider expanding the scope of our guest facing recycling program to include all electronics sold our guest facing recycling program already allows guests to easily recycle small electronics such as mp players ink cartridges and cell phones as well as cans glass and plastic bottles and plastic bags in their local target store in the fall of we expect to expand the guest facing recycling program to pilot additional portable electronic items including items such as e readers cameras portable dvd players and cd players this pilot would not include larger electronics such as televisions or appliances we continue to believe that recycling these types of items through our stores would be disruptive to our store operations and less efficient relative to other alternatives available to guests for disposal of such items including the availability of local government run recycling facilities target is committed to ensuring we continue to offer recycling solutions to our guests where it makes sense for our business to continue to drive recycling efforts across the country target is now included on earth s website as a searchable destination for the recyclables mentioned above target is also working with third party vendors to include a vendor search function on target com that will provide destinations for guests to recycle materials that are not currently in the scope of our recycling program such as large televisions we expect to select the vendor by the end of the third quarter of fiscal and the vendor search functionality to be available on target com in early table of contents we do not believe a separate report is needed because we already actively monitor our recycling and disposal practices for e waste above and beyond legal compliance and our existing recycling program including our electronics take back is consistent with if not ahead of practices among general merchandise retailers based on the above the board believes that our current approach to e waste is appropriate and is in the best interests of target and our shareholders the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on electronics recycling additional information business ethics and conduct we are committed to
