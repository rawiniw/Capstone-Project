page please tell us what consideration you gave to discussing the reasonably likely impacts on your future results of operations of selling the u s consumer credit card portfolio and having td now underwrite fund and own target credit card and target visa consumer receivables for example such discussion might include how profit sharing income after the march sale of the credit card portfolio compared to credit card income for periods prior to the march and whether you reasonably expect a material favorable or unfavorable impact on earnings in future periods and why or why not please refer to item a of regulation s k targets response to comment on october we filed a current report on form k which included a press release announcing the sale of our entire u s consumer credit card portfolio to td bank group td on march we filed a second current report on form k which included a press release announcing the closing of the sale both releases described the terms of the agreement including that we earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios and provide all servicing for these portfolios our releases also summarized our expectation that the transaction combined with the benefit of debt reduction and share repurchase resulting from deployment of proceeds of the sale would result in mild earnings per share dilution in the year following the closing we specifically noted that our earnings per share would be an estimated cents lower in the twelve months following close compared to a scenario in which we continued to own the portfolio we also noted our expectation that the earnings per share impact of the transaction would be neutral over time based on our forecasted profit sharing income and expected benefits from share repurchase and interest savings concurrent with and referenced in those forms k we also posted supplemental schedules detailing the accounting aspects of the transaction to the investor portion of our website www target com investors see credit card transaction accounting implications dated october under financial news finally the mda in our form k for the year ended february disclosed the terms of the agreement accounting treatment considerations and our expectations for lower ebitda and ebit margin rates compared with prior periods with such impact becoming neutral and ultimately accretive to earnings per share over time in mda in ourform k for the year ended february form k we discussed the material impacts of the transaction on our financial results including the gain recorded on the sale of the receivables the balance sheet impact and related cash flows we also disclosed the amount of profit sharing income we received during fiscal from the arrangement with td in a note to our u s segment results credit card revenues earned in fiscal and appear on the face of our consolidated statements of operations we considered the requirements of item a of regulation s k to describe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations and to disclose known events that will cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues such as known future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or inventory adjustments we believe the disclosures in our forms k and the information previously provided to investors have appropriately disclosed our expectations for the future impact of the transaction as contemplated by item a of regulation s k analysis of operations page canadian segment page we note the significant dilution to gaap earnings per share attributed to the results of the canadian segment please tell us what consideration you gave to discussing and quantifying the extent to which the fiscal performance of the canadian segment is attributed on the one hand to start up costs and challenges versus on the other hand lower than anticipated sales and earnings of canadian stores once opened additionally please tell us what consideration you gave to disclosing the extent to which the performance of the canadian segment can reasonably be expected to continue to negatively impact your results of operations in future periods please refer to item a of regulation s k targets response to comment within mda we stated that our canadian results represented only a partial year of operations with stores open a little more than half of the year on average during the year we experienced significant supply chain issues that contributed to inadequate in stock levels and excess inventory in our distribution facilities these issues combined with softer than expected sales resulted in performance below our expectations because of the interrelated nature of these issues we were unable to separately identify and quantify the impacts from start up issues versus lower than expected sales and earnings for that reason we attributed our gross margin performance to a combination of these issues we considered the requirements of item a ii of regulation s k in order to comply with these requirements we included a footnote to our canadian segment rate analysis table in mda that states due to the start up nature of our canadian segment the rates above may not be indicative of future results in future filings and as our canadian operations mature we will continue to provide a description of material matters that affected our performance or we reasonably expect to affect the future performance of our segments and overall operations liquidity and capital resources page in future filings to the extent material please expand your discussion of how the trend towards mobile and multi channel shopping will affect both your liquidity and capital resources expenditures moving forward in this regard we note your risk factor disclosures on pages and that an increasing portion of your business is migrating online and that you plan on making significant technology investments to keep pace with this transition as well as your disclosure on page that you plan for billion to billion in capital expenditures in and your chief financial officers statements made during the fourth quarter earnings call on february that a large portion of these expenditures will be used towards supply chain technology to support multichannel efforts rather than investing in new store locations please refer to item a of regulation s k targets response to comment in future filings to the extent material we will expand our discussion if we expect the trend towards mobile and multi channel shopping to affect our liquidity and capital expenditures to provide the staff with additional context our planned u s capital expenditures range from billion to billion during the fourth quarter earnings call we noted that the mix of capital investment has shifted from a focus on building and remodeling stores to supporting our multichannel initiatives total capital expenditures however have remained largely consistent over the last five years with a range from billion to billion critical accounting estimates page income taxes page we note you have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million as of february primarily related to the start up operations of the canadian segment and you have concluded no valuation allowance is necessary please tell us what consideration you gave to disclosing additional information that would allow for an assessment of the probability of future material charges related to the recoverability of these net operating loss carryforwards for example tell us your consideration of disclosing the positive and negative evidence that was evaluated in concluding it is more likely than not these carryforwards will be fully utilized prior to expiration the evidence which indicates the losses in the first year of operations in the canadian segment are an aberration rather than a continuing condition and the risks and uncertainties which could reasonably be expected to impact your assessment of the need for a valuation allowance in future periods please refer to item a ii of regulation s k which requires a description of a known uncertainty as well as sectionv of sec release targets response to comment we expected losses in canada during because of the start up nature of our operations as noted in our response to comment the challenges we faced resulted in lower than expected sales and greater than expected losses during the year we considered the requirements of item a ii of regulation s k and sectionv of sec release critical accounting estimates which require describing why accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change as it relates to our assessment of the recoverability of foreign net operating losses we described in our form k critical accounting estimates section that our foreign net operating loss carryforwards primarily related to our start up operations in canada and expire between and we believed that this information along with our long history of profitable us operations and expectations of profitable canadian operations provided sufficient information for an assessment of the probability of future material charges related to the recoverability of these net operating loss carryforwards in future filings and as our canadian operations mature we will continue to provide a description of matters that affected our performance or we reasonably expect to affect the future performance of our canadian segment and the impact such matters may have on our expectations for realization of our net operating loss carryforwards item financial statements and supplementary data page notes to consolidated financial statements page note credit card receivables transaction page with reference to the guidance in asc that was applied please tell us the basis in gaap for your accounting for the march credit card receivables transaction in doing so please be sure to address the basis for immediate gain recognition the nature and terms of the beneficial interest retained and your consideration of whether servicing assets or liabilities should be recorded in connection with the transfer targets response to comment as disclosed we accounted for the march credit card receivables transaction as a sale in connection with the sale we entered into a purchase and sale agreement the purchase agreement and credit card program agreement the program agreement under which td underwrites funds and owns target credit card and target visa receivables in the u s td controls risk management policies and oversees regulatory compliance and we perform account servicing and primary marketing functions under the program agreement we earn a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios when evaluating the transaction it is important to note that we no longer originate any loans td is the legal issuer of the accounts and the related credit card receivables and has direct relationships with the cardholders this structure required us to evaluate only the preexisting loans as of the transaction date for sale treatment asc requires sale accounting if the following conditions are met the transferred financial assets have been isolated from the transferor even in the event of bankruptcy or other receivership the determination of legal isolation is largely a matter of law for this reason and as described in the purchase agreement we retained independent third party legal counsel to give us true sale at law and nonconsolidation opinions on whether the sold loans had been legally isolated from target and its subsidiaries based upon those opinions and our evaluation of the transaction we concluded that the transferred financial assets had been isolated from target even in the event of bankruptcy or other receivership and the asc criterion had been met each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received and no constraint on the transferee provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor the program agreement allows td to sell exchange securitize pledge or participate the loans we also evaluated the program agreement terms and concluded that there were no constraints on tds right to pledge or exchange the assets the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets the program agreement outlines our rights in the event of a termination we do not believe these rights individually or taken together give us effective control because they do not entitle or obligate us to repurchase the existing receivables before maturity or provide us with the unilateral ability to cause td to return the receivables to us all conditions under which we have purchase options are conditioned by events outside of our control or are permitted clean up calls as defined in asc in addition the terms do not permit td to require us to repurchase the existing receivables at a price so favorable to them that this would be a probable event as such we believe this condition was met because the transaction qualified as a sale asc b required that we derecognize the credit card receivables record a beneficial interest asset and recognize a gain under the program agreement terms we are entitled to a substantial portion of the profits generated by the target credit card and target visa portfolios the beneficial interest asset represents the present value of our right to receive these cash flows from the sold receivables in determining the proceeds from the sale as defined in asc we considered whether we should record a servicing asset or liability as required by asc based upon the terms of the program agreement our servicing fee approximates that of a market participant and thus represents adequate compensation as part of our assessment we benchmarked the servicing fee against market rates and determined we were receiving market rates for these reasons we did not record a servicing asset or liability note inventory page we note your disclosure that the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices please explain to us whether the lifo provision represents an additional expense because the cost of inventories determined using the fifo method exceed the cost of inventories determined using the lifo method or a reduction to expense because the cost of inventories determined using the lifo method exceed the cost of inventories determined using the fifo method in addition please revise your disclosure in future filings to clarify what the lifo provision represents and to disclose the amount of the lifo provision if material targets response to comment if the lifo inventory method is used paragraph c of rule of regulation s x requires that registrants disclose parenthetically or in a note to the consolidated financial statements the excess of replacement or current cost over stated lifo value if the difference is material because our inventories turn several times annually fifo cost approximates replacement cost the current replacement cost fifo cost of our inventories did not materially differ from stated lifo value for any year presented for this reason we did not disclose the difference on february the approximate replacement cost of our inventories was million and the stated lifo value was million resulting in a credit lifo reserve of million on february the approximate replacement cost of our inventories was million and the stated lifo value was million resulting in a credit lifo reserve of million in future filings if material we will disclose the amount of the lifo provision and clarify what the provision represents note commitments and contingencies page please tell us how you concluded that recovery of the million receivable from your insurance carriers is probable targets response to comment our fourth quarter receivable is related to our network security insurance policies in reaching our conclusion that recovery from our insurance carriers is probable we relied on the analysis of counsel our review of the applicable insurance policies and our conversations and written correspondence with the insurance carriers all of this analysis supported the conclusion that it is probable we will recover the million of covered expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of subsequent to filing our form k we received an initial payment of million on our claim from our primary layer of network security insurance and expect to receive additional payments as of the end of we had notified our crime and commercial general liability insurance carriers of the event but had not received acknowledgment of coverage from those insurers and as a result no receivables were recorded related to these policies we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing that staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing and that we may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the united states on behalf of target corporation i thank you for your consideration of our response
