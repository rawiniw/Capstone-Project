traditional and off price general merchandise retailers apparel retailers internet retailers wholesale clubs category specific retailers drug stores supermarkets and other table of contents forms of retail commerce our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry in our credit card segment our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at target our financial products compete with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume our ability to differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs terms credit line management and guest service determines our competitive position among credit card issuers intellectual property our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including target supertarget and our bullseye design have been registered with the u s patent and trademark office we also seek to obtain intellectual property protection for our private label brands geographic information substantially all of our revenues are

factors our business is subject to a variety of risks the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic operational compliance and financial risks set forth below are the most significant risks that we face if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers our results of operations could be adversely affected the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service and marketing efforts guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores our in stock levels and other factors also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales gross margin and expenses if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences our sales gross margin and profitability could suffer a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions in apparel home dcor seasonal offerings food and other merchandise failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of the target brand we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary table of contents constituencies guests team members the communities in which we operate and shareholders to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse affects on our business including consumer boycotts loss of new store development opportunities or team member recruiting difficulties we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states all of our stores are located within the united states making our results highly dependent on u s consumer confidence and the health of the u s economy in addition a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales and reducing gross margins in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales these same considerations impact the success of our credit card segment as any deterioration can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances and we may not be able to anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit resulting in higher bad debt expense the recent credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of has significantly restricted our ability to make changes to cardholder terms that are commensurate with changes in the risk profile of our credit card receivables portfolio demand for consumer credit is also impacted by macroeconomic conditions and other factors and our performance can also be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use debit cards or other forms of payment if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce our results of operations could be adversely affected with over team members our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain a growing number of qualified team members many of those team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members our operations guest service levels and support functions could suffer those factors together with increasing wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth and difficulty in executing plans for new stores expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores in addition for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer s ability to acquire land obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project of which our store may be one component turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing expanding and remodeling our stores a significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur within fully developed markets which is generally a more time consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets table of contents interruptions with our vendors and within our supply chain could adversely affect our results we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons we could experience merchandise out of stocks that could lead to lost sales in addition a large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united states with china as our single largest source political or financial instability trade restrictions increased tariffs currency exchange rates the outbreak of pandemics labor unrest transport capacity and costs port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our results of operations failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations if our merchandise offerings including food drug and children s products do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety we could experience lost sales experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns including food or drug contamination could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests if we experience a data security breach we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation in addition our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products decline to use our pharmacy services or stop shopping at our stores altogether such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations our failure to comply with federal state or local laws or changes in these laws could increase our expenses our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce which is not represented by unions as of the end of could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirements and health care mandates in addition changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit medicare reimbursements privacy and information security product safety or environmental protection among others could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices in addition if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations particularly wage and hour laws we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our results of operations given the geographic concentration of our stores natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations our three largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores which could adversely affect our results of operations table of contents changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors changes in the tax laws the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate in addition our effective income tax rate generally bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due to the tax free nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit our growth plans liquidity and results of operations could suffer we are dependent on a stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans in particular we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital and the asset backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio in addition we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our results of operations we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could adversely affect our results of operations item b unresolved staff comments not applicable table of contents item

sales varies across the retail industry as a result our comparable store sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies comparable store sales are sales from our online business and sales from general merchandise and supertarget stores open longer than one year including sales from stores that have been remodeled or expanded while remaining open sales from stores that have been relocated to new buildings of the same format within the same trade area in which the new store opens at about the same time as the old store closes comparable store sales do not include sales from general merchandise stores that have been converted or relocated within the same trade area to a supertarget store format sales from stores that were intentionally closed to be remodeled expanded or reconstructed comparable store sales comparable store sales drivers of changes in comparable store sales number of transactions average transaction amount units per transaction selling price per unit the comparable store sales increases or decreases above are calculated by comparing sales in fiscal year periods with comparable prior fiscal year periods of equivalent length in fiscal the change in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in the average transaction amount primarily due to a decrease in the number of units per transaction

reduction in the gross margin rate sales in merchandise categories that yield lower gross margin rates outpaced sales in our higher margin apparel and home merchandise categories this mix impact was

balance weighted one month libor b as a percentage of average gross credit card receivables c spread to libor is a metric used to analyze the performance of our total credit card portfolio because the majority of our portfolio earned finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate and the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor our primary measure of segment profit in our credit card segment is the ebit generated by our total credit card receivables portfolio less the interest expense on nonrecourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level this metric approximates overall financial performance of the entire credit card portfolio we manage by measuring the difference between ebit earned on the portfolio and a hypothetical benchmark rate financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor for the first quarter of the vast majority of our portfolio accrued finance charge revenue at rates tied to the prime rate effective april we implemented a terms change to our portfolio that established a minimum annual percentage rate apr applied to cardholder account balances under these terms finance charges accrue at a fixed apr if the benchmark prime rate is less than if the prime rate is greater than finance charges accrue at the benchmark prime rate plus a spread because the prime rate was less than during the majority of our portfolio accrued finance charges at a fixed apr subsequent to this terms change as a result of regulatory actions that impact our portfolio effective january we implemented a second terms change that converted the minimum apr for the majority of our accounts to a variable rate and we eliminated penalty table of contents pricing for all current or nondelinquent accounts penalty pricing is the charging of a higher interest rate for a period of time generally months and is triggered when a cardholder repeatedly fails to make timely payments in credit card segment profit increased to million from million as a result of improved portfolio performance spread to libor and significantly lower funding costs the reduction in our investment in the portfolio combined with these results produced a strong improvement in segment roic segment revenues were million a decrease of million or percent from the prior year the decrease in revenue was driven by a lower prime rate lower average receivables higher finance charge and late fee write offs and lower late fees due to fewer delinquent accounts offset by the positive impacts of the terms changes implemented in late and april segment expenses were million a decrease of million or percent from prior year driven by lower bad debt and operations and marketing expenses on both a dollar and rate basis segment interest expense benefited from a significantly lower libor rate compared to the prior year segment profit and dollar spread to libor measures in were significantly impacted on both a rate and dollar basis by bad debt expense segment revenues were million an increase of million or percent from the prior year driven by a percent increase in average receivables on a rate basis revenue yield decreased percentage points primarily due to a reduction in the prime rate index used to determine finance charge rates in the portfolio and lower external sales volume contributing to the decline in third party merchant fees this negative pressure on revenue yield was offset modestly by the positive impact of terms changes implemented in that increased our effective yield segment expenses were million an increase of million or percent from the prior year driven by an increase in bad debt expense of million the increase in bad debt expense resulted from the increase in our incurred net write off rate from percent in to percent in and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of million for anticipated future write offs of current receivables segment profit decreased from percent in to percent in primarily due to the

of contents our period end gross credit card receivables were million compared with million in a decrease of percent average gross credit card receivables in decreased percent compared with levels this change was driven by tighter risk management and underwriting initiatives that have significantly reduced available credit lines for higher risk cardholders fewer new accounts being opened and a decrease in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests partially offset by the impact of a decline in payment rates our period end gross credit card receivables were million compared with million in an increase of percent average gross credit card receivables in increased percent compared with levels this growth was driven by the annualization of the prior year s product change from proprietary target cards to higher limit target visa cards and the impact of industry wide declines in payment rates offset in part by a reduction in charge activity resulting from reductions in card usage by our guests and from risk management and underwriting initiatives that significantly reduced credit lines for higher risk cardholders other performance factors net interest expense net interest expense was million at the end of decreasing percent or million from this decline was due to a decrease in the annualized average portfolio interest rate from percent to percent partially offset by a million charge related to the early retirement of long term debt in net interest expense was million compared with million in an increase of percent this increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances supporting capital investment share repurchase and the receivables portfolio partially offset by a lower average portfolio net interest rate provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent in and percent in the decrease in the effective rate between periods is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans in compared with nondeductible losses in the effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items our effective income tax rate for was percent compared with percent in the decrease in was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues the effective income tax rate was also lower due to a comparatively greater proportion of earnings subject to rate differences between taxing jurisdictions these rate declines were partially offset by lower capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation plans gains and losses from these investments are not taxable analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our operations were entirely funded by internally generated funds cash flow provided by operations was in compared with million in this strong cash flow allowed us to fund capital expenditures of million and pay off billion of maturing debt with internally generated funds in addition we accelerated the payoff of a million debt maturity restarted our share repurchase program earlier than expected and experienced a billion increase in marketable securities at january our period end gross credit card receivables were million compared with million in a decrease of percent average gross credit card receivables in decreased percent compared with levels this change was driven by the factors indicated in the credit card segment above this trend and the factors influencing it are likely to continue into due to the decrease in gross credit card receivables target receivables corporation trc using cash flows from the receivables repaid an affiliate of jpmorgan chase jpmc million during under the terms of our agreement with them as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements to the extent the receivables balance continues to decline trc expects to continue to pay jpmc a prorata portion of principal collections such that the portion owned by jpmc would not exceed percent table of contents year end inventory levels increased million or percent from primarily due to unusually low inventory levels at the end of in response to the challenging economic environment inventory levels were also higher to support traffic driving strategic initiatives such as food and pharmacy in addition to comparatively higher retail square footage accounts payable increased by million or percent over the same period during

repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total cash investment of million per share we paid dividends totaling million in and million in an increase of percent we declared dividends totaling million per share in an increase of percent over in we declared dividends totaling million per share an increase of percent over we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs maintaining strong investment grade debt ratings is a key part of our financing strategy our current debt ratings are as follows debt ratings standard and poor s moody s fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper p a f securitized receivables a aa a n a a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc at january and january there were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program in past years we funded our peak sales season working capital needs through our commercial paper program and then used the cash generated from that sales season to repay the commercial paper issued in we funded our working capital needs through internally generated funds additionally and as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements during we sold to jpmc an interest in our credit card receivables for approximately billion we received proceeds of approximately billion reflecting a percent discount an additional source of liquidity is available to us through a committed billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in april which will expire in april no balances were outstanding at any time during or under this facility most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at january no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and

remodeling of real estate and facilities purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases merchandise royalties equipment purchases marketing related contracts software acquisition license commitments and service contracts we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments therefore they are excluded from the table above we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditional on the purchase order not being cancelled if we choose to cancel a purchase order we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plans in the contractual obligations table above our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate further information on these plans including our expected contributions for is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources table of contents critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions however we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of saleswe use the retail inventory method to account for substantially our entire inventory and the related cost of sales under this method inventory is stated at cost using the last in first out lifo method as determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping s ending retail value cost includes the purchase price as adjusted for vendor income since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change relevant economic conditions include changing consumer demand customer preferences changing consumer credit markets or increasing competition we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months inventory is further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements vendor income receivablecost of sales and sga expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors this vendor income is earned for a variety of vendor sponsored programs such as volume rebates markdown allowances promotions and advertising allowances as well as for our compliance programs we establish a receivable for the vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of all year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter vendor income is described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accountswhen receivables are recorded we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to anticipated future write offs this allowance includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related fees we estimate future write offs based on historical experience of delinquencies risk scores aging trends and industry risk trends substantially all accounts continue to accrue finance charges until they are written off accounts are automatically written off when they become days past due management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card accounts receivable under current conditions however unexpected significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above or in general economic conditions could materially change these expectations credit card receivables are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements analysis of long lived and intangible assets for impairmentwe review assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows usually at the store level on an annual basis or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss on a long lived and identifiable intangible asset would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the asset carrying amount goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value to a fair value estimated by discounting future cash flows this test is performed at least annually or whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the table of contents carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable impairment on long lived assets of million in million in and million in were recorded as a result of the tests performed our estimates of future cash flows require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results real estate values and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict insurance self insurancewe retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claims however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported we estimate our ultimate cost based on an analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities referred to above are not discounted we believe that the amounts accrued are adequate although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided refer to item a for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures income taxeswe pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities historically our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been materially accurate the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements income taxes are described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement health care accountingwe fund and maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan we also maintain several smaller nonqualified plans and a postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team members the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs eligibility for and the level of these benefits varies depending on team members full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market conditions benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the long term rate of return used and a percent decrease in the expected long term rate of return used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities historically this same discount rate has also been used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense for the following plan year the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and benefits expense are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements benefits expense recorded during the year is partially dependent upon the discount rates used and a percent decrease to the weighted average discount rate used to determine net pension and postretirement health care benefits expense would increase annual expense by approximately million based on our experience we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team members than it does for older longer service pension eligible team members pension and postretirement health care benefits are further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements new accounting pronouncements future adoptions in june the fasb

under former fasb interpretation no r this guidance will be effective for the corporation beginning in fiscal and adoption is not anticipated to affect our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position outlook in the retail segment we expect to generate increases in comparable store sales likely in the range of to percent for the year including an expected percentage point lift from our remodel program while our comparable store sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall the expected incremental sales resulting from remodels will grow as the year progresses additionally we expect total sales to increase by a mid single digit percentage in we expect to generally preserve our ebit margin rate in our retail segment which if achieved would result in our retail segment ebit increasing in line with total sales growth in our credit card segment we expect the lower consumer usage of credit and our risk management strategies to continue throughout resulting in a low double digit percentage decline in gross credit card receivables by the end of the year we also expect to maintain segment profit on a dollar basis at generally the level earned in generating a higher pretax segment roic in than in we expect our book effective tax rate to approximate our long term structural rate likely in the range of to percent we also expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase authorization we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of to billion reflective of projects we will complete in as well as initial spending for our and new store programs our expectation is that our new store program will result in approximately new stores and that our new store program will be in the range of to stores due to the early repayment of an august debt maturity the only significant remaining maturity prior to our seasonal working capital peak which typically occurs in october or november is the million public series borrowing collateralized by our credit card receivables due in october forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include for our retail segment our outlook for sales expected merchandise returns comparable store sales trends and ebit margin rates for our credit card segment our outlook for year end gross credit card receivables portfolio size future write offs of current receivables profit roic and the allowance for doubtful accounts on a consolidated basis the expected effective income tax rate the continued

dividends the anticipated impact of new accounting pronouncements our expected future share based compensation expense our expected contributions and benefit payments related to our pension and postretirement health care plans and the adequacy of our reserves for general liability workers compensation property loss and team member medical and dental the expected outcome of claims and litigation and the resolution of tax uncertainties all such forward looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of as amended although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward looking statements our actual results could be materially different the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors in item a to this form k which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations some of which are at a libor plus floating rate and on our credit card receivables the majority of which are assessed finance charges at a prime based floating rate to manage our net interest margin we generally maintain levels of floating rate debt to generate similar changes in net interest expense as finance charge revenues fluctuate the degree of floating asset and liability matching may vary over time and in different interest rate environments at january the amount of floating rate credit card assets exceeded the amount of net floating rate debt obligations by approximately billion as a result based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on our floating rate debt obligations net of our floating rate credit card assets and marketable securities would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately million see further description in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we record our general liability and workers compensation liabilities at net present value therefore these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates periodically in certain interest rate environments we economically hedge a portion of our exposure to these interest rate changes by entering into interest rate forward contracts that partially mitigate the effects of interest rate changes based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized effect of a percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to decrease earnings before income taxes by approximately million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point decrease in the return on pension plan assets would decrease plan assets by million at january the value of our pension liabilities is inversely related to changes in interest rates to protect against declines in interest rates we hold high quality long duration bonds and interest rate swaps in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged approximately percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status as more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market returns on accumulated team member balances in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plans we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making investments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic exposure to the returns on these plans the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in market returns on our nonqualified defined contribution plans inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicles used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant we do not have significant direct exposure to foreign currency rates as all of our stores are located in the united states and the vast majority of imported merchandise is purchased in u s dollars overall there have been no material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year table of contents item financial statements and supplementary data report of management on the consolidated financial statements management is responsible for the consistency integrity and

our inventory costs or sga expenses based on the provisions of the arrangement promotional and advertising allowances are intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise in our stores under our compliance programs vendors are charged for merchandise shipments that do not meet our requirements violations such as late or incomplete shipments these allowances are recorded when violations occur substantially all consideration received is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on provisions of the agreements in place this receivable is computed by estimating the amount earned when we have completed our performance we perform detailed analyses to determine the appropriate level

fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable willing parties a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to

method of providing funding for our credit card receivables we sell on an ongoing basis all of our consumer credit card receivables to target receivables corporation trc a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary trc then transfers the receivables to the target credit card master trust the trust which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties either directly or through a related trust these debt table of contents securities represent undivided interests in the trust assets trc uses the proceeds from the sale of debt securities and its share of collections on the receivables to pay the purchase price of the receivables to the corporation we consolidate the receivables within the trust and any debt securities issued by the trust or a related trust in our consolidated statements of financial position based upon the applicable accounting guidance the receivables transferred to the trust are not available to general creditors of the corporation the payments to the holders of the debt securities issued by the trust or the related trust are made solely from the assets transferred to the trust or the related trust and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the corporation upon termination of the securitization program and repayment of all debt securities any remaining assets could be distributed to the corporation in a liquidation of trc in the second quarter of we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to jpmc the interest sold represented percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction this transaction was accounted for as a secured borrowing and accordingly the credit card receivables within the trust and the note payable issued are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial position notwithstanding this accounting treatment the accounts receivable assets that collateralize the note payable supply the cash flow to pay principal and interest to the note holder the receivables are not available to general creditors of the corporation and the payments to jpmc are made solely from the trust and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the corporation interest and principal payments due on the note are satisfied provided the cash flows from the trust assets are sufficient if the cash flows are less than the periodic interest the available amount if any is paid with respect to interest interest shortfalls will be paid to the extent subsequent cash flows from the assets in the trust are sufficient future principal payments will be made from jpmc s prorata share of cash flows from the trust assets in the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that jpmc s interest in the entire portfolio would exceed percent for three consecutive months trc using the cash flows from the assets in the trust would be required to pay jpmc a prorata amount of principal collections such that the portion owned by jpmc would not exceed percent unless jpmc provides a waiver conversely at the option of the corporation jpmc may be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their percent interest up to a maximum jpmc principal balance of billion if a three month average of monthly finance charge excess jpmc s prorata share of finance charge collections less write offs and specified expenses is less than percent of the outstanding principal balance of jpmc s interest the corporation must implement mutually agreed upon underwriting strategies if the three month average finance charge excess falls below percent of the outstanding principal balance of jpmc s interest jpmc may compel the corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities provided those activities are compatible with the corporation s systems as well as consistent with similar credit card receivable portfolios managed by jpmc if the corporation fails to implement the activities jpmc would cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in the transaction as noted in the preceding paragraph payments would be made solely from the trust assets inventory substantially all of our inventory and the related cost of sales are accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method rim using the last in first out lifo method inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market cost includes purchase price as reduced by vendor income inventory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns the lifo provision is calculated based on inventory levels markup rates and internally measured retail price indices under rim inventory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value inventory rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality the use of rim will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory we routinely enter into arrangements with vendors whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to a guest revenues under this program are included in sales in the consolidated statements of operations but the merchandise received under the program is not included in inventory in our consolidated statements of financial

value hedge accounting treatment the changes in market value of an interest rate swap as well as the offsetting change in market value of the hedged debt were recognized within earnings in the current period we assessed at the inception of the hedge whether the hedging derivatives were highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items ineffectiveness resulted when

significant tax rate reconciliation federal statutory rate state income taxes net of federal tax benefit other effective tax rate the decrease in the effective rates between and is primarily due to nontaxable capital market returns on investments used to economically hedge the market risk in deferred compensation obligations in compared with nondeductible losses in the effective income tax rate is also lower due to federal and state discrete items the decrease in was primarily due to tax reserve reductions resulting from audit settlements and the effective resolution of other issues the

liabilities for tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility because of the impact of deferred tax accounting other than interest and penalties the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the cash payment to the taxing authority to an earlier period during we will filea tax accounting method change allowed under applicable tax regulations that will determine the timing of deductions for one of our tax positions accordingly this change will result in a decrease in the unrecognized tax benefit liability of approximately million in the next twelve months additionally it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities with respect to other of our unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next twelve months however we do not currently expect any change to have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position during we filed income tax returns that included tax accounting method changes allowed under applicable tax regulations these changes resulted in a substantial increase in tax deductions related to property and equipment resulting in an increase in noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately

in a plan of this nature we also maintain a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan that was frozen during covering active and retired participants in this plan deferred compensation earns returns tied to market levels of interest rates plus an additional percent return with a minimum of percent and a maximum of percent as determined by the plan s terms the american jobs creation act of added section a to the internal revenue code changing the federal income tax treatment of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements failure to comply with the new requirements would result in early taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements as well as a percent penalty tax and additional interest payable to the irs in response to these new requirements we allowed

the nonqualified plans through investing in vehicles including company owned life insurance and prepaid forward contracts in our own common stock that offset a substantial portion of our economic

not an executives most recent employment within the corporation involved direct participation in the management of one or more business units this section will not be used to discourage or penalize otherwise suitable employment opportunities in retailing or otherwise the corporation may require as a condition of avoiding dce designation for the executive a suitable written undertaking by the executive and the new employer that the executive remains obliged not to use or divulge trade secrets or proprietary information of the corporation and that the executive will not volunteer or be expected or required to violate that obligation in the course of the new employment c relevant considerations in determining dce the ceo will give suitable consideration to geographic product and price line marketing overlaps the nature and content of the executives particular knowledge of strategies and plans within the corporation and the extent to which the executives knowledge as distinguished from skills is likely to be a significant factor in generating an employment opportunity employment exclusively with a component of a larger business entity which component is not presently or known to be planned to be a direct and immediate competitor of the executives former business unit will not be treated as dce merely because one or more other components of that entity is or may become a competitor of the corporation or one or more of its business units officer icp payment reduction uniform and responsible administration of officer icp will require reliable information
