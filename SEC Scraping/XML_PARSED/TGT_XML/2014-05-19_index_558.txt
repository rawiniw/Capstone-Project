governance and the board of directors corporate governance highlights at target we have actively supported strong corporate governance practices for decades many of the principles that provide the foundation for the practices and policies that guide us today were initiated by the dayton brothers during their tenure as our leaders our board of directors recognizes that our corporate governance practices must continually evolve to appropriately balance the interests of the board shareholders and management in order to effectively serve our guests team members shareholders and the communities in which we do business supporting that philosophy we have adopted many leading corporate governance practices including more practice description information board composition and accountability independence a majority of our directors must be independent currently all of our directors are independent and all of our committees consist exclusively of independent directors diversity of relevant experiences the composition of our board represents broad perspectives experiences and knowledge relevant to our business while maintaining a balanced approach to gender and ethnic diversity lead independent director our corporate governance guidelines require a lead independent director position with specific responsibilities to ensure independent oversight of management whenever our ceo is also the chair of the board annual management succession planning review our board conducts an annual review of management development and succession planning director tenure policies our director tenure policies include mandatory retirement at age a maximum term limit of years and a separate five year term limit for directors who retire from active employment in order to ensure the board regularly benefits from new fresh perspectives in addition a director is required to submit an offer of resignation for consideration by the board upon any change in the directors principal employment director overboarding policy our director overboarding policy requires a director to submit an offer of resignation for consideration by the board if the director becomes overboarded any director who is not serving as ceo of a public company is expected to serve on no more than five public company boards including our board and any director serving as a ceo of a public company is expected to serve

officer should be combined or separated instead the board prefers to maintain the flexibility to determine which leadership structure best serves the interests of target based on the circumstances however if the chair ceo roles are combined our corporate governance guidelines require that we have a lead independent director position to complement the chairs role and to serve as the principal liaison between the non management directors and the chair the board believes that there are many strong governance practices in place at target that balance any risk of concentration of authority that may exist with a combined chair ceo position including the requirement to have an independent lead director in those situations as recently announced roxanne s austin one of our independent directors was elected to the role of interim chair of the board by the independent directors in connection with the departure of our former chairman of the board president and ceo as interim chair of the board ms austin has primary responsibility for leading the board however because ms austin is currently serving as interim chair and no decision has been made to make the role of independent chair permanent the board determined that james a johnson should remain in the role of lead independent director to provide continuity during this period of transition and to work closely with ms austin in leading the board lead independent director annual election elected annually by the independent non management directors regular duties has the authority to convene meetings of the board and executive

place on an annual basis the board conducts a detailed review of management development and succession planning activities to maximize the pool of internal candidates who can assume top management positions without undue interruption in connection with the recent departure of our former president ceo the board appointed an experienced executive from that pool of internal candidates john j

longstanding commitment to and practice of maintaining diverse representation on the board board renewal and nomination process the nominating governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members and making recommendations on director nominees to the full board the committee considers the following two factors in its efforts to identify potential

the views expressed by shareholders at our annual meeting the board of directors has determined to seek an annual non binding advisory vote from shareholders to approve the executive compensation as disclosed in the compensation discussion analysis cda tabular disclosures and related narrative of this proxy statement our compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that encourages outstanding financial results and shareholder returns over the long term shareholders are urged to read the cda which discusses in depth how our executive compensation programs are aligned with our performance and the creation of shareholder value we have always believed that open dialogue with our shareholders is critical to our success and we take their feedback seriously at our june annual meeting of shareholders shareholders approved our say on pay proposal in support of our executive compensation program however the support level was well below what we deem to be acceptable as a result we embarked on a significant shareholder outreach effort to listen to concerns about our executive compensation plans and governance and we have taken specific actions in response to this feedback since our june say on pay vote we have held meetings or hosted calls with shareholders representing approximately of shares voted and two proxy advisory firms the majority of the conversations were led by either jim johnson lead independent director and chair of our boards compensation committee or anne mulcahy the chair of our boards nominating governance committee specifically the changes made by the compensation committee included reducing our former ceos pay decreasing our former ceos annual lti grant by nearly over the prior year paying to our former ceo for fiscal sti due to below threshold financial performance eliminating the age acceleration feature from our former ceos pension plan with no replacement value placing even greater emphasis on pay for performance discontinuing stock option grants increasing the psu portion of our annual lti mix from to replacing our rsus with pbrsus which now comprise the remaining of the annual lti mix and are essentially rsus tied to relative tsr adjusting our psu plan adding a third relative metric return on invested capital to create a balanced psu plan focused on the key metrics we use to manage our business and drive shareholder returns over time our comprehensive overhaul of our executive compensation program in fiscal as a result of what we viewed as an unacceptable level of support for our say on pay vote shows how seriously we consider our shareholders feedback we value the feedback provided by our shareholders and look forward to continued open dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business the board of directors upon recommendation of the compensation committee recommends that shareholders vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the shareholders approve the compensation awarded to the named executive officers as described in the cda tabular disclosures and other narrative executive compensation disclosures in this proxy statement proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents effect of item the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this item by shareholders will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding targets executive compensation practices the final decision on the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board believes that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interests of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of targets shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the resolution is non binding as evidenced by our outreach and response to the say on pay vote the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents item four shareholder proposal to eliminate perquisites richard j will anns choice way warminster pa who held more than of shares of common stock on october intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution i request that target corporations board of directors and compensation committee cease paying for perquisites for all named executives of the corporation starting in fiscal year shareholders supporting statement the definition of perquisite is a privilege of profit incidental to regular salary or wages i do not believe that targets named executives have demanded these payments with their income tax consequences such as gross ups nor would they be hard pressed to pay for the items in question in fact their total compensation seems to be sufficient to enable these executives to be able to pay easily for these perquisites targets compensation levels are about equal to walmarts which has times total revenue for most private and government employees reimbursements for car use personal use of company aircraft reimbursement of financial management expenses reimbursement of home security expenses on site parking on site exercise room spousal travel on business trips gifts and executive physicals would be against regulations or even illegal and could result in dismissal governor mcdonnell of virginia can attest to this outcome the value of perquisites is small compared to the high awards in the other categories of compensation however perquisites can have the potential to be excessively costly to shareholders if additional perquisites are covered in the future such as housing expenses personal travel legal services wills purchase of homes divorce and childrens weddings i realize that this suggestion covers some of the same subject matter as the yearly company advisory approval of executive compensation which is approved every year as such rule a would indicate that my proposal cannot be accepted however the yearly advisory approval of executive compensation is advisory only and nonbinding on the board and meaningless as such also shareholders are invited to express their opinions position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders as discussed on page target provides certain perquisites to executive officers primarily to allow them to devote more time to our business and promote their health safety and security all perquisites are taxable to the executive officers and no tax gross ups are provided the compensation committee reviews the level of perquisites on an annual basis and believes the perquisites target offers are consistent with market practice the compensation committee conducted a comprehensive review of all pay elements including perquisites as part of its outreach efforts following the say on pay vote the compensation committee determined that the perquisites we provide are appropriate while simultaneously undertaking considerable changes to other elements of program as described in our compensation discussion and analysis on page in addition the board believes that eliminating perquisites as called for by this proposal would put the company at a competitive disadvantage by eliminating a common pay element offered by many of our retail and general industry peers the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to eliminate perquisites proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents item five shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent

meeting resolution proposal independent board chairman resolved shareholders request that our board of directors to adopt a policy and amend other governing documents as necessary to reflect this policy to require the chair of our board of directors to be an independent member of our board this independence requirement shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligation at the time this resolution is adopted compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chair the policy should also specify how to select a new independent chairman if a current chairman ceases to be independent between annual shareholder meetings shareholders supporting statement when our ceo is our board chairman this arrangement can hinder our boards ability to monitor our ceos performance many companies already have an independent chairman an independent chairman is the prevailing practice in the united kingdom and many international markets this proposal topic won plus support at major u s companies in including support at netflix this topic is particularly important for target because our lead director james johnson received our highest negative votes and he is supposed to serve a check and balances role in regard to our chairman plus mr johnson chaired our executive pay committee million for our chairman gregg steinhafel and had years long tenure which detracts from director independence and mr johnson could be over burdened with director duties at companies anne mulcahy who chaired our nomination committee received our second highest negative votes plus ms mulcahy had years long tenure and could be over burdened with director duties at companies roxanne austin who chaired our audit committee could be over burdened with director duties at companies solomon trujillo had our longest tenure at years and had director duties at companies this proposal should also be more favorably evaluated due to our companys clearly improvable corporate governance performance as reported in gmi ratings an independent investment research firm gave target a d for its executive pay million for gregg steinhafel target was also incorporated in minnesota and gmi said minnesota law contains multiple provisions which protect management from hostile takeovers diminishing shareholder interests shareholders wishing to secure a large stake in target stock are also limited by minnesotas control share acquisition provision once a shareholder reaches a certain ownership threshold all further shares acquired are denied voting rights returning to the core topic of this proposal from the context of our clearly improvable corporate governance please vote to protect shareholder value independent board chairman proposal position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders the board believes that any decision to maintain a combined chair ceo role or to separate these roles should be based on the specific circumstances of a corporation the independence and capabilities of its directors and the leadership provided by its ceo the board does not believe that separating the roles of chair and ceo should be mandated or that such a separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for shareholders proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents the board believes that its current leadership structure and governance practices allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically our corporate governance guidelines require us to have a lead independent director with significant responsibilities that are described in detail on page whenever the roles of chair and ceo are combined our lead independent director is elected annually by the independent non management directors independent directors meet frequently in executive sessions that are presided over by our lead independent director with no members of management present independent directors use these executive sessions to discuss matters of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate including evaluation of the ceo and senior management management succession planning matters to be included on board agendas board informational needs and board effectiveness the chairpersonsand all membersof the audit nominating governance and compensation committees are independent directors these board committee chairpersons determine matters to be discussed and materials to be evaluated in the areas covered by their respective committee charters while our ceo has historically also served as chair of the board in connection with the recent departure of our former ceo our board elected an independent interim chair of the board the interim chair of the board has primary responsibility for leading the board however because no decision has yet been made to make the role of independent chair permanent the board determined that the role of lead independent director should remain to provide continuity during this period of transition the board expects to revisit our board leadership structure in connection with the appointment of a permanent ceo the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman item six shareholder proposal to adopt a policy prohibiting discrimination against or for persons thomas strobhar upper bellbrook road xenia ohio who held more than of shares of

following policy there shall be no discrimination against or discrimination for persons based on race religion gender or sexual orientation in hiring vendor contracts or customer relations except where required by law shareholders supporting statement the best way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race john roberts chief justice of the supreme court of the united states our country was founded on the principal of equality thousands of americans have given their last full measure of devotion for this principal we dishonor them by continuing practices that are inherently discriminatory we cannot discriminate for a particular group of persons for whatever reason without discriminating against another group let us resolve to commit our company to true equality proxy statementtarget corporation back to contents position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders because we already have policies and practices that the board believes substantially address the proposal our existing equal opportunity policy provides that our employment practices will be implemented without regard to race color national origin sex including pregnancy religious beliefs age disability sexual orientation gender identity or expression citizenship status military status genetic information or any other basis protected by federal state or local fair employment practice laws in addition our standards of vendor engagement require our vendors to comply with local laws and seek to eliminate workplace discrimination based on race gender personal characteristics or beliefs our policies and practices
