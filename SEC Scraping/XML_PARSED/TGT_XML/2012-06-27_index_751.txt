investment contracts in which the plan owns the underlying assets and purchases wrap contracts from independent third parties that provide market value and cash flow risk protection to the plan investment contracts held by a defined contribution plan are required to be reported at fair value however contract value is the relevant measurement attribute for that portion of the net assets available for benefits attributable to fully benefit responsive investment contracts as it reflects the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the plan the statements of net assets available for benefits present the fair value of the fund as well as the adjustment to contract value for the difference between the underlying funds fair value and contract value or the adjustment to contract value the synthetic gics are fully benefit responsive and are wrapped by two separate insurance companies which provide guarantees with respect to the return of funds to make distributions from this investment option the wrapper issuers are contractually obligated to repay the principal and a specified interest rate that is guaranteed to the plan there are no reserves against contract values for credit risk of the contract issuers or otherwise contributions to the fund are invested in a portfolio of collective trust funds as well as investments in the portfolio underlying the synthetic gics this portfolio includes short term investment funds high quality short term and intermediate term u s bonds including u s government treasuries corporate debt securities other high credit quality asset backed securities futures and interest rate swaps these investments are measured at fair value as described in note amounts due

synthetic gics underlying portfolio these amounts are factored table of contents target corporation k plan notes to financial statements continued stable value fund continued into the fair value of the underlying portfolio for purposes of calculating crediting rates and calculating the adjustment from fair value to contract value the fair value of the wrap contracts is the replacement cost of those contracts the synthetic gics contract value represents the sum of participants contributions plus earnings less participants withdrawals and administrative expenses participant accounts in the fund are credited with interest at a fixed rate that is evaluated quarterly the primary variables affecting the future crediting rates include the current yield of the assets underlying the contract the duration of the assets underlying the contracts and the existing difference between the fair value and the contract value of the assets within the insurance contract the crediting rate of security backed contracts will track current market yields on a trailing basis the rate reset allows the contract value to converge with the fair value of the underlying portfolio over time assuming the portfolio continues to earn the current yield for a period of time equal to the current portfolio duration to the extent that the underlying portfolio has unrealized and or realized losses a positive adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value under contract value accounting as a result the future crediting rate may be lower over time than the current market rates similarly if the underlying portfolio generates unrealized and or realized gains a negative adjustment is made when reconciling from fair value to contract value and in the future the crediting rate may be higher than the current market rates the insurance contracts cannot credit an interest rate that is less than derivative financial instruments are used by the fund principally to reduce exposures to interest rate and market risks in the synthetic gic underlying portfolio the fund invests in over the counter interest rate swaps to mitigate risks of interest rate fluctuations over the counter futures are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movements and to manage plan asset allocation derivative activity of the fund is within the portfolio underlying the synthetic gics and has no direct impact to the statements of net assets available for benefits or to the statements of changes in net assets available for benefits the fair value of the derivatives is an input to the
