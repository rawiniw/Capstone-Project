financial condition and results of operations in forms q and k instead the company will present its analysis of results of operations including an analysis of operating income on a consolidated basis for additional clarity of the impact of the new accounting standards the company is showing the impact using both its previous presentation of its analysis of results of operations including segment ebit and its planned future presentation of its analysis of consolidated operating income revenue recognitionthe company adopted accounting standards update asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic using the full retrospective approach adoption of the new revenue standard did not materially affect its consolidated net earnings financial position or cash flows the new standard primarily impacts the company s consolidated financial statements as follows reclassification of certain ancillary income streams including credit card profit sharing income from sales and selling general and administrative expenses sga to other revenue on its consolidated statements of operations andminor changes to the timing of revenue recognition primarily related to certain promotional gift card programs resulting in an adjustment to retained earnings of approximately million leasesthe company adopted asu no leases topic using the modified retrospective approach the new standard requires lessees to record assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position for all leases with terms longer than months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations the company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other things allowed it to carryforward the historical lease classification in addition the company elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases election of the hindsight practical expedient resulted in the shortening of lease terms for certain existing leases and the useful lives of corresponding leasehold improvements the company made an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of months or less off of its consolidated statements of financial position and will recognize those lease payments in its consolidated statements of operations on a straight line basis over the lease term adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately billion and billion respectively as of february the difference between the additional lease assets and lease liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings the standard did not materially affect the company s consolidated net earnings and had no impact on cash flows pensionsthe company adopted asu no compensation retirement benefits asc topic which requires employers to disaggregate and present separately the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost within the statement of operations the company retrospectively reclassified the other components of net benefit cost from sga to an other income and expense line on its consolidated statements of operations upon adoption refer to exhibit for
