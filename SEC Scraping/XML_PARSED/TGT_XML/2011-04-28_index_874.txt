sufficient number of votes to be elected he or she must promptly offer to resign and the nominating governance committee will make a recommendation on the offer and the board must accept or reject the offer within days and publicly disclose its decision and rationale nomination process the nominating governance committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members and making recommendations on director nominees to the full board the committee uses the board membership criteria set forth in our governance guidelines when evaluating director candidates under these criteria the committee seeks director candidates that have broad perspective experience knowledge and independence of judgment the committee evaluates candidates with reference to the overall composition of the board such that the board as a whole contains a predominance of business backgrounds with a diverse set of personal experiences and perspectives the committee does not have a specific policy regarding consideration of gender ethnic or other diversity criteria in identifying candidates however the board has had a longstanding commitment to and practice of maintaining diverse representation on the board the nominating governance committee will consider a recommendation by a shareholder of a candidate for election as a target director any shareholder who wishes the committee to consider a candidate should submit a written request and related information to our corporate secretary no later than december of the calendar year preceding the next annual meeting of

steinhafel in his role as chairman mr steinhafel is also the chief executive officer the board also has designated a lead independent director position to complement the chairman s role and to serve as the principal liaison between the non management directors and the chairman the board continues to believe that its current structure is the appropriate one for target at this time specifically the board believes that in light of target s clear strategy and the strength of its overall governance practices a combined chairman ceo role will more effectively unify the board and management around the specific initiatives to support target s strategy the board continues to separately evaluate mr steinhafel annually in each of his roles and it has retained the discretion to separate the chairman

concentration of authority that may exist with a combined chairman ceo position mr johnson functions as our lead independent director as lead director mr johnson presides at all meetings of the board of directors at which the chairman of the board is not present including executive sessions of non management directors conducts the annual performance reviews of the chief executive officer and

there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items and has the authority to convene meetings of non management directors at every meeting management succession planning one of the primary responsibilities of the board is to ensure that target has a high performing management team in place on an annual basis the board conducts a detailed review of management development and succession planning activities to maximize the pool of internal candidates who can assume top management positions without undue interruption in addition the board has adopted a ceo emergency succession policy to govern unforeseen succession needs risk oversight the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management the board s oversight of these risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the board s oversight of our business for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the board s regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with this strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and discusses with our senior executive officers the major events activities and challenges affecting their respective functional areas the board s ongoing oversight of risk in the context of specific aspects of our business is supplemented by a formal risk review process conducted jointly by our internal audit and corporate risk teams this review employs the coso framework for classifying identified risks in four primary categories strategic operational compliance and financial and facilitates consideration of our overall risk exposures strategic objectives and risk management programs in a holistic fashion this formal risk review has been discussed with the full board and will continue to be reviewed by the board on a regular basis the oversight of risks also occurs at the board committee level on a more focused basis as described in the description of each committee s responsibilities compensation policies and risk as part of our regular review of our compensation practices we conducted an analysis of whether our compensation policies and practices create material risks to the company the results of this analysis were reviewed by the compensation committee s independent consultant and discussed with the compensation committee which agreed with management s conclusion that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company more specifically this conclusion was based on the following considerations pay mix compensation mix of base salary short term and long term incentives provides compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our incentive structure with near term and long term strategic goals performance metrics a variety of performance metrics are used in both the short term and long term incentive plans this portfolio approach to performance metrics encourages focus on sustained overall company performance additional detail on our performance metrics can be found in the compensation discussion and analysis performance goals goals are approved by our independent directors and take into account our historical performance current strategic initiatives and the expected macroeconomic environment in addition long term and short term incentive plans are designed with payout curves and leverage that support our pay for performance philosophy equity incentives equity incentive programs and stock ownership guidelines are designed to align management and shareholder interests by providing vehicles for executives to accumulate and maintain an ownership position in the company risk mitigation policies we incorporate several risk mitigation policies into our officer compensation program including the compensation committee s ability to use negative discretion to determine appropriate payouts under formula based plans a clawback policy to recover incentive compensation that was based on inaccurate financial statements and stock ownership guidelines for executives supplemented with an anti hedging policy for executive officers committees the board has the following

committee has reviewed and discussed the following compensation discussion and analysis with management based on this review and discussion the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in our annual report on form k and this proxy statement compensation committee jamesa johnson chair calvin darden maryn dillon stephenw sanger compensation discussion and analysis executive summary our compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and its competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that delivers outstanding financial results over the long term in addition to an alignment with shareholders our compensation programs and principles are based on a pay for performance philosophy in which variable compensation represents a majority of an executive s potential compensation and includes a commitment to balanced short and long term performance metrics and sound governance the chart below demonstrates that our performance has resulted in returns to target shareholders that are above the median returns delivered by our retail peer group as defined on page over varying time horizons total shareholder return data source bloomberg total shareholder return period ending january overall our performance is the result of an unwavering adherence to our strategic priorities and a thoughtful approach to planning and execution we achieved very strong financial results in that were above management s and the financial community s expectations for performance when the year began our fully diluted earnings per share eps for was the highest eps performance in our history eclipsing our previous record annual eps by percent comparing our eps result of for or per share excluding net favorable discrete tax items to the firstcall median eps estimate of at the start of the year highlights the strength of our execution in the last fiscal year these results reflect the attainment of our retail segment objectives in a volatile environment and exceeding expectations in our credit card segment in our retail segment we successfully implemented two key growth strategies in our pfresh remodel program and our national launch of rewards retail segment operating margins remained very strong and combined with our careful expense management across the organization we replicated the high ebitda and ebit margin rate performance we achieved in in the credit card segment disciplined underwriting outstanding execution and an improving risk environment led to a rapid improvement in bad debt expense as a result credit card segment profit more than doubled and the pre tax return on our investment in the portfolio nearly tripled to just under percent strong cash generation by our business segments and a strong balance sheet allowed us to return billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase representing more than percent of our net income for the year compensation decisions for the named executive officers neos in as presented in our executive officer compensation actions table on page were consistent with our pay for performance philosophy coupled with strong fiscal year business results specifically base pay increases were modest except for ms tesija who was given additional responsibilities our fiscal results produced short term incentive sti compensation that was above goal and long term incentive lti grant increases were modest and reflected additional compensation for the delivery of strong results in in broad terms our compensation programs for executive officers which are reviewed by our independent compensation committee and its advisor semler brossy consulting group llc sbcg focus on performance based criteria and reflect the competitive environment in which we operate more specifically we establish sti plan payout levels to provide an opportunity for compensation payments in the upper quartile of the marketplace when financial performance goals are exceeded and for significantly reduced compensation when our financial performance is below expectations incorporate a mix of variable cash and equity compensation elements with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance this approach aligns with shareholder interests by focusing on shareholder value creating performance measures such as market share earnings per share eps earnings before interest and taxes ebit and economic value add eva provide a competitive package of long term performance based and time vested equity compensation and retirement plans to facilitate retention and provide opportunities to realize future value in addition we continued our focus on sound corporate governance in our pay practices by conducting a rigorous compensation risk assessment with the review of the board s independent compensation consultant sbcg maintaining stock ownership guidelines a clawback policy and anti hedging policy for executives abstaining from utilizing employment contracts and not providing tax gross ups to our executive officers compensation determination competitive market analysis specific total direct compensation tdc levels for each executive officer are evaluated annually relative to our retail and general industry group companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data

benchmark of companies generating profitable market share growth over time general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and among the leaders in their industries the composition of the peer groups is reviewed annually to ensure it is appropriate in terms of company size and business focus and any changes made are reviewed with sbcg and approved by the compensation committee for the following changes were approved altria group and medtronic were removed from the general industry peer group and were replaced with dell and united technologies dell and united technologies more closely match target from revenue competition for talent and business focus perspectives wells fargo s market data was reinstated after being withheld last year while their compensation was impacted by tarp regulations setting amount of compensation and allocation among elements tdc for our executive officers is determined by the sum of three compensation elements base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation when determining executive officer tdc many factors are considered to ensure the packages are in line with our pay for performance philosophy while remaining competitive in the market for talent we consider individual factors such as individual performance experience internal comparison and compensation history peer group market positioning is another important factor considered in determining each executive officer s tdc due to imprecise comparability of executive positions between companies peer group market position is used as a reference point in the tdc determination process rather than a formula driven outcome in general we have established tdc at levels above the median levels of our peer groups and for more experienced executives including all of the neos at levels that are in the upper quartile of these peer groups specifically the following considerations are utilized when determining executive officer tdc packages and form the basis for our decision to use above median tdc levels job scopethe job scope of our executives is broad and complex we have vertical integration where we manage our own international sourcing operations directly import a significant percentage of our inventory and develop and manage our owned brand offerings we also have supply chain complexity with the variety of categories we offer in our stores from perishable food products to apparel and linens to electronics and movies to pharmacies further we maintain a flat organizational structure resulting in greater executive officer involvement and insight into the business resulting in high performance expectations of our executive officers sizewith respect to the retail peer group in all metrics and for our general industry peer group with respect to revenue and number of employees we are among the largest companies in the peer groups pay at riskpay at risk short term and long term incentive compensation represents a higher percentage of tdc for our executive officers in comparison to the retail and general industry peer groups for our ceo and other neos and of tdc is pay at risk respectivelyaligning pay with company financial and or stock price performance talentwe seek to attract and retain the best available management talent to protect and advance the iconic target brand long term performanceas illustrated in the chart on page our total shareholder return over various time horizons has outpaced the median of our retail peer group all five of our neos have been officers of the company over the year time horizon four of the five have been executive officers since at least and have had a direct impact on long term company performance because some compensation elements have a performance based variable payout feature we determine tdc using at goal levels of payouts which many companies refer to as target levels of performance in other words we assume at goal payout levels under our short term incentive program and for determining the value of performance share unit psu awards all equity awards are valued at their grant date fair value for purposes of determining tdc the actual tdc earned by executives will vary significantly depending on our performance which is explained further in the pay for performance section beginning on page we allocate tdc among the compensation elements by considering market data from our peer group companies this is done both by direct comparison of the amount of each element with peer group company data and also using data on the relative weightings of different elements by our peer companies this market data is used to establish a range for each element that is used as a reference point to determine a final compensation opportunity that is in line with market conditions yet maintains a strong bias in favor of long term and performance based compensation element objective details base salary to compensate each executive officer based on the size and scope of his or her position individual expertise experience and performance base salaries for our neos in are positioned in the upper quartile of our retail peer group this positioning is reflective of the scope and complexity of our executive roles relative to the retail peer group the individual s skill contribution and tenure with the company and positions us appropriately in the competitive market for this caliber of talent short term

primary driver of the overall value of the tdc packages the following chart highlights the variability of our compensation by showing tdc at goal and the value of the tdc package for our ceo one year

ebit and eva results at below goal with stock price depreciation ceo tdc variability our other neo s tdc packages exhibita similar level of variability with this backdrop the remainder of this section discusses in greater detail each component of tdc and its performance components executive compensationkey performance measures and performance goals our incentive programs use a combination of revenue profit share price appreciation and return on investment metrics with semi annual annual three year and longer time horizons to provide a balanced assessment of our performance over time and ensure that our compensation performance metrics support our financial and strategic objectives the combination of base salary short term incentive and long term incentive pay mix is designed to encourage thoughtful but not excessive risk taking for each performance measure we set a goal level of performance that is approved in advance by our compensation committee and independent directors and takes into consideration the financial performance of our peer companies actual performance against these goals determines the amount if any of payments to executive officers under our short term and long term incentive compensation plans the following sections describe the performance measures used under our short term and long term incentive compensation plans in the financial or strategic objective they are intended to reinforce and the compensation element s with which they are aligned short term incentives incentive opportunities under our short term incentive compensation plan are based on percentages of an executive officer s base salary that are tied to objective financial performance measures used under the plan and for executive officers other than our ceo their subjectively determined personal performance level incentive ebitone of two financial performance measures for payments under our annual short term incentive plan this measurement is designed to reinforce our focus on the growth in our earnings before interest and taxes and accounts for of the short term incentive plan payout incentive ebit is retail ebit plus credit spread to libor see credit spread to libor definition and discussion in item of the form k because the majority of our credit card receivables portfolio earns interest based on a variable interest rate changes in interest rates affect finance charge revenues that in turn affect reported ebit accordingly we adjust ebit to generally eliminate the effect of interest rate fluctuations either up or down on incentive plan calculations investment discipline eva eva is the other financial performance measure for payments under our annual short term incentive plan and accounts for the other of the plan payout eva is a measure of earnings after an estimated after tax cost of capital charge and is used to evaluate the degree to which capital is being efficiently invested the effective tax rate used to calculate eva is fixed to prevent future tax volatility from having an unintended effect on payouts a positive eva performance indicates we are generating returns on invested capital at rates higher than the cost of capital among other things our use of eva helps us temper the objective of increasing revenues through new store construction with a measure of how profitably we are investing in new stores in calculating eva we use an annualized after tax blended cost of debt and equity capital of for capital used to fund our core retail operations and approximately for capital used to fund our credit card operations personal performanceall executive officers are eligible to earn a personal performance payment for all executive officers other than our ceo personal performance payments

performance component of our short term incentive plan are based on subjective management criteria including the executive officer s ability to develop a high performing team their ability to lead strategic priorities and their demonstration of a strong commitment to high ethical standards we include this subjective element within our mix of variable compensation elements to recognize the critical factors upon which we believe performance should be judged but which are not quantifiable or linked to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the compensation committee approved our ceo s recommended personal review scores for executive officers ceo discretionary awardthe board awarded mr steinhafel a discretionary personal performance payment of million for compared to an award

in our short term incentive plan are reported in the non equity incentive plan compensation column long term incentives we believe consistent execution of our strategy over multi year periods will lead to an increase in our stock price stock options psus and rsus are the variable equity instruments we use to incent our executive officers to have this long term focus and potential reward for their successful efforts the actual compensation realized from stock options and rsus is dependent on increases in our stock price after the grant dates the value of our psu award payouts have varied significantly over the last five years and are aligned with our financial performance for the three year period ending with each final performance year in addition the value of psu awards is also dependent on stock price performance over time the following chart illustrates long term equity incentive payouts for psu awards with final performance years from to in relation to originally targeted goal payouts the following outlines our psu plan measures and performance criteria for current outstanding psu awards long term equity incentive plan grants prior to payouts of psus granted prior to

domestic net sales market share growth and eps growth each measure determines half of the award the decision to move to relative measures for psu payouts is intended to ensure that our compensation performance metrics include not only performance against our own internal absolute benchmarks but also performance relative to that of our competitors absolute measures that were used in the past

responsible for determining the composition and value of our non ceo executive officer pay packages and for developing a recommendation for our ceo s pay package that is reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full board the committee receives assistance from two sources an independent compensation consulting firm sbcg and our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president of human resources sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target compensation recommendations for executive officers are made to the committee in two separate ways with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the committee s consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies on its understanding of target s business and compensation programs and sbcg s independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with our ceo with respect to his compensation for other executive officers our executive vice president of human resources works with our ceo to develop our ceo s compensation recommendations to the committee in developing these recommendations the executive vice president of human resources provides our ceo with market data on pay levels and compensation design practices provided by management s external compensation consultants covering the peer group companies management s outside consultant does not have any interaction with either the committee or our ceo but does interact with the executive vice president of human resources and her staff in addition to providing market data management s external compensation consultant performs other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation the final recommendations to the committee are determined by our ceo and include a recommendation with respect to the compensation of the executive vice president of human resources importantly sbcg provides the committee with sbcg s independent view of our ceo s compensation recommendations all decisions regarding executive compensation and final recommendations to the independent members of the full board are made solely by the committee recoupment policy our recoupment or clawback policy which covers all officers allows for recovery of the following compensation elements all amounts paid under the short term incentive plan includes discretionary component that were paid with respect to any fiscal year that is restated and all awards under the long term incentive plan whether exercised vested unvested or deferred all demands for repayment are subject to compensation committee discretion for an officer to be subject to recovery or cancellation under this policy he or she must have engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the need for a restatement of the corporation s consolidated financial statements anti hedging policy executive officers and members of the board of directors may not directly or indirectly engage in capital transactions intended to hedge or offset the market value of target common stock owned by them policies on equity compensation general our use of equity compensation is intended to enhance the alignment of executive and shareholder interests and also to provide a means for our executives and directors to accumulate an ownership stake in target our executive officer and director stock ownership guidelines and their current ownership positions are discussed on pages of this proxy statement our compensation committee recognizes that the use of equity as a form of compensation can result in potential shareholder dilution all of our equity compensation awards are granted under a shareholder approved plan our long term incentive plan on an annual basis the committee reviews and approves an aggregate pool of shares that are available for grant and in doing so reviews metrics relating to both the annual grant rate and the cumulative dilutive impact of outstanding awards in addition the plan expressly prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option without shareholder approval individual grants to executive officers must be approved by the compensation committee the compensation committee has delegated authority to make grants to team members below the executive officer level to our ceo grant timing policy we have the following practices regarding the timing of equity compensation grants which includes stock option exercise price determinations these practices have not been formalized in a written policy but they are strictly observed stock options and rsus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled january compensation committee meeting psus are granted on the date of our regularly scheduled march compensation committee meeting in order to align the grant date of the award with our financial goal setting process these meetings are scheduled more than one year in advance we set the exercise price of stock awards at the volume weighted average trading price of our stock on the grant date we believe that the volume weighted average price is a better measure of the fair value of our shares than the closing price on the grant date as it eliminates the effect of any variations in stock price that may occur in the final minutes of trading if the closing price were used we have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around our grant dates our information releases are handled in a process completely separate from our equity grants on occasion we make equity compensation grants outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires promotions and recognition or retention purposes all such grants have an effective date on or after the date of approval if the grant date is after the date of approval it is on a date specified at the time of approval additional compensation elements we offer additional compensation elements designed to encourage retention of key talent these elements include pension plan k and deferred compensation plan details on each of these elements of our compensation programs are provided in the tables that follow the summary compensation table beginning on page perquisites we provide certain perquisites to our executive officers principally to allow them to devote more time to company business and to promote their health and safety the compensation committee reviews these perquisites annually to ensure they are consistent with our philosophy and appropriate in magnitude the personal use of our aircraft is provided to our ceo for security reasons other perquisites are described on pages of this proxy statement employment contracts none of our executive officers including our ceo have employment contracts income continuance we have an income continuance policy icp that is provided to executives who are involuntarily terminated without cause because we believe it is appropriate to provide continued income to assist in their occupational transition the maximum payment under this policy paid during regular pay cycles over two years is two times the sum of base salary plus the average of the last three years of personal performance and short term incentive plan payments tax considerationscode section m our compensation programs are designed to allow us to comply with the tax deductibility limitations of section m of the internal revenue code in the following ways under a shareholder

approved plan and intended to qualify as deductible performance based compensation summary compensation table the summary compensation table below contains values calculated and disclosed according to sec reporting requirements salary bonus and non equity incentive plan compensation amounts are reflective of the compensation earned during the fiscal year the stock awards and option awards reflect

stock award of million in march which represented his fiscal bonus of million and a portion of his fiscal non equity incentive plan compensation because this stock award was granted during fiscal it is reported in the stock awards column of the summary compensation table for fiscal rather than fiscal the all other compensation amount for mr steinhafel includes supplemental pension plan benefits that are credited to his deferred compensation account two factors caused these benefits to be increased in both of which relate to the fact that he turned age during calendar first a plan feature that is common to all participants in our pension plans that seeks to retain executives and team members by providing an enhanced pension benefit upon attainment of age second mr steinhafel became eligible for benefits under a longstanding supplemental pension plan sppiii which has been frozen to new participants since additional details regarding the spp iii benefit can be found on pages the table below shows the impact of these enhanced benefits the primary remaining factor for the increase in the pension benefits is the application of our normal pension formula which utilizes the highest years of annual cash compensation base salary non equity incentive and bonus amounts only in the last years for mr steinhafel this had the effect of including his higher cash compensation received in calendar in place of a year in which he was not the ceo age enhanced benefits spp iii normal pension formula total mr steinhafel amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of

plan which is a tax qualified retirement plan that provides retirement benefits to our employees who are at least years of age have completed at least three years of service and in general were hired prior to january we also provide benefits under supplemental pension plans as described below because of limits imposed on tax qualified plans by the internal revenue code benefits under those plans are reflected in the nonqualified deferred compensation table the final average pay normal retirement benefit under the pension plan expressed as a monthly single life annuity commencing at age is

value of the accumulated benefit is based on the same assumptions and valuation dates used for the valuation of pension plan liabilities in our financial statements participants can elect other annuity forms that have an actuarially equivalent value we do not grant extra years of service to supplement retirement benefits the pension plan allows for early retirement payments to commence at age a participant who terminates employment before age has his or her vested benefit calculated based on the final average monthly pay as of their termination date but service is projected to age the vested benefit is then multiplied by the ratio of the participant s actual completed service to their projected service through age the result will always be equal to or less than the vested benefit as of the termination date benefits are also reduced for early commencement by per year between age and age and per year between age and age based upon the participant s age when benefits commence the

equivalent lump sum value that was transferred to the edcp each year the annual change in the actuarial lump sum amount is calculated and added to or deducted from the participant s edcp account this same calculation and an edcp account adjustment also occurs upon termination of employment to determine the amount of the change in actuarial equivalent lump sum amount the prior transfers are adjusted by an assumed annual earnings rate based on the rate of return of the stable value fund crediting rate alternative in edcp actuarial equivalents are determined using the discount methodology we use in calculating lump sum payments under the pension plan currently we use the applicable interest rate and mortality factors under section e of the internal revenue code published in the month

objectives and the market upon shareholder approval of the plan we will cease making awards under our current long term incentive plan referred to as the prior plan shareholder approval of the plan

one year for performance based awards and includes an explicit prohibition on repricing new terms in plan requires that any dividend equivalents paid on awards that have performance based vesting conditions be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying shares and prohibits dividend equivalents on stock options and stock appreciation rights eliminates certain share counting rules that allow shares delivered or withheld to pay the exercise price or satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with an award to return to the shares available for issuance and contemplates that

to those advisors or consultants to the company and its subsidiaries who the compensation committee determines will contribute to the growth and performance of the company for the benefit of shareholders the plan is also intended to facilitate recruiting and retaining team members of outstanding ability plan administration our independent compensation committee the committee will administer all aspects of the plan the committee is composed of persons who are both non employee directors as defined under rule b of the securities exchange act of as amended and outside directors within the meaning of section m all of the members of the committee also meet the director independence criteria established by the nyse the committee has the authority to among other things select

criteria and restrictions of the awards and whether the awards are settled in cash or shares administer outstanding awards including approval of any amendment to an award and establish rules interpreting the plan the committee may delegate its authority to a subcommittee of directors and or for purposes of determining and administering awards to persons who are not subject to the reporting requirements of section of the securities exchange act of officers of the company eligibility any officer employee director advisor or individual consultant of the company or any of its

have over employees and the company currently has non employee directors the selection of participants and the nature and size of grants and awards are within the discretion of the committee subject to the terms of the plan consequently we cannot specifically identify those employees directors or other participants to whom awards may be granted under the plan since no such determination has been made types of awards dividends and dividend equivalents the plan provides for the grant of non qualified stock options incentive stock options stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock restricted stock units and performance awards which can include performance shares performance share units and performance units the plan permits dividends on restricted stock if determined by the

the same restrictions as the underlying units authorized shares individual limits the plan authorizes the issuance of shares as of march an aggregate of shares remained available for grant under the prior plan and an aggregate of shares were subject to outstanding grants under our prior equity compensation plans including the prior plan in determining the number of shares that remain available for grant each stock option or stock appreciation right granted under the plan will reduce the number of shares available for grant by one share for every one share granted and except as provided below each award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right referred to as a full value award will reduce the number of shares available for grant by two shares for every one share granted if two awards are granted in tandem so that only awards of one type can be exercised only the award that would result in the higher reduction of the number of shares available will be counted any shares of common stock subject to an award under the plan or to an award under the prior plan that is outstanding on the date the plan was originally adopted that expires is forfeited or is settled or exchanged for cash or other property will to the extent of such expiration forfeiture settlement or exchange automatically again become available for issuance under the plan each share that again becomes available for issuance will be added back as i one share if the share was subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under either the plan or the prior plan or ii as two shares if the share was subject to a full value award under the plan or the prior plan however any shares tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with any award any shares we repurchase using option exercise proceeds and any shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on its exercise may not be used again for new grants awards granted under the plan upon the assumption of or in substitution for outstanding equity awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the company or any of its subsidiaries will not reduce the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan additionally if a company acquired by the company or any of its subsidiaries has shares available under a pre existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of that pre existing plan may be used for awards under the plan and will not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the plan but only if the shares are used for awards made to individuals who were not employed by or providing services to the company or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition a participant cannot during any consecutive month period be granted awards under the plan that could result in the individual receiving earning or acquiring stock options and stock appreciation rights in the aggregate for more than shares of common stock stock settled performance awards restricted stock and restricted stock units in the aggregate for more than shares of common stock and cash settled performance units with a value exceeding award terms stock options the committee may grant to participants options to purchase common stock that qualify as incentive stock options for purposes of section of the internal revenue code incentive stock options options that do not qualify as incentive stock options non qualified stock options or a combination thereof the terms and conditions of stock option grants including the number of shares exercise price vesting periods and other conditions on exercise will be determined by the committee the per share exercise price for stock options will be determined by the committee in its discretion but may not be less than the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date when the stock option is granted additionally in the case of incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the date of grant the exercise price may not be less than of the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date the stock option is granted on march the fair market value of a share of common stock was based on the closing sale price of our common stock on the nyse on such date stock options must be exercised within a period fixed by the committee that may not exceed ten years from the date of grant except where an employee terminates due to death and has one full year to exercise following his or her death at the committee s discretion payment for shares of common stock on the exercise of stock options may be made in cash in shares of our common stock held by the participant by withholding a number of shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise of the option or in any manner acceptable to the committee including one or more forms of broker assisted cashless exercise stock appreciation rights the committee may grant to a participant an award of stock appreciation rights which entitles the participant to receive upon its exercise a payment equal to i the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date over the stock appreciation right exercise price times ii the number of shares of common stock with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised the payment upon exercise of a stock appreciation right may be in cash shares of common stock or any combination thereof as approved by the committee in its sole discretion the per share

exception as described above for stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units the committee may award to a participant shares of common stock subject to specified restrictions shares of restricted stock are subject to forfeiture if the participant does not meet certain conditions such as continued employment over a specified vesting period subject to limited exceptions for certain termination events and or the attainment of specified company performance objectives over a specified performance period the committee also may award to a participant restricted stock units each representing the right to receive in the future in cash and or shares of our common stock as determined by the committee the fair market value of a share of common stock subject to the achievement of one or more goals relating to the completion of a specified period of service by the participant and or the achievement of specified performance or other objectives the terms and conditions of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are determined by the committee performance awards the committee may grant awards subject to performance based vesting conditions and other restrictions the performance award may be made in the form of a number of shares a right to receive a number of shares or a cash amount the performance award will typically set a nominal payout amount and may provide for variable payout amounts based on performance above or below the performance threshold corresponding to the nominal payout amount for awards subject to performance based vesting conditions the committee establishes the performance goals on or before the date of grant of the award and within a reasonable period of time after the beginning of the performance period the committee also establishes the performance period not less than one year and the amount payable at various performance levels at any time prior to payment the committee can adjust awards for the effect of unforeseen events that have a substantial effect on the performance goals and would otherwise make application of the performance goals unfair however the committee may not increase the amount that would otherwise be payable under an award intended to constitute performance based compensation under section m of the internal revenue code the performance goals are set at the sole discretion of the committee and may be based upon criteria including one or more of the following net sales comparable store sales total revenue gross margin rate selling general and administrative expense rate earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization earnings before interest and taxes earnings before taxes net earnings earnings per share target corporation share price total shareholder return return on equity return on sales return on assets return on invested capital cash flow return on investment economic value added credit card segment profitability credit card

amortization and rent expense ratio debt leverage total net debt the specific performance goals may be absolute in their terms on a per share basis as a growth rate or change from preceding periods or as a comparison to the performance of specified companies or other external measures and may relate to one or any combination of corporate group unit division subsidiary or individual performance changes in capitalization and fundamental changes change in control in the event of a change in the company s capitalization that constitutes an equity restructuring such as a stock split the committee will make adjustments to the number of authorized shares and the individual limitations set forth above and the committee may but need not make adjustments in the case of other changes in the event of certain fundamental changes such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets the committee may provide for assumption of outstanding awards by the successor entity or cash out stock options and stock appreciation rights based on the consideration to be received by shareholders in the fundamental change transaction unless otherwise provided in an award agreement the plan provides for single trigger acceleration of stock options and sars if the awards are not assumed or replaced in a change in control and double trigger acceleration if the awards are assumed or replaced in the case of double trigger acceleration the award will become exercisable if within two years of the change in control the participant s employment is terminated without cause or for good reason for this purpose cause is defined in any agreement with the participant or otherwise means the participant s deliberate and serious disloyal or dishonest conduct in the course of employment that justifies and results in prompt discharge under the company s policies and practices a termination is for good reason if the participant s position authority duties or responsibilities are significantly diminished the participant s compensation incentive opportunities or aggregate employee benefits are reduced or if the participant is required to work at a place that is more than miles from the participant s principal work site prior to the change in control unless otherwise provided in an award agreement the plan provides for pro rated acceleration of restricted stock restricted stock units and performance awards based on the number of months that have elapsed in the applicable restriction or performance period prior to the change in control and the denominator will be the number of months in the restriction or performance period in the case of performance awards the pro rata fraction is multiplied by of the performance award which is the nominal payout amount term the plan has a year term that will expire on march or any earlier termination of the plan by the board or the distribution of all shares under the plan amendment or termination the board may terminate or amend the plan at any time except that shareholder approval is required for any amendment that requires shareholders approval under the rules of the nyse except as required by law termination or amendment of the plan may not materially impair the rights of any participant without his or her consent in addition no underwater option or stock appreciation right may be repriced in any manner except for anti dilution adjustments without shareholder approval withholding distributions under the plan are subject to any required withholding taxes and other withholdings the plan provides that the company may require a participant to pay cash to cover required withholdings or pay part or all of the withholdings by having shares of common stock withheld or by tendering already owned shares of common stock having a market value equal to the required withholding federal income tax consequences the following summary constitutes a brief overview of the principal u s federal income tax consequences relating to awards that may be granted under the plan based upon current tax laws this summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe state local or foreign tax consequences non qualified stock options a participant will realize no taxable income at the time a non qualified option is granted under the plan but generally at the time such non qualified option is exercised the participant will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the option exercise price upon a disposition of such shares the difference between the amount received and the fair market value on the date of exercise will generally be treated as a long term or short term capital gain or loss depending on the holding period of the shares the company will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes at the same time and in the same amount as the participant is considered to have realized ordinary income in connection with the exercise of a non qualified option incentive stock options a participant will realize no taxable income and the company will not be entitled to any related deduction at the time any incentive stock option is granted if certain employment and holding period conditions are satisfied then no taxable income will result upon the exercise of such option and the company will not be entitled to any deduction in connection with such exercise upon disposition of the shares after expiration of the statutory holding periods any gain realized by a participant will be taxed as long term capital gain and any loss sustained will be long term capital loss and the company will not be entitled to a deduction in respect to such disposition while no ordinary taxable income is recognized at exercise unless there is a disqualifying disposition see below the excess of the fair market value of the shares over the option exercise price is a preference item that is recognized for alternative minimum tax purposes except in the event of death if shares acquired by a participant upon the exercise of an incentive stock option are disposed of by such participant before the expiration of the statutory holding periods i e a disqualifying disposition such participant will be considered to have realized as compensation taxed as ordinary income in the year of such disposition an amount not exceeding the gain realized on such disposition equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise of such option generally any gain realized on the disposition in excess of the amount treated as compensation or any loss realized on the disposition will constitute capital gain or loss respectively if a participant makes a disqualifying disposition generally in the fiscal year of such disqualifying disposition the corporation will be allowed a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the compensation realized by such participant if the participant pays the option price with shares that were originally acquired pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option and the statutory holding periods for such shares have not been met the optionee will be treated for tax purposes as having made a disqualifying disposition of such shares exercise with shares an optionee who pays the purchase price upon exercise of an option in whole or in part by delivering already owned shares of the company s common stock will generally not recognize gain or loss on the shares surrendered at the time of such delivery except under certain circumstances relating to incentive stock options rather such gain or loss recognition will generally occur upon disposition of the shares acquired in substitution for the shares surrendered sars a grant of sars has no federal income tax consequences at the time of grant upon the exercise of sars the value of the shares and cash received is generally taxable to the grantee as ordinary income and the company generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction restricted stock a participant receiving restricted stock under the plan may be taxed in one of two ways the participant i pays tax when the restrictions lapse or ii makes a special election to pay tax in the year the grant is made at either time the value of the award for tax purposes is the excess of the fair market value of the shares at that time over the amount if any paid for the shares this value is taxed as ordinary income and is subject to income tax withholding the company receives a tax deduction at the same time and for the same amount taxable to the participant if a participant elects to be taxed at grant then when the restrictions lapse there will be no further tax consequences attributable to the awarded stock until disposition of the stock restricted stock units in general no taxable income is realized by a participant in the plan upon the grant of a restricted stock unit award such participant generally would include in ordinary income the fair market value of the award of stock at the time shares of stock are delivered to the participant the company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction at the time and in the amount that the participant recognizes ordinary income performance shares the participant will not realize income when a performance share is granted but will realize ordinary income when shares and cash are transferred to the participant the amount of such income will be equal to the fair market value of such transferred shares on the date of transfer and the cash received in lieu of shares the company will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes at the same time and in the same amount as the participant is considered to have realized ordinary income as a result of the transfer of shares and cash to the participant performance units in general no taxable income is realized by a participant in the plan upon the grant of performance units at the time of payment such participant generally would include in ordinary income the dollar amount received with respect to the performance units and the fair market value of any shares of common stock delivered the company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction with respect to the amounts paid at the time that the participant recognizes ordinary income section m limit the plan is intended to enable the company to provide certain forms of performance based compensation to executive officers that will meet the requirements for tax deductibility under section m section m provides that subject to certain exceptions the company may not deduct compensation paid to any one of certain executive officers in excess of million in any one year section m excludes certain performance based compensation from the million limitation new plan benefits as described above the committee in its discretion will select the participants who receive awards and the size and types of those awards if the plan is approved by shareholders it is therefore not possible to predict the awards that will be made to particular individuals or groups under the plan stock options and performance shares awarded to the named executive officers in fiscal under the prior plan are set forth in the grants of plan based awards in fiscal table the value of stock options and restricted stock awarded to non employee directors under the prior plan is set forth in the director

the weighted average exercise price calculation in column b item fouradvisory vote on executive compensation section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act requires that we seek a non binding advisory vote from shareholders to approve the compensation as disclosed in the compensation discussion analysis cda tabular disclosures and related narrative of this proxy statement target s compensation programs are structured to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders they are designed to attract retain and motivate a premier management team to sustain our distinctive brand and competitive advantage in the marketplace and to provide a framework that delivers outstanding financial results over the long term our compensation programs for executive officers reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and incorporate performance based criteria more specifically we incorporate a mix of cash and equity compensation with varying time horizons and financial measures to reward sustained outstanding performance put an emphasis on variable compensation with financial performance measures that correlate with the creation of shareholder value and directly align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by linking long term compensation to stock price performance shareholders are urged to read the cda which discusses in depth how our compensation programs are aligned with our performance and the creation of shareholder value the compensation committee and the board of directors believe that the policies and practices described in the cda effectively implement our pay for performance compensation philosophy the board of directors upon recommendation of the compensation committee recommends that shareholders vote for approval of the following non binding resolution resolved that the shareholders approve the compensation awarded to the named executive officers as described in the cda tabular disclosures and other narrative executive compensation disclosures in this proxy statement effect of proposal the say on pay resolution is non binding the approval or disapproval of this proposal by shareholders will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding target s executive compensation practices the final decision on the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the compensation committee the board believes that the compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interest of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of target s shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions item fiveadvisory vote on the frequency of say on pay votes pursuant to section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act at least once every six years we are required to submit for a shareholder vote a non binding resolution to determine whether the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation shall occur every one two or three years after careful consideration of the various arguments supporting each frequency level the board believes that submitting the advisory vote on executive compensation to shareholders on an annual basis is appropriate for target and its shareholders at this time the board of directors recommends a vote for a frequency of year the proxy card provides shareholders with four choices every year years years or abstain shareholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the board s recommendation effect of proposal the say on pay frequency vote is non binding the outcome of this vote will not require the board or the compensation committee to take any action regarding the frequency of future say on pay votes however the board and the compensation committee will consider the outcome of this vote in its decision on how often to present the say on pay vote to shareholders item sixshareholder proposal on compensation benchmarking the afscme employees pension plan l street n w washington d c which held shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that the board of directors of target corporation target adopt a policy that benchmarks used to establish base salary and total direct compensation for the named executive officers be less than or equal to the thpercentile of peers supporting statement as commentators have struggled to understand the sharp increase in the pay of us executives one feature that has come under scrutiny is the use of peer groups and benchmarking former dupont ceo edward woolard jr has observed the main reason compensation increases every year is that most boards want their ceo to be in the top half of the ceo peer group because they think it makes the company look strong so when tom dick and harry receive compensation increases i get one too even if i had a bad year this leads to an upward spiral what s wrong with executive compensation harvard business review january we believe that this is the case even if compensation is set just slightly above the median but target s benchmarking goes beyond that according to target s proxy statement the company typically targets base salary and total direct compensation for all executive officers near the thpercentile of the retail peer group and thpercentile of the general industry peer group goals for total direct compensation are at the thpercentile of the retail peer group and at the thpercentile of the general industry peer group the difference between the median and thpercentile is substantial for fiscal the difference for the base salary between the median and the thpercentile was benchmarking at those levels is neither appropriate nor necessary and it contributes to an upward spiral of compensation that is not in the best interest of target shareholders by setting the salary above the median the company virtually guarantees that salary will go up significantly every year and in fact that this has happened every year since mr steinhafel became ceo by setting total direct compensation at the thpercentile target has in effect guaranteed a ratcheting up of pay at our company while also contributing to a cascading effect at other companies that use target for peer comparison raises in pay designed to exceed the median will increase the median even if only a small number of companies set such a high benchmark the median will increase every year promoting a spiraling increase in compensation for top executives the methodology suggests that salary will increase routinely without regard to individual or company performance shareholders call on the board to adopt a more appropriate benchmark for compensation we urge shareholders to vote for this proposal position of the board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders as explained in more detail in the cda of this proxy statement pages the board believes that the considerations used in determining total direct compensation including determinations to compensate at levels above the median of its peer groups is appropriate for the following reasons the size of target corporation in relation to the members of its peer groups the board s belief that the executive officer level positions within target are more expansive in scope than similar positions at peer companies specifically within the retail peer group the board s belief that the executive officer positions are more complex given the diversified nature of our business the higher percentage of total direct compensation that is at risk for target s executive officers compared to our retail and general industry peer groups the board s general philosophy to ensure that target is able to attract and retain the highest level of talent available in the marketplace target s record of performing better than the median of its retail peer group over various time horizons the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on compensation benchmarking item sevenshareholder proposal on electronics recycling as you sow on behalf of shareholder philip klasky who held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting resolution resolved that target corp s board of directors prepare a report at reasonable cost and excluding confidential information on policy options above and beyond legal compliance to minimize the environmental impacts of its electronics recycling activities by promoting reuse of working equipment and preventing export to non oecd countries of hazardous e waste and untested or non working equipment or components supporting statement whereas target corp is the fourth largest u s retailer of consumer electronics which contain many toxic materials such as lead mercury cadmium brominated flame retardants polyvinyl chloride and are difficult to recycle the u s environmental protection agency estimates that only percent of electronic waste disposed of in the u s was removed for recycling in e waste is the fastest growing part of the municipal waste stream comprising more than although the most hazardous component of the municipal waste stream the estimated recovery rate for e waste is far below the overall u s recovery rate for municipal waste of improper disposal of electronics can result in serious public health and environmental impacts old analog tv sets and monitors with cathode ray tubes contain large amounts of lead flat screen monitors contain mercury switches and computer batteries contain cadmium all of which can be harmful to human health if released to the environment electronic goods collected for recycling in the us are often shipped by recyclers to developing countries where they endanger health and the environment for instance exporting harm the high tech trashing of asia a report by basel action network ban revealed appalling conditions in the city of guiyu china where approximately migrant workers break apart and process old electronic equipment including cell phones computers printers and monitors under primitive conditions workers openly burn plastics and wires and melt toxic soldered circuit boards to extract gold silver and copper these activities threaten worker health and pollute land and water tons of discarded components lie strewn about the countryside ban exposed similarly disturbing conditions in lagos nigeria target s corporate responsibility report states we take responsibility for our social environmental and economic impact yet the company lacks a policy to ensure safe disposal of the electronics it collects our company provides take back for small devices such as music players and mobile phones the company does not disclose substantive information about the disposition of electronics it collects whether it promotes reuse of working equipment and whether it bars export of collected electronics to the harmful circumstances described by ban in our view shareholders need assurances that take back programs are monitoring how collected goods are reused or recycled the proponents believe all electronics collected by our company should be recycled and or refurbished by globally responsible electronics recyclers who are independently verified to meet a minimum standard such as the e stewards standard best buy for example bars downstream service providers from exporting non working equipment or components to developing countries and requires third party audits of providers position of board of directors the board of directors has considered this proposal and believes that its adoption at this time is not in the best interests of target or our shareholders target maintains an active program to monitor its recycling and disposal practices for electronic waste these practices include ensuring that all items are marketed for re use refurbished or broken down and recycled all e waste items are processed domestically and no e waste materials are sent to landfills anywhere in the world monthly reporting by vendors on all sales and recycling activity which along with site audits allows for transparency and visibility into vendor processes target s program includes consideration of whether vendors have met various certification standards such as the e stewards standard mentioned in the proposal the vendors internal processes and reputation and periodic process reviews and inspections by appropriate target team members or third party inspectors the vendor responsible for the majority of target s e waste is in the final stages of obtaining e steward certification and expects completion in target does not believe a special report to shareholders on this topic is necessary but will consider addressing this topic in more detail in our corporate responsibility report the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal on electronics recycling additional information business

be received per share by the shareholders of the company upon the occurrence of the fundamental change nothing in this section c shall limit the provisions of section b d reduction in awards when applicable anything in this plan to the contrary notwithstanding the provisions of this section d shall apply to a participant if an independent auditor selected by the committee the auditor determines that each of x and y below are applicable x payments or distributions hereunder determined without application of this section d either alone or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to the participant which are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the company or otherwise but after any elimination or reduction of such payments under the terms of the company s officer income continuance policy statement as amended would result in any portion of the payments hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under section of the code y the excise tax imposed on the participant under section of the code on excess parachute payments from whatever source would result in a lesser net aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the participant after subtraction of the excise tax than if payments and distributions to the participant were reduced to the maximum amount that could be made without incurring the excise tax reduced amount under this section d the payments and distributions under this plan shall be reduced but not below zero so that the present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the reduced amount the reduced amount which may be zero shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of payments and distributions under this plan which can be made without causing any such payment to be subject to the excise tax under section of the code the determinations and reductions under this section d shall be made after eliminations or reductions if any have been made under the company s officer income continuance policy statement as amended procedure if the auditor determines that this section d is applicable to a participant it shall so advise the committee in writing the committee shall then promptly give the participant notice to that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such determination which shall include a statement of the reduced amount such notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the awards shall be eliminated or reduced as long as their aggregate present value equals the reduced amount for purposes of this section d awards shall be reduced in the following order options with an exercise price above the then fair market value of a share of common stock that have a positive value for purposes of section g of the code as determined under applicable irs guidance pro rata among awards that constitute deferred compensation subject to code section a and if a further reduction is necessary to reach the reduced amount among the awards that are not subject to code section a present value shall be determined in accordance with code section g all the a foregoing determinations made by the auditor under this section d shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that excess parachute payments as defined in section g of the code will be made to the participant if an elimination or reduction is not made as promptly as practicable the company shall provide to or for the benefit of the participant such amounts and shares as are then due to the participant under this plan and shall promptly provide to or for the benefit of the participant in the future such amounts and shares as become due to the participant under this plan corrections as a result of the uncertainty in the application of section g of the code at the time of the initial determination by the auditor hereunder it is possible that payments or distributions under this plan will have been made which should not have been made overpayment or that additional payments or distributions which will have not been made could have been made underpayment in each case consistent with the calculation of the reduced amount hereunder in the event that the auditor based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the internal revenue service against the company or the participant which the auditor believes has a high probability of success determines that an overpayment has been made any such overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the participant which the participant shall repay together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f of the code provided however that no amount shall be payable by the participant if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to the excise tax under section of the code in the event that the auditor based upon controlling precedent determines that an underpayment has occurred any such underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of the participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f a of the code non cash benefits in making its determination under this section d the value of any non cash benefit shall be determined by the auditor in accordance with the principles of section g d of the code determinations binding all determinations made by the auditor under this section d

will be made under the plan to that service provider or to eligible service providers generally nothing in the plan or in any agreement or related documents shall confer upon any service provider or
