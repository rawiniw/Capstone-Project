for doubtful accounts is recognized in an amount equal to the anticipated future write offs of existing receivables and includes provisions for uncollectible finance charges and other credit related

doubtful accounts three months ended nine months ended millions october october october october allowance at beginning of period bad debt expense write offs a recoveries a allowance at end of period a write offs include the principal amount of losses excluding accrued and unpaid finance charges and recoveries include current period principal collections on previously written off balances these amounts combined represent net write offs deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions in the united states would adversely affect the risk profile of our credit card receivables portfolio based on credit card holders ability to pay their balances if such deterioration were to occur it would lead to an increase in bad debt expense the corporation monitors both the credit quality and the delinquency status of the credit card receivables portfolio we consider accounts or more days past due as delinquent and we update delinquency status daily we also monitor risk in the portfolio by assigning internally generated scores to each account and by periodically obtaining a statistically representative sample of current fico scores a nationally recognized credit scoring model we update these fico scores monthly the credit quality segmentation presented below is consistent with the approach used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivables credit quality october

accounts accounts that complete their assigned payment plan are removed from the tdr population payments received on troubled debt restructurings are first applied to finance charges and fees then to the unpaid principal balance funding for credit card receivables as a method of providing funding for our credit card receivables we sell on an ongoing basis all of our consumer credit card receivables to target receivables llc tr llc formerly known as target receivables corporation trc a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary tr llc then transfers the receivables to the target credit card master trust the trust which from time to time will sell debt securities to third parties either directly or through a related trust these debt securities represent undivided interests in the

the receivables within the trust and any debt securities issued by the trust or a related trust in our consolidated statements of financial position based upon the applicable accounting guidance the receivables transferred to the trust are not available to general creditors of the corporation during and we sold an interest in our credit card receivables by issuing a variable funding certificate parties who hold the variable funding certificate receive interest at a variable short term market rate the variable funding certificate matures in and in the second quarter of we sold an interest in our credit card receivables to jpmorgan chase jpmc the interest sold represented percent of the receivables portfolio at the time of the transaction in the event of a decrease in the receivables principal amount such that jpmcs interest in the entire portfolio would exceed percent for three consecutive months tr llc using the cash flows from the assets in the trust would be required to pay jpmc a pro rata amount of principal collections such that the portion owned by jpmc would not exceed percent unless jpmc provides a waiver conversely at the option of the corporation jpmc may be required to fund an increase in the portfolio to maintain their percent interest up to a maximum principal balance of billion due to declines in gross credit card receivables tr llc repaid jpmc million and million during the first nine months of and respectively if a three month average of monthly finance charge excess jpmcs pro rata share of finance charge collections less write offs and

finance charge excess falls below percent of the outstanding principal balance of jpmcs interest jpmc may compel the corporation to implement underwriting and collections activities provided those activities are compatible with the corporations systems as well as consistent with similar credit card receivable portfolios managed by jpmc if the corporation fails to implement the activities jpmc has the right to cause the accelerated repayment of the note payable issued in the transaction as noted in the preceding paragraph payments would be made solely from the trust assets we have the right to prepay the principal balance on the note payable to jpmc through january if we elect to prepay the outstanding balance we will be required to pay a make whole premium ranging from million to

provided the cash flows from the trust assets are sufficient and are nonrecourse to the general assets of the corporation if the cash flows are less than the periodic interest the available amount if

total credit card receivables portfolio less theinterest expense on nonrecourse debtcollateralized by credit card receivables we analyze this measure of profit in light of the amount of capital we have invested in our credit card receivables in addition we measure the performance of our overall credit card receivables portfolio by calculating the dollar spread to libor at the portfolio level

financing cost applied to the entire portfolio the interest rate on all nonrecourse debt securitized by credit card receivables is tied to libor u s credit card segment profit for the three and nine

revenue segment expenses were million and million for the three and nine months ended october a decrease of million and million or percent and percent respectively from the comparable prior year

totaled million and million respectively and primarily consisted of compensation benefits and consulting expenses these expenses are reported in sga expense within the consolidated statement of

compared with million for the same period in during target issued billion of unsecured debt that matures in july and issued commercial paper of which million was outstanding as of october this cash

our period end gross credit card receivables were million at october compared with million at october a decrease of percent average gross credit card receivables during the nine months ended october decreased percent compared with the nine months ended october this change was driven by the factors indicated in the u s credit card segment above due to declines in gross credit card receivables tr

million per share and million per share respectively under a billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in november during the three and nine months ended october we repurchased million and million shares respectively of our common stock for million per share and million per share respectively we paid dividends totaling million and million for the three and nine months ended october and million and million during the three and nine months ended october an increase of percent and percent respectively we declared dividends totaling million per share in third quarter an increase of percent over the million per share of declared dividends during the third quarter of we have paid dividends every quarter since our first dividend was declared following our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt commercial paper and securitized debt markets has provided ample sources of liquidity to target our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings the ratings assigned to our debt by the credit rating agencies affect both the pricing and terms of any new financing as of october our credit ratings were as follows credit ratings moodys standard and poors fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper p a f securitized receivables a aa n a n a a these rated securitized receivables exclude the interest in our credit card receivables sold to jpmc if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same as described above as a measure of our financial condition we monitor our interest coverage ratio representing the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges to fixed charges fixed charges include interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense our interest coverage ratio was x for the first nine months of and x for the first nine months of we have liquidity available to us through a committed billion unsecured revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in october which will expire in october this new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a previously held billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in april no balances were outstanding at any time during the first three quarters of or under either facility most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at october no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non investment grade we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations and to finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives throughout we also continue to anticipate ample access to long term financing further in january we announced our plan to actively pursue the sale of our credit card receivables portfolio which may provide additional funding as of october the gross balance of our credit card receivables portfolio was million of which million was funded by third parties and million was funded by target we completed our real estate transaction with zellers and became the lessee for sites of which we expect to open to target locations in turn zellers has agreed to leaseback selected sites where the monthly lease payments on these leases and zellers subleases are equal at our option zellers is required to vacate the properties between january and march generally following a month notice period this transaction resulted in a final net purchase price of million we plan to invest between billion to billion in canada over the next three years to renovate acquired sites that we intend to convert into target stores establish supply chain capabilities build information technology infrastructure and acquire and develop other sites unrelated to the zellers transaction the amount we ultimately invest will be largely dependent on the number of target stores we elect to operate in canada during the nine months ended october the value of ranged from c to c and averaged c on october was equivalent to c contractual obligations and commitments a summary of future obligations under our various contractual obligations and commitments as of january was disclosed in our k as a result of our acquisition of leasehold interests in sites from zellers we have additional future minimum capital lease payments of billion during the three months ended october there were no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business however we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations including internal development of new products programs and technology applications and acquisitions new accounting pronouncements in may the fasb issued accounting standards update fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in u s gaap and ifrs which amends the current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position in june the fasb issued accounting standards update comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income which revises the current practice of including other comprehensive income within the equity section of the statement of financial position and requires disclosure of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in a separate statement this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption to have an impact on our consolidated net earnings cash flows or financial position but the adoption will change the current presentation of other comprehensive income in our financial statements outlook we expect to achieve consolidated diluted earnings per share eps of to in the fourth quarter this earnings outlook does not include any reduction in tax expense from the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters currently estimated at approximately million or any impact of a potential credit card asset sale and potential early extinguishment of non recourse debt collateralized by credit card receivables in the u s retail segment we generally expect recent trends and performance drivers to continue in the fourth quarter we expect a fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of percent or slightly less we expect the fourth quarter retail ebit margin rate to be similar to last years fourth quarter reflecting continued gross margin rate pressure offset by rate favorability on the sga and depreciation and amortization expense lines in our u s credit card segment we expect continued strong performance in the fourth quarter however as we begin to compare against prior year periods in which our results benefited from credit card receivable allowance reductions we are unlikely to continue to report increases in segment profit we expect our direct costs segment ebit interest expense on capital leases and related tax effects associated with entry into canada will result in a to unfavorable impact on fourth quarter eps we expect capital expenditures related to our u s retail operations to be in the range of billion to billion driven primarily by our store remodel program we expect to continue to execute against our share repurchase plan and may repurchase up to million during the fourth quarter of the timing and amount of share repurchase activity if any will be dependent on market conditions the amount of future net earnings and cash flows forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements which are based on our current assumptions and expectations these statements are typically accompanied by the words expect may could believe would might anticipates or words of similar import the principal forward looking statements in this report include for our u s retail segment our outlook for sales comparable store

conjunction with the forward looking statements in this report forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement in addition to the gaap results provided in this release the company provides non gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share non gaap adjusted eps for the three and nine months ended october and october this measure is not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share management believes non gaap adjusted eps is useful in providing period to period comparisons of the results of our u s operations non gaap adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of the companys results as reported under gaap other companies may calculate non gaap adjusted eps differently than the company does limiting the usefulness of the measure
