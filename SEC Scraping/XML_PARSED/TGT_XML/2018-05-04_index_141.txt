statement back to contents risk oversight a summary of the allocation of general risk oversight functions among management the board and its committees is as follows the primary responsibility for the identification assessment and management of the various risks that we face belongs with management at the management level risks are prioritized and assigned to senior leaders based on the risks relationship to the leaders business area and focus those senior leaders develop plans to address the risks and measure the progress of risk management efforts our chief legal risk officer provides

risk management program the risk compliance committee coordinates the oversight of different risks by the board and each committee and is structured to support that coordination by having at least one director from each committee included in its membership the boards oversight of the risks occurs as an integral and continuous part of the boards oversight of our business and seeks to ensure that management has in place processes to deal appropriately with risk for example our principal strategic risks are reviewed as part of the boards regular discussion and consideration of our strategy and the alignment of specific initiatives with that strategy similarly at every meeting the board reviews the principal factors influencing our operating results including the competitive environment and

development and execution of our capital allocation policy are primarily the responsibility of our management and are overseen by the board and its committees our management follows a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities ranked in order of importance priorities description investing in our business fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business create sustainable long term value and maintain our current operations and assets annual dividend maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually share repurchase return excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals dividend and share repurchase philosophy our business generates more cash than we currently need to fully invest in the growth and long term health of our business so we return excess cash to shareholders through an appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase we believe that both dividends and share repurchases serve important purposes we believe that our dividend should be competitive reliable and sustainable we also believe that share repurchase is the most effective way to return any excess cash to shareholders after we have met our other priorities of fully investing in our business and maintaining a competitive dividend because it allows shareholders to redeploy the cash as they choose while providing us with appropriate flexibility to respond to changes in our operating performance and investment opportunities for example we suspended all share repurchase activity for a period from the middle of through early in response to changes in our operating performance but we continued to invest in our business and grew our annual dividend during that period capital allocation oversight the board of directors and its committees share responsibility for overseeing capital allocation among our three capital allocation priorities responsible

table of contents executive summary our performance framework for executive compensation other benefit elements compensation governance target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents executive summary to provide context for the compensation decisions made in it is important to recognize that we and the retail industry in general were experiencing deteriorating traffic and sales in particularly in the fourth quarter this performance reflected a rapid change in consumer behavior including soft spending in many of the categories we sell combined with a rapid shift in consumer preferences toward online retail in light of those challenges several of our competitors were announcing store closures and scaling back their operations to protect profitability in contrast in late february we announced a multi year plan in which we would aggressively invest in our business in support of our goal to position target for sustained profitable market share gains over the long term these investments included capital expenditures of more than billion in and more than billion over a three year period to remodel more than stores open small format stores enhance targets digital capabilities and modernize our supply chain and direct spending investments that would lower operating margin by billion in specifically in hours and wages in our stores lower prices to reinforce targets value perception and accelerated depreciation driven by the advancement of our store remodel program much of our compensation program consists of long term incentives that measure our performance relative to our competitors given our decision to aggressively invest in our long term growth during a period of significant industry stress the independent members of the full board considered the near term headwinds that our investments would present when approving our fiscal short term incentive goals in march and the price vested stock options price vested options in april see page for more information respectively the pace of our investments either met or exceeded the goals we announced at the beginning of the year guests responded faster than expected to our investments which contributed to financial performance that exceeded expectations comparable sales in increased compared with an expectation for a low single digit decrease going into the year comparable sales grew in the fourth quarter bringing fiscal total adjusted sales to the highest level in our history both traffic and comparable sales trends improved throughout we saw acceleration across the business as we gained market share across our five core merchandise categories given stronger than expected sales our business generated better than expected profitability which partially offset the near term headwinds created by the investments in our business the independent members of the human resources compensation committee considered financial and strategic achievements against business goals and plans as well as the challenging competitive retail landscape in determining short term incentive payouts for fiscal see page for more information shareholder support for our advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder outreach program at our june annual meeting of shareholders shareholders approved our say on pay proposal in support of our executive compensation program by consistent with the fiscal vote of and fiscal vote of we believe open dialogue with our shareholders and incorporation of their feedback into our executive compensation program has been instrumental in obtaining shareholder support for our compensation programs design and direction we regularly engage in outreach efforts with our shareholders relating to a variety of topics and involve one or more independent directors in these conversations as appropriate we use the information gathered through these outreach efforts to help inform our compensation decisions we look forward to continued dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business summary of key compensation decisions for fiscal topic description more information total compensation decisions timing shift during fiscal the board approved a shift in the timing of the total compensation decisions for executive officers and the board of directors from the last month of fiscal to march this transition allows for consideration of full year financial results prior to annual grant and pay level decisions and aligns timing of executive officers and the board of directors with the broader target team this transition also impacts the summary compensation table as described on page price vested options as described in last years cda price vested options were approved in april to serve as an incentive to successfully execute our turnaround efforts and as a supplemental compensation element based exclusively on stock price performance to align with shareholder value human resources compensation committee use of negative discretion the human resources compensation committee applied negative discretion to reduce the payout for the financial component of our short term incentive plan stip as follows the ceo payout was reduced by percentage points of base salary the other neo payout was reduced by percentage points of base salary target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents pay for performance we have a long standing belief that our executive compensation should be directly linked to performance and the creation of long term value for our shareholders we do that by providing our neos a mix of base salary short term and long term incentives with compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our near term and long term strategic goals the human resources compensation committee uses the at goal amounts of those key elements to determine the annual at goal total direct compensation annual tdc of our neos which is a useful measure of pay because it reflects the intended aggregate value of those key elements of pay at the time the pay decision is made the calculation of our annual tdc is described on page for our neos our short term incentives are based on annual absolute financial goals and progress made toward key strategic priorities our fiscal goals were approved at the beginning of the year taking into consideration our business strategies and the challenges facing the retail industry our financial performance exceeded our strategic plans despite expected headwinds presented by our substantial investment in our strategic initiatives resulting in payouts well above goal for further discussion of our fiscal goals and performance refer to pages of our long term incentive lti program features performance based metrics and is tied to relative performance versus our retail peers over a three year time period our pay for performance philosphy is evidenced by our payouts over the past five years for our stip and psu awards which are shown in the charts below as a percentage of goal our ceo did not receive a stip payout three out of the last five years in addition our neos did not receive a psu payout three out of the last five years stip and psu awards make up more than of annual tdc for our ceo and more than of annual tdc for our other neos as disclosed in prior proxy statements psus spanning the and performance periods and stip payouts were forfeited for active executive officers including current neos mr cornell and mr mulligan when we did not meet the minimum performance condition under m for fiscal due to the discontinuation of canadian operations if the awards were not forfeited due to the minimum performance condition the financial results versus our peers would have yielded payouts below goal target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents performance highlights the following highlights show our historical performance on key metrics we use in our executive compensation programs over each of the last four years which includes the base year and the three years of the performance period for our long term incentive program our performance on these metrics drives our compensation outcomes and provides context to our decisions in setting our goal levels under those metrics these metrics including the goal levels and actual results for fiscal are described in more detail in the narratives for each compensation element total adjusted sales which is one of the metrics used in our stip and our psus is calculated by excluding pharmacy and clinic sales of million and million from fiscal and gaap consolidated sales respectively this adjustment is made for comparison purposes due to the sale of the pharmacy and clinic business to cvs at the end of fiscal total adjusted sales does not include any adjustments to fiscal and gaap consolidated sales additionally for our psu compensation element we use total adjusted sales except that because was a week accounting year we adjusted it to reflect a week accounting year to ensure consistent comparison with the fiscal base year which lowered the amount by

performance goals and how we performed in comparison to these goals our incentive ebit and total adjusted sales goal amounts were approved by the independent members of the full board at the beginning of the year taking into account our business strategies and the challenges facing the retail industry for context our fiscal goals were established shortly after our decision to make substantial investments in our long term growth which were communicated to our investors in conjunction with the release of our financial guidance for fiscal these investments included capital expenditures of more than billion in and more than billion over a three year period to remodel more than stores open small format stores enhance targets digital capabilities and modernize our supply chain and direct spending investments that would lower operating margin by billion in specifically in hours and wages in our stores lower prices to reinforce targets value perception and accelerated depreciation driven by the acceleration of our store remodel program at the time the goals were set these investments were expected to present headwinds to both our incentive ebit and total adjusted sales performance in comparison to prior periods the intent in setting the fiscal stip goals was that performance in line with our strategic plan and external financial guidance would result in payouts around goal in order to achieve the maximum payout our performance would have to exceed our strategic plans to a significant degree historically our stip goals have proven rigorous with financial component payouts only two of the last five years target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents metric goal actual incentive ebit total adjusted sales in millions actual amounts represent a week accounting year our actual incentive ebit and total adjusted sales results exceeded our financial plans despite the expected headwinds presented by the substantial investments in our strategic initiatives specifically comparable sales in increased compared with an expectation for a low single digit decrease going into the year comparable sales grew in the fourth quarter bringing fiscal total adjusted sales to the highest level in our history both traffic and comparable sales trends improved throughout we saw acceleration across the business as we gained market share across our five core merchandise categories given stronger than expected sales our business generated better than expected profitability which partially offset the near term headwinds created by the investments in our business use of negative discretion despite strong financial performance that exceeded the maximum goals of the financial component of the stip the human resources compensation committee recognized that we are still in the early stages of a multi year transformative strategy and a maximum payout felt premature as such the human resources compensation committee applied negative discretion to reduce the payout as follows the ceo payout was reduced by percentage points of base salary the other neo payout was reduced by percentage points of base salary fiscal team scorecard assessment the team scorecard portion of the stip for our non ceo neos in was focused on the goal to test build and scale foundational capabilities as a next generation retailer grow market share by reinvigorating our assortment and reimagine and reposition our assets to deliver even greater competitive advantage the team scorecard provides a general structure for discussing and measuring performance of the management team as a group excluding our ceo throughout the year our ceo provided the human resources compensation committee interim assessments of team scorecard performance for fiscal primary team scorecard progress indicators identified at the beginning of the year included digital channel sales growth that outpaces the industry owned brand launches and redesigned store experiences supply chain optimization new small format stores and a significant number of store remodels our management team drove meaningful progress against these key indicators achieved digital channel sales growth of which significantly outpaced the industry average launched new brands in apparel and home supported by apparel and home redesigned store experiences reached supply chain optimization goals by reducing cycle time significantly with greater than of orders fulfilled from a store added new small format stores which have a much higher per foot sales

with long term performance of our annual lti grants feature relative performance based metrics and comprises the majority of each neos total compensation value of lti awarded at grant and grant timing shift in determining the amount of individual lti awards the human resources compensation committee considered each neos individual contributions to business outcomes during the fiscal year potential future contributions historical annual grant amounts and retention considerations as well as market data for comparable executives from our retail and general industry peer groups during fiscal we shifted the timing of total compensation decisions for executive officers which shifted the timing of our annual equity grants to march of each year instead of our previous practice of granting equity to executive officers in january which is the last month of our fiscal year this grant timing shift was made to align the grant timing of executive officers with the grant timing for all other team members who receive equity grants and to ensure that the full year financial results for the most recently completed fiscal year may be considered prior to making the grants due to this grant timing shift the equity grant that would have traditionally been made in january during fiscal was instead made in march during fiscal as a result the executive officers compensation as reported in the summary compensation table for fiscal was significantly lower than prior years because it did not include any annual equity grants the only grants included in the summary compensation table for this year were the price vested options for more detail see page if the executive officers annual tdc for fiscal had included the annual equity grant made in march it would have been as follows annual tdc for neos cornell mulligan smith mcnamara potts base salary at goal stip fiscal components of annual tdc lti component of annual tdc march grant total annual tdc annual tdc differs from the total in the summary compensation table on page because it a includes stip opportunity at goal rather than actual payout and the aggregate grant date fair value of pbrsus and psus granted in march and b excludes the value of the price vested options and the items shown under the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings and all other compensation columns the march pbrsu and psu awards are used in annual tdc this year because there were no annual lti awards granted in fiscal due to the grant timing shift described above the human resources compensation committee views annual tdc as a useful measure of pay because it reflects the intended aggregate value of key elements of pay at the time the pay decision is made the human resources compensation committee made no changes to the neos annual lti grants versus the prior year target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents psus our psus have a three year performance period and are settled in stock the plan payout is intended to reflect the same key metrics we use to manage our business and drive shareholder returns over time each metric is compared relative to our retail peer group and is intended to incent management to outperform the peer group over the long term the three relative metrics used in our psu plan are change in market share a companys change in market share is calculated by determining the difference between b and a each as defined below and dividing that difference by a as defined below the market is the sum of domestic net sales for us and our retail peer group a the companys domestic net sales in the baseline year is divided by the markets domestic net sales for the baseline year b the companys domestic net sales in the final year of the performance period is divided by the markets domestic net sales for the final year eps growth the compound annual growth rate of our eps from continuing operations versus the reported eps from continuing operations of our retail peer group after tax roic three year average net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital for both our results and our retail peer group excluding discontinued operations with these three independent metrics our psu program supports the critical drivers of our success to grow the top line relative to the retail sector to grow it profitably and to ensure prudent deployment of capital to drive the business the following example illustrates psu payouts at various levels of performance for more information about our peer groups see pages target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents psu adjustments the intent of our psu program is to measure performance relative to our peer group on the previously described metrics to achieve this measurement objectively we base the initial rankings on annual reported financial results of each member of the retail peer group and target unless determined otherwise at the time of grant the human resources compensation committee has reserved discretion to adjust the reported financial results for target or any member of the retail peer group if it believes such adjustments necessary to properly gauge targets relative performance adjustments to target and peer results if any are disclosed in the proxy in the year of payout historically adjustments to targets results have included items that did not reflect our core operations and typically decreased participants resulting payouts consistent with past practice the human resources compensation committee approved adjustments to the psu payout to exclude the following the rd week from our fiscal sales and those of our peers to ensure a consistent time frame comparison with fiscal base year sales the impact of the one time gain in due to the cvs health transaction from roic to prevent targets operational performance from being overstated due to the transaction and targets pharmacy and clinic business from fiscal base

business lines we sold other than as described above no adjustments were made to our annual reported results or those of our peers in determining the psu payout psu payout in april the neos received

corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents price vested options as disclosed in last years proxy statement in april the board approved price vested options to help maintain continuity of the executive team throughout this investment period galvanize them around the key initiatives and reward success in this transformational effort the price vested options serve as a supplemental compensation element based exclusively on stock price performance to complement outstanding lti awards through the investment period announced in february the price vested options exercise price is equal to the fair market value on may the grant date the key design features of the price vested options align managements interests with shareholders vesting is based on both time and stock price criteria the price vested options are not exercisable during the first three years and will become exercisable only if targets stock price exceeds a hurdle of per share for consecutive trading days within the seven year term of the options the stock price criteria are challenging the performance hurdle of per share maintained for a period of consecutive days is challenging both in terms of historic stock price levels and in relation to our share price on the dates of approval and grant the price hurdle was well above our average price for the period between the february announcement and april approval date which was the price hurdle also represents a premium over our closing price of on may the grant date the consecutive day requirement helps to mitigate temporary stock price fluctuations from influencing potential gains as of the date of this proxy statement the stock price criteria have not yet been achieved mandatory post exercise holding period the shares received upon exercise net of exercise costs and taxes are subject to a one year post exercise holding period even if this period extends beyond termination of employment during the post exercise holding period the shares received upon exercise may not be used by the executive in satisfying our stock ownership guidelines strict forfeiture provisions for voluntary terminations price vested options are completely forfeited if the executive leaves within the first three years of the grant date no retirement based extensions notably and in contrast to the terms of our annual lti awards there are no retirement based extensions of vesting or exercisability for these price vested options relationship to other compensation elements of our annual lti grant features performance based metrics that measure our performance relative to our peers the committee believes the price vested options provide a market based complement to the relative performance measures of the other outstanding compensation elements through the investment period announced in february we proactively disclosed detailed information about these awards in last years cda however the grant date fair values appear in the compensation tables of this proxy statement since they were granted in fiscal therefore the grant date fair values of the price vested options are included in the option awards column of the summary compensation table on page mr cornell and each of the other neos received price vested options with grant date fair values of million and million respectively other benefit elements we offer other benefit components designed to encourage retention of key talent including pension plan no pension plan is available to any employee hired after january we maintain a pension

corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents compensation governance process for determining executive compensation including neos human resources compensation committee the human resources compensation committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of the pay packages for all of our executive officers including the ceo the human resources compensation committee receives assistance from two sources a an independent compensation consulting firm semler brossy consulting group sbcg and b our internal executive compensation staff led by our executive vice president chief human resources officer all decisions regarding executive compensation are made solely by the human resources compensation committee the human resources compensation committee may not delegate its primary responsibility of overseeing executive officer compensation but it may delegate to management the administrative aspects of our compensation plans that do not involve the setting of compensation levels for executive officers in addition the human resources compensation committee has established an equity subcommittee comprised of ms austin mr darden and ms healey for the purposes of granting equity awards to members of the board of directors and any officers who are subject to section of the exchange act and to take any action required to be performed by a committee or subcommittee of non employee directors to preserve the exemption available under rule b of the exchange act human resources compensation committees independent consultant sbcg has been retained by and reports directly to the human resources compensation committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or target the committee assessed sbcgs independence in light of the sec and nyse listing standards and determined that no conflict of interest or independence concerns exist with respect to ceo compensation sbcg provides an independent recommendation to the human resources compensation committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes for the human resources compensation committees consideration in developing its recommendation sbcg relies on its understanding of targets business and compensation programs and sbcgs independent research and analysis sbcg does not meet with our ceo with respect to ceo compensation sbcg also provides an independent assessment of the ceos recommendations on neo compensation to the human resources compensation committee compensation of other executive officers and role of management in developing

provided by managements external compensation consultants willis towers watson and korn ferry hay group covering our retail and general industry peer group companies managements outside consultants do not have any interaction with either the human resources compensation committee or our ceo but do interact with the executive vice president chief human resources officer and her staff in addition to providing market data managements external compensation consultants perform other services for target unrelated to the determination of executive compensation our executive vice president chief human resources officer and the ceo work together to develop our ceos compensation recommendations to the human resources compensation committee for other executive officers the ceo alone is responsible for providing final compensation recommendations for the other executive officers to the human resources compensation committee benchmarking using compensation peer groups peer group market positioning is another important factor considered in determining each executive officers annual tdc the annual tdc levels and elements described in the preceding pages are evaluated annually for each executive officer relative to our retail and general industry peer group companies the market comparisons are determined by use of compensation data obtained from publicly available proxy statements analyzed by sbcg and proprietary survey data assembled by willis towers watson and korn ferry hay group due to a range of factors including the scope of neo positions tenure in role and company specific concerns there is an imperfect comparability of neo positions between companies as such market position served as a reference point in the annual tdc determination process rather than a formula driven outcome the retail peer group was formulated based on an initial screen of companies in the global industry classification standard retailing index with revenue from core retail operations greater than billion the retail peer group is also used within our lti plans targets relative performance compared to this peer group on key metrics determines overall payout for our psu and pbrsu awards general industry companies are also included as a peer group because they represent companies with whom we compete for talent like the selected retailers the general industry companies are large and among the leaders in their industries target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents the composition of the peer groups is reviewed annually to ensure it is appropriate in terms of

programs and policies exacerbate top enterprise wide risks next we take a bottom up approach to assess the following key compensation risk areas performance measures pay mix goal setting and performance curve leverage magnitude of pay calculation of performance participant communication severance and corporate governance the results of this analysis which concluded that our policies and

company performance performance goals goals are approved by our independent directors and take into account our historical performance current strategic initiatives and the expected macroeconomic environment in addition short term and long term incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves and leverage that support our pay for performance philosophy equity incentives equity incentive programs and stock ownership guidelines are designed to align management and shareholder interests by providing vehicles for executive officers to accumulate and maintain an ownership position in the company risk mitigation policies we incorporate several risk mitigation policies into our officer compensation program including the human resources compensation committees ability to use negative discretion to determine appropriate payouts under formula based plans a clawback policy to recover incentive compensation that was based on inaccurate financial statements stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors and anti hedging and anti pledging policies clawback policy our clawback policy which covers all senior executives was expanded in early to cover material financial or material reputational harm previously the policy was only triggered if there was intentional misconduct that resulted in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements the expanded policy allows for recovery of compensation if a senior executives intentional misconduct violates the law our code of conduct or any significant ethics or compliance policy and results in material financial harm or material reputational harm or results in a need for a restatement of our consolidated financial statements the compensation elements that are subject to recovery under this policy include all amounts paid under the stip including any discretionary payments all awards under the long term incentive plan whether exercised vested unvested or deferred and all amounts paid under the icp all recoveries are determined in the discretion of the human resources compensation committee anti hedging and anti pledging policy executive officers and members of the board of

under section m of the internal revenue code irc the performance based compensation exception under irc section m will apply to a significantly less portion of the compensation paid in fiscal and later years because of the changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act of our focus on pay for performance goes well beyond the steps we took to comply with irc section m and we will maintain that focus

receives a allowance for outplacement services the accelerated vesting provisions of pbrsu awards are described in the notes under the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year end table death if a neo dies while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and life insurance proceeds equal to three times the sum of the prior years annual base salary plus the most recent bonus and non equity incentive plan payments up to a maximum of million in addition the neos beneficiary will have the right to receive a payout if any under psus after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period disability if a neo becomes totally and permanently disabled while employed the post termination benefits generally consist of vesting of pbrsus with payout occurring after the end of the performance period based on the actual performance at the end of that period and monthly payments under the excess long term disability plan if he or she also participated in the widely available qualified long term disability plan our excess long term disability plan a self insured unfunded plan provides monthly disability income payments with respect to the portion of annualized salary and three year average

the neos employment terminating involuntarily without cause or voluntarily with good reason a material reduction in compensation or responsibilities or a required relocation following a change in control in general terms we will experience a change in control as defined in our compensation plans whenever any of the following events occur or more of our board of directors consists of persons who were not initially nominated or appointed by incumbent directors for which purpose any director who assumes office as a result of an actual or threatened contested election will not be considered as having been nominated or appointed by incumbent directors any person or group acquires or more of our common stock we merge with or into another company and our shareholders own less than of the combined company or our shareholders approve an agreement or plan to liquidate or dissolve our company our plans do not provide for any gross ups for taxes due on any payments described in this section target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents without termination of employment the consequence of a change in control to the neos without termination of employment is generally as follows the deferred compensation balance in the edcp will be paid in a lump sum as soon as allowed under irc section a unless the board of directors determines not to accelerate payment of these amounts and a double trigger applies to pbrsus or psu awards meaning that no vesting will accelerate upon a change in control unless an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason occurs with involuntary or good reason termination of employment in addition to the payments upon a change in control explained under without termination of employment if a neos employment terminates involuntarily without cause or voluntarily with good reason a material reduction in compensation or responsibilities or a required relocation following a change in control following a change in control the double trigger requirement will be met and the post termination benefits that may be received generally consistof severance payments under our icp accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options accelerated vesting of price vested options but only if the change in control occurs during the first three years of the term of the price vested options and the price hurdle has been met for outstanding pbrsus and psus the greater of a the amount the recipient would have been entitled to had the termination occurred without a change in control which ranges from to depending on the award type and the participants age and years of service or b a pro rata portion of the at goal payout based on the percentage of the three year vesting or performance period that has elapsed as of the date of the termination following the change in control the balance of the awards is forfeited we use the greater of calculation for pbrsus and psus to prevent a neo from receiving less due to a change in control than they would have received as a result of a similar termination absent a change in control in addition we use the at goal payout for calculating the pro rata portion rather than actual performance to eliminate arbitrary results that could occur with a shortened performance period and in case calculation of actual or comparable performance metrics would be unfeasible following the change in control pay ratio disclosure as disclosed in the summary compensation table on page the fiscal total annual compensation for our ceo was which is significantly lower than in fiscal due to a shift in the timing of annual equity grants described in the cda on page we estimate that the fiscal total annual compensation for the median of all target team members excluding our ceo was the median team member is employed part time the resulting ratio of our ceos total annual compensation to that of the median of all target team members excluding our ceo for fiscal is to the median team members fiscal total annual compensation was calculated in the same manner used to calculate the ceos compensation in the summary compensation table on page to determine the median team member we used w wages or their equivalent for the calendar year for team members employed as of february the last day of fiscal for all permanent team members who were employed for less than the full fiscal year we calculated a daily pay rate and then annualized their w wages team members hired after december do not have w s so we used annual base salary for exempt permanent team members hired after that date and for non exempt permanent team members hired after that date we multiplied their hourly compensation rate by the average hours worked by all u s non exempt team members to approximate their annual compensation these estimates and assumptions were used to annualize each permanent team members compensation without treating any part time team member as a full time equivalent we included all non u s team members in determining the median team member treated in the same manner described above except that for non u s team members not paid in u s dollars the foreign currency was converted into u s dollars using the applicable currency conversion rate as of february for temporary or seasonal team members we used their w wages without adjustments except that if they were hired after december they have no w s so we used their gross earnings from our payroll records this approach ensures that compensation of temporary or seasonal team members is not annualized since the ceos compensation for fiscal did not include an annual equity grant we are also disclosing the ratio of our ceos annual tdc to the median team members fiscal total annual compensation the ceos annual tdc was and the resulting ratio of our ceos annual tdc to the median team members fiscal total annual compensation is to see page for the calculation of the

or the human resources compensation committee to take any action regarding targets executive compensation practices the final decision on the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and on whether and if so how to address shareholder disapproval remains with the board and the human resources compensation committee the board believes that the human resources compensation committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent objective and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interests of target and its shareholders the board values the opinions of targets shareholders as expressed through their votes and other communications although the resolution is non binding the board will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder opinions received from other communications when making future compensation decisions target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents itemfour shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman john chevedden nelson avenue no redondo beach ca who held more than of shares of common stock on december intends to submit the following resolution to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting the language below in the proposal and shareholders supporting statement is reproduced without alteration proposal proposal independent board chairman shareholders request our board of directors to adopt as policy and amend our governing documents as necessary to require henceforth that the chair of the board of directors whenever possible to be an independent member of the board the board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next ceo transition implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement if the board determines that a chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent the board shall select a new chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as chairman this proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above shareholders supporting statement caterpillar is an example of a company recently changing course and naming an independent board chairman caterpillar had strongly opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman as recently as its annual meeting wells fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman in it was reported that of the standard poors firms separate these positions report chairman and ceo this proposal topic won plus support at major u s companies in including support at netflix this proposal topic received support at the target annual meeting this support was more impressive since it was achieved without small shareholders having the same access to indepemndent corporate governance information as large shareholders having a board chairman who is independent of management is a practice that will promote greater management accountability to shareholders and lead to a more objective evaluation of management an independent chairman is more important at target since our lead director douglas baker received times as many negative votes as certain other target directors plus mr baker is well entrenched as in a ceo position at another company for brian cornell target ceo this is somewhat like answering to a lead director who is a member of the same ceo club perhaps not in the best interest of shareholders mr baker may also be overworked as ceo and as a director at a total of companies plus mr baker chaired the target nomination committee and was a member of the target executive pay committee maybe not so good because an entrenched ceo might be predisposed to raise the pay of a brother ceo meanwhile mr cornell received times as many negative votes as certain other target directors please vote to enhance the oversight of our ceo independent board chairman proposal target corporationtarget corporation proxy statement back to contents position of the board of directors the board believes that any decision to maintain a combined chair ceo role or to separate these roles should be based on targets specific circumstances the independence and capabilities of its directors and the leadership provided by its ceo the board does not believe that separating the roles of chair and ceo should be mandated or that such a separation would by itself deliver additional benefit for shareholders the board has a fiduciary duty to act as it believes to be in the best interests of target and its shareholders in order to meet that duty the board believes it is important to maintain the flexibility to determine which leadership structure best serves those interests as circumstances evolve the proposals offer to phase in the mandatory independent chair policy for the next ceo transition ignores the importance of maintaining that flexibility by mandating a prescribed form of board leadership to an unknown set of circumstances that would apply in the future when the next ceo transition occurs the proposal will unnecessarily limit the boards options in recruiting a successor ceo and applying the leadership structure it believes is in the best interests of target and its shareholders at that time the board believes that its current leadership structure and governance practices allow it to provide effective independent oversight of our company specifically our corporate governance guidelines require us to have a lead independent director with significant responsibilities that are described in detail on page whenever the roles of chair and ceo are combined as they are currently our lead independent director is elected annually by the independent non employee directors independent directors meet frequently in executive sessions that are presided over by our lead independent director with no members of management present independent directors use these executive sessions to discuss matters of concern as well as any matter they deem appropriate including evaluation of the ceo and other senior management management succession planning matters to be included on board agendas board informational needs and board effectiveness the chairpersonsand all membersof the audit finance nominating governance and human resources compensation committees are independent directors these board committee chairpersons determine matters to be discussed and materials to be evaluated in the areas covered by their respective committee charters the board regularly reevaluates its board leadership structure as part of the board evaluation process described under board evaluations and refreshment on page and also does so at the time of any leadership changes the proposals mandatory policy would eliminate that important board responsibility and the boards ability to determine the most effective form of leadership structure even though the proposal has been consistently supported by less than a majority of targets shareholders in the past the topic of this proposal most recently went to a vote at the target annual meeting when it received support of the shares voted through shareholder engagement meetings since that vote we have continued to find that although shareholders express different views on their preferred leadership structure there is no prevailing theme on a preferred structure for target the board is committed to continuing to seek shareholder feedback on its approach as part of its ongoing shareholder outreach efforts and will continue to reassess its approach to this issue on a regular basis the board of directors recommends that shareholders vote against the shareholder proposal to adopt a policy for an independent chairman target corporationtarget
