beneficial owner of a debt security that for u s federal income tax purposes is not a u s holder and that is not a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for u s federal income tax purposes if a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for u s federal income tax purposes holds debt securities the u s federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership a partnership holding debt securities and partners in such a partnership should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the u s

consult their tax advisors with respect to the u s federal state and local and non u s tax consequences relating to the purchase ownership and disposition of the debt securities based on their particular circumstances u s federal income taxation of u s holders payments of interest except as set forth below interest on debt securities generally will be taxable to a u s holder as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time that such interest is paid or accrued in accordance with the u s holder s regular method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes original issue discount special tax accounting rules apply to debt securities issued with original issue discount oid for u s federal income tax purposes oid debt securities in general debt securities will be treated as issued with oid if the issue price of the debt securities is less than their stated redemption price at maturity unless the amount of such difference is de minimis less than of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity regardless of the regular method of accounting used by a u s holder for u s federal income tax purposes oid generally must be accrued into gross income as ordinary income on a constant yield basis in advance of the receipt of some or all of the cash attributable to such oid table of contents however a u s holder generally will not be required to include separately in income cash payments received on oid debt securities even if denominated as interest to the extent those payments do not constitute qualified stated interest payments the issue price of debt securities will be the initial offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold for cash ignoring sales to bond houses brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters placement agents or wholesalers the stated redemption price at maturity of debt securities is the sum of all payments to be made on the debt securities other than qualified stated interest payments a qualified stated interest payment is stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property other than debt securities of the issuer at least annually at a single fixed rate appropriately taking into account the length of the interval between payments see variable rate debt securities below for special rules for debt securities that provide for payments of interest based on certain floating rates for oid debt securities having a term of more than one year the amount of oid includible in gross income by a u s holder of the oid debt securities is the sum of the daily portions of oid with respect to the oid debt securities for each day during the taxable year in which such u s holder held the oid debt securities the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the oid allocable to such accrual period the amount of oid allocable to any accrual period is generally equal to the excess if any of i the product of the adjusted issue price of the oid debt securities at the beginning of such accrual period and the yield to maturity of the oid debt securities as determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period over ii the sum of any qualified stated interest payments allocable to the accrual period for this purpose accrual periods may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the oid debt securities provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs at the beginning or the end of an accrual period the adjusted issue price of oid debt securities at the start of any accrual period is equal to the issue price increased by the accrued oid for each prior accrual period determined without regard to the amortization of any acquisition premium or bond premium as described below and reduced by any prior payments with respect to the oid debt securities that were not qualified stated interest payments the following rules apply to determine the amount of oid allocable to an accrual period if an interval between payments of qualified stated interest contains more than one accrual period the amount of qualified stated interest payable at the end of the interval is allocated on a pro rata basis to each accrual period in the interval and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of each accrual period in the interval must be increased by the amount of any qualified stated interest that has accrued prior to the beginning of the first day of the accrual period but is not payable until the end of the interval if the accrual period is the final accrual period the amount of oid allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity other than a payment of qualified stated interest and the adjusted issue price of the debt security at the beginning of the final accrual period and if all accrual periods are of equal length except for an initial shorter accrual period or an initial and a final shorter accrual period the amount of oid allocable to the initial accrual period may be computed under any reasonable method under the constant yield method for accruing oid a u s holder generally will have to include in gross income increasingly greater amounts of oid in successive accrual periods table of contents debt securities may contain provisions allowing the debt securities to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity date at our option or at the option of holders for purposes of determining yield and maturity debt securities that may be redeemed prior to their stated maturity date at the option of the issuer generally will be treated from the time of issuance as having a maturity date for u s federal income tax purposes on such redemption date if such redemption would result in a lower yield to maturity conversely debt securities that may be redeemed prior to their stated maturity date at the option of the holder generally will be treated from the time of issuance as having a maturity date for u s federal income tax purposes on such redemption date if such redemption would result in a higher yield to maturity if the exercise of such an option does not occur contrary to the assumptions made as of the issue date then solely for purposes of the accrual of oid the debt securities will be treated as reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal to their adjusted issue price if a u s holder owns a debt security issued with de minimis oid such u s holder generally must include the de minimis oid in income at the time principal payments on the debt securities are made in proportion to the amount paid any amount of de minimis oid that a u s holder has included in income will be treated as capital gain we are required to report to the irs the amount of oid accrued in respect of oid debt securities held by persons other than corporations and other exempt holders debt securities issued with contingent payments the tax treatment of a u s holder of a debt security providing for contingent payments will depend on a number of factors including the amount and timing of any contingent payments of principal and interest this summary does not address the tax treatment of contingent payment debt instruments prospective investors of debt securities providing for contingent payments that do not constitute qualified stated interest should examine the applicable prospectus supplement and should consult their own tax advisors regarding u s federal income tax consequences of the holding and disposition of such debt securities short term debt securities in the case of debt securities that have a fixed maturity of one year or less short term debt securities all payments including all payments of stated interest will be included in the stated redemption price at maturity and will not be qualified stated interest the short term debt securities will be treated for u s federal income tax purposes as having been issued with oid in the amount of the difference between their issue price and stated redemption price at maturity unless the u s holder elects to compute oid using tax basis instead of issue price in general u s holders that use the accrual method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes and certain other u s holders are required to accrue oid in respect of short term debt securities into gross income as ordinary income either on a straight line basis or if a u s holder so elects on a constant yield basis using daily compounding u s holders that are individuals and certain other u s holders that use the cash method of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes are not required to accrue oid on short term debt securities in advance of the receipt of payment unless they elect to do so if such a u s holder does not elect to accrue oid on short term debt securities into gross income then gain subsequently recognized upon the sale retirement or other disposition of the short term debt securities generally will be treated as ordinary interest income to the extent of the oid that has accrued through the date of such disposition furthermore a non electing u s holder of short term debt securities may be required to defer deductions for a portion of the u s holder s interest expense with respect to any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry the short term debt securities variable rate debt securities treasury regulations prescribe special rules for variable rate debt instruments that provide for the payment of interest based on certain floating or objective rates in general debt securities will qualify as variable rate debt instruments variable rate debt securities if i the issue price of the debt securities does not exceed the total non contingent principal payments due in respect of the debt securities by more than an amount equal to the lesser of table of contents a multiplied by the product of the total non contingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date or b of the total non contingent principal payments and ii the debt securities provide for stated interest paid or compounded at least annually at current values of a one or more qualified floating rates b a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates c a single objective rate or d a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a qualified inverse floating rate a current value of a rate is the value of the rate on any date that is no earlier than three months prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later than one year following that first day a qualified floating rate is any variable rate where variations in the value of such rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the variable rate debt securities are denominated although a multiple of a qualified floating rate generally will not itself constitute a qualified floating rate a variable rate equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple that is greater than but not more than can constitute a qualified floating rate a variable rate equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple that is greater than but not more than increased or decreased by a fixed rate will also constitute a qualified floating rate in addition two or more qualified floating rates that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the term of the variable rate debt securities e g two or more qualified floating rates with values within basis points of each other as determined on the issue date will be treated as a single qualified floating rate notwithstanding the foregoing a variable rate that would otherwise constitute a qualified floating rate but which is subject to one or more restrictions such as a maximum stated interest rate i e a cap a minimum stated interest rate i e a floor or a restriction on the amount of increase or decrease in the stated interest i e a governor may under certain circumstances fail to be treated as a qualified floating rate unless such restrictions are fixed throughout the term of the variable rate debt securities or are reasonably expected to not have a significant effect on the yield of the variable rate debt securities an objective rate is a rate that is not itself a qualified floating rate but which is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information a rate will not qualify as an objective rate if it is based on information that is within the control of the issuer or a related party or that is unique to the circumstances of the issuer or a related party such as dividends profits or the value of the issuer s stock although a rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely because it is based on the credit quality of the issuer an objective rate is a qualified inverse floating rate if the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate as long as variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate if debt securities provide for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating rate or an objective rate and if the variable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate the fixed rate e g the value of the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the value of the fixed rate by more than basis points then the fixed rate and the variable rate together will constitute either a single qualified floating rate or objective rate as the case may be if variable rate debt securities provide for stated interest at either a single qualified floating rate or a single objective rate throughout their term and such interest is unconditionally payable in cash or property other than debt instruments of the issuer at least annually then all stated interest on such variable rate debt securities will constitute qualified stated interest that is included in gross income by u s holders as received or accrued in accordance with their regular methods of accounting for u s federal income tax purposes thus such variable rate debt securities generally will not be treated as having been issued with oid unless the variable rate securities are sold at a discount from their stated principal amount subject to a de minimis exception in general the amount of qualified stated interest and oid if any that accrues during an accrual period on such variable rate debt securities is table of contents determined under the rules described above by assuming that the variable rate is a fixed rate equal to i in the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate the value as of the issue date of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate or ii in the case of an objective rate other than a qualified inverse floating rate a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable rate debt securities the qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period is increased or decreased if the interest actually paid during an accrual period exceeds or is less than the interest that was accrued under the foregoing approach for other variable rate debt securities the timing and amount of oid and qualified stated interest will be determined by converting the variable rate debt securities into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments the conversion of the variable rate debt securities into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments generally involves substituting for any qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate a fixed rate equal to the value of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate as the case may be as of the issue date or substituting for any objective rate other than a qualified inverse floating rate a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable rate debt securities in the case of variable rate debt securities that provide for stated interest at a fixed rate in addition to either one or more qualified floating rates or a qualified inverse floating rate the fixed rate is initially converted into a qualified floating rate or a qualified inverse floating rate if the variable rate debt securities provide for a qualified inverse floating rate under such circumstances the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate that replaces the fixed rate must be such that the fair market value of the variable rate debt securities as of their issue date is approximately the same as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for either the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate rather than the fixed rate subsequent to converting the fixed rate into either a qualified floating rate or a qualified inverse floating rate the variable rate debt securities are then converted into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments in the manner described above once the variable rate debt securities are converted into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments pursuant to the foregoing rules the timing and amount of oid and qualified stated interest if any are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments by applying the general oid rules to the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments a u s holder of such variable rate debt securities will account for oid and qualified stated interest as if the u s holder held the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments for each accrual period appropriate adjustments will be made to the amount of qualified stated interest or oid assumed to have been accrued or paid with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments in the event that such amounts differ from the actual amount of interest accrued or paid on the variable rate debt securities during the accrual period market discount if a u s holder purchases debt securities other than debt securities purchased at original issue at or above the issue price and other than short term debt securities for an amount that is less than their stated redemption price at maturity or in the case of oid debt securities their revised issue price the amount of the difference will be treated as market discount for u s federal income tax purposes unless that difference is less than a specified de minimis amount under the market discount rules a u s holder generally will be required to treat any principal payment and any gain derived from the sale retirement or other disposition of the debt securities as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that has accrued on the debt securities on a ratable basis or at the election of the u s holder a constant yield basis but has not previously been included in gross income by the u s holder in addition a u s holder may be required to defer until the maturity of the debt securities or their earlier disposition in a taxable transaction the deduction of all or a portion of any interest expense incurred on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry such debt securities a u s holder may elect to currently include market discount in gross income as it accrues under either a ratable or constant yield method in which case the rules described above regarding characterization of payments and gain as ordinary income and the deferral of interest deductions will table of contents not apply an election to currently include market discount in gross income once made applies to all market discount obligations acquired by the u s holder on or after the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors before making this election acquisition premium if a u s holder acquires oid debt securities for an amount greater than their adjusted issue price but equal to or less than the sum of all amounts other than qualified stated interest payable with respect to the oid debt securities after the date of acquisition the oid debt securities will be treated as acquired at an acquisition premium for oid debt securities acquired with acquisition premium the amount of oid that the u s holder must include in gross income with respect to the oid debt securities for any taxable year will be reduced by the portion of acquisition premium properly allocable to such taxable year amortizable bond premium if a u s holder purchases debt securities for an amount in excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the debt securities after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest the u s holder will be considered to have purchased the debt securities at a premium for u s federal income tax purposes in such case the u s holder generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the debt securities on a constant yield method as an offset to interest includible in gross income with respect to the debt securities and the u s holder would not be required to include oid if any in gross income in respect of the debt securities in the case of debt securities that provide for alternative payment schedules the amount of premium generally is determined by assuming that a holder will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that maximizes the holder s yield and that the issuer will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that minimizes the holder s yield although the issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise a call option in a manner that maximizes the holder s yield any election to amortize premium would apply to all debt securities other than debt securities the interest on which is excludable from gross income held or subsequently acquired by a u s holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and is irrevocable without the consent of the irs prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors before making this election election to treat all interest as oid u s holders may elect to treat all interest in respect of debt securities as oid and to calculate the amount includible in gross income for any taxable year under the constant yield method described above for purposes of this election interest includes stated interest acquisition discount oid de minimis oid market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium if a u s holder makes this election for debt securities with amortizable bond premium the election is treated as an election under the amortizable bond premium rules described above and the electing u s holder will be required to amortize bond premium for all other debt instruments with amortizable bond premium held or subsequently acquired by the u s holder the election to treat all interest as oid must be made for the taxable year in which the u s holder acquires the debt securities and the election may not be revoked without the consent of the irs prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors before making this election sale retirement or other taxable disposition of debt securities upon the sale retirement or other taxable disposition of debt securities a u s holder generally will recognize u s source gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale retirement or other taxable disposition other than amounts representing accrued and unpaid qualified stated interest which will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in gross income and the u s holder s adjusted tax basis of the debt securities in general the u s holder s adjusted tax basis of the debt securities will equal the u s holder s cost for the debt securities increased by all accrued oid or market discount previously included in gross income and reduced by any amortized premium and any cash payments previously received in respect of the debt securities other than qualified stated interest table of contents payments except as described above with respect to certain short term debt securities and debt securities acquired at a market discount and except with respect to contingent payment debt instruments and gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates which this summary generally does not discuss such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale retirement or other taxable disposition the debt securities have been held for more than one year under current u s federal income tax law certain non corporate u s holders including individuals are eligible for preferential rates of u s federal income taxation in respect of long term capital gains the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the code medicare tax a u s holder that is an individual or estate or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt from such tax will be subject to a tax on the lesser of the u s holder s net investment income in the case of individuals or undistributed net investment income in the case of estates and trusts for the relevant taxable year and the excess of the u s holder s modified adjusted gross income in the case of individuals or adjusted gross income in the case of estates and trusts for the taxable year over a certain threshold a u s holder s net investment income
