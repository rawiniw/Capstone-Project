during the firstquarter of we have paid dividends every quarter since our initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future short term and long term financingour financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities within these parameters we seek to minimize our borrowing costs our ability to access the long term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings as of april our credit ratings were as follows creditratingsmoodysstandardandpoorsfitchlong term debta aa commercial paperp a f if our credit ratings were lowered our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above we have additional liquidity through a committed billion revolving credit facility that expires in october no balances were outstanding at any time during or most of our long term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels in addition to a secured debt level covenant our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant we are and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants additionally at april no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a debt rating downgrade except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both i a change in control and ii our long term debt ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade or our long term debt ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is noninvestment grade we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives fund the remaining settlement of debt tendered during the

provisions of this section q shall apply to an executive if the auditor determines that each of a and b below are applicable a payments hereunder determined without application of this section q either alone or together with other payments in the nature of compensation to the executive which are contingent on or accelerated by a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation or otherwise would result in any portion of the payments hereunder being subject to an excise tax on excess parachute payments imposed under code section b the excise tax imposed on the executive under section of the code on excess parachute payments from whatever source would result in a lesser net aggregate present value of payments and distributions to the executive after subtraction of the excise tax than if payments and distributions to the executive were reduced to the maximum amount that could be made without incurring the excise tax under this section q the payments under this officer icp shall be reduced but not below zero so that the present value of such payments and distributions shall equal the reduced amount the reduced amount which may be zero shall be an amount expressed as the present value of the payments and distributions under this officer icp that can be made without causing such

eliminations or reductions if any have been made under the corporation s long term incentive plan if the auditor determines that this section q is applicable to an executive it shall so advise the corporation the corporation shall then promptly give the executive notice to that effect together with a copy of the detailed calculation supporting such determination which shall include a statement of the reduced amount such notice shall also include a description of which and how much of the payments shall be eliminated or reduced as long as after such election the aggregate present value of the payments equals the reduced amount for purposes of this section q present value shall be determined in accordance with section g of the code all the foregoing determinations made by the auditor under this section q shall be made as promptly as practicable after it is determined that parachute payments will be made to the executive if an elimination or reduction is not made as promptly as practicable following the election hereunder the corporation shall pay to or for the benefit of the executive such amounts as are then due to the executive under this officer icp and shall promptly pay to or for the benefit of the executive in the future such amounts as become due to the executive under this officer icp as a result of the uncertainty in the application of section g of the code at the time of the initial determination by the auditor hereunder it is possible that payments under this officer icp will have been made which should not have been made overpayment or that additional payments which will have not been made could have been made underpayment in each case consistent with the calculation of the reduced amount hereunder in the event that the auditor based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the internal revenue service against the corporation or the executive which the auditor believes has a high probability of success determines that an overpayment has been made any such overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the executive which the executive shall repay together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f of the code provided however that no amount shall be payable by the executive if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to the excise tax under section of the code in the event that the auditor based upon controlling precedent determines that an underpayment has occurred any such underpayment shall be promptly paid to or for the benefit of the executive together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in section f a of the code in making its determination under this section q the value of any non cash benefit shall be determined by the auditor in accordance with the principles of section g d of the code all determinations made by the auditor under this section q shall be binding upon the corporation and the executive claims
