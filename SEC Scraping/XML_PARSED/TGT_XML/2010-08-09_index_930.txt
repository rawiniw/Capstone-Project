august mr h christopher owings assistant director united states securities and exchange commission division of corporation finance f street n e mail stop washington d c re target corporation amendment no to form k for the fiscal year ended january filed march definitive proxy statement on schedule a filed april file no dear mr owings thank you for your letter dated july regarding target corporation following this introductory section is a specific response to each of your numbered comments in that letter with a portion of your comments in italics preceding each related response as a company we place a high priority on providing clear and useful disclosures to the readers of our sec filings and we always welcome the opportunity to review our practices in an effort to make our disclosures even better we believe our responses address your comments should the staff after review and consideration of our responses have further questions or comments we would welcome direct dialogue and collaboration to discuss suggestions for future filings form k for the fiscal year ended january item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations page we note that your discussion in this section provides limited analysis of the factors that influenced your financial results for example in discussing comparable store sales on page you state that transaction level metrics are influenced by a broad array of factors but you provide no analysis of these factors or how they affected your comparable store sales please expand your discussion to address whether you believe factors that you identify constitute a trend and whether you expect that trend to continue please also provide analysis concerning the quality and variability of your earnings and cash flows so that investors can ascertain the likelihood or the elxtent past performance is nicollet mall minneapolis mn mr h christopher owings page of indicative of future performance please discuss whether you expect levels to remain at this level or to increase or decrease further please discuss in reasonable detail economic or industry wide factors relevant to your company material opportunities challenges and risk in the short and long term and the actions you are taking to address them targets response to comment in response to your letter we reviewed the mda disclosures in our most recent form k your letter requested that we expand our discussion to include additional analysis of certain metrics and to address whether we believe the factors that we identified constitute a trend and whether we expect that trend to continue with respect to your comment about providing guidance to investors on the likelihood that our results are indicative of future performance we typically provide such guidance in the outlook section of our mda and as such a response to this comment is provided in our response to comment no below we operate large format general merchandise and food discount stores across the united states our stores offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and food items given the geographic dispersion of our stores across the united states and the breadth of our merchandise offerings our results are highly dependent upon the general economic conditions within the united states but no single factor or small group of factors drives our sales or gross margin results for this reason our discussion and analysis of our sales and gross margin results typically focuses on sales trends during the most recent period as compared with the corresponding prior year period and the mix of sales between discretionary and nondiscretionary products both of which are primary drivers of our gross margin performance additionally we plan our business expenses in light of our general sales outlook to maintain an appropriate level of selling general and administrative expenses in light of expected sales again no single factor or small group of factors determines our expense rate after reviewing our disclosures we continue to believe that they adequately describe and analyze the factors driving the key metrics of our business we reviewed the disclosures describing each of the key metrics within our retail segment sales gross margin rate sga expense rate and depreciation expense rate and the disclosures describing our credit segment performance we believe that our disclosures are appropriate and adequate for example the key metrics in sales are fully described in mda including a detailed table of the components of comparable store sales an important retail industry metric weve identified the two key components number of transactions and average transaction amount and we further subdivided average transaction amount into units per transaction and selling price per unit our sales are affected by broad factors such as changing mix of our guests discretionary and nondiscretionary purchases the transfer of sales from existing stores to new stores and market share gains from other retailers while these factors certainly affect our sales the effect of each such factor cannot be measured with reasonable precision in addition sales are comprised of approximately billion individual annual transactions which are influenced by a wide array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors and sometimes even by uncharacteristic weather patterns making meaningful analysis of transaction level metrics mr h christopher owings page of indeterminable we attempted to describe our inability to provide additional meaningful analysis of these metrics with the sentence that reads transaction level metrics are influenced by a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and comparable store sales rates are negatively impacted by transfer of sales to new stores based on your comment and our additional review of these disclosures we believe that we could provide a better description of our inability to further analyze these transaction level metrics so in future filings we intend to modify this sentence to read as follows the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic competitive and consumer behavioral factors as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible in light of the purpose and underlying objectives of mda we are not aware of any trend economic or industry wide factors opportunities challenges or risks that were known at the date of the filing of our most recent form k that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or operating performance other than those matters that were included in our filing we will continue to endeavor to provide meaningful disclosures that meet the objectives of mda and will make disclosures of material trends economic or industry wide factors opportunities challenges and risks of which we become aware in our future filings outlook page please expand your discussion in the first paragraph of this section on page to explain the basis for your belief that comparable store sales and total sales will increase please also expand your discussion to explain your statement in the same paragraph that comparable store sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall targets response to comment as noted in response above our stores are located across the united states and offer a wide assortment of general merchandise and food items these factors make our results highly dependent upon the general economic conditions within the united states but no single factor or group of a few factors drives our results for this reason our forecasts of future results are largely dependent upon our results during corresponding prior year periods and our expectations about the general economic conditions in the united states we use our analysis of recent results and our judgment and experience to develop our expectations which are described in the outlook section of mda in future filings we will attempt to expand our description of such matters an example of the type of disclosure that we intend to provide is as follows added disclosure is in bold italics mr h christopher owings page of outlook we expect a generally improving economy in and if that occurs and we are able to plan our merchandise assortment appropriately and maintain disciplined expense control we expect to deliver improved profit in both of our business segments in the retail segment we expect to generate increases in comparable store sales likely in the range of to percent for the year as a result of our expectations of a generally improving economy and a percentage point lift from our remodel program while our comparable store sales comparisons are easier in the spring than the fall i e spring comparable store sales declined more than fall comparable store sales the expected incremental sales resulting from remodels will grow as the year progresses additionally we expect total sales to increase by a mid single digit percentage for these same reasons and also due to incremental sales from new stores definitive proxy statement on schedule a filed april committees page nominating and governance committee page we note your disclosure on page that board candidates are evaluated such that the board contains a predominance of business backgrounds that has a diverse set of experiences and perspectives please expand your disclosure to clarify whether you have a policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying your director nominees and if so describe how this policy is implemented and how your committee assesses the effectiveness of the policy targets response to comment the board has adopted corporate governance guidelines which are publicly available and among other things indicate the boards desire that its members have broad perspective experience and knowledge the nominating and governance committee does not have a separate policy regarding consideration of gender ethnic or other diversity criteria in identifying director nominees and we will clarify this in future filings as disclosed on pages and of the proxy statement the committee adheres to our corporate governance guidelines and considers the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of all of our directors as a factor when recommending directors this is one of several factors that are considered and there is no specific policy on how this particular factor is to be applied accordingly we did not provide the disclosure required by the last sentence of item c vi of regulation s k mr h christopher owings page of executive compensation page we note that you have not included any disclosure in response to item s of regulation s k please advise us of the basis for your conclusion that item s disclosure is not necessary and describe the process you undertook to reach that conclusion targets response to comment we concluded that we did not have a disclosure obligation under item s of regulation s k because in our judgment our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on target in arriving at this conclusion our human resources function first inventoried all compensation policies and practices for our employees including those applicable to executive officers and those applicable below the executive officer level these arrangements and policies were analyzed under a risk assessment framework intended to identify any risk taking incentives inherent in our compensation policies and practices identify internal controls or offsetting policies that mitigate any such risks and determine whether any resulting risks were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company as part of our review we took numerous factors into consideration including whether any of our compensation policies and practices varied significantly from the overall risk and reward structure of our company and whether any of our compensation policies and practices incentivized individuals in a manner that would be inconsistent with our strategic goals or would exacerbate any of the inherent enterprise risks to which we are subject once this analysis was completed we reviewed the approach and the conclusions with senior management responsible for risk oversight including our general counsel the head of internal audit and the head of our corporate risk and responsibility function all of whom agreed with the conclusion compensation discussion and analysis page executive summary page please expand your bullet point discussion beginning at the bottom of page or elsewhere as appropriate to describe your policies for allocation of different forms of compensation your disclosure at the top of page provides a general explanation of your rationale for favoring variable and long term compensation but you do not discuss your rationale for allocating amongst the several different forms of compensation you provide such as restricted stock units performance share units and options mr h christopher owings page of targets response to comment to address this comment and comment no in future filings we intend to revise the section of our cda captioned benchmarking elements and amounts on pp to read substantially as set forth on exhibit a to this letter we believe this revised approach will concisely and adequately describe our rationale and method of determining compensation amounts in the aggregate and allocating aggregate compensation among the primary elements compensation positioning page you reference performance at goal throughout your discussion on page but it does not appear that you explain this reference until page further your disclosure on page does not definitively clarify whether performance at goal is equivalent to performance goals please revise your disclosure on page to provide context for your use of performance at goal in describing your compensation plans targets response to comment in future filings we will explain our references to performance at goal when that term is first used we will also use consistent terms when referring to performance at goal and clarify that our references to goal are similar to the secs use of the word target when referring to performance levels under incentive compensation plans we use the word goal instead of target in our cda to avoid confusion with our corporate name your discussion on page summarizes the general parameters used in determining your named executive officers compensation and your disclosure beginning on page states the threshold and goal amounts for each compensation element but the specific formula used in determining compensation amounts is not provided please revise or advise in this regard we note your statement on page that personal performance payouts are discretionary and based on subjective individual performance factors nevertheless it appears that you can provide a formula for each of the non subjective elements of compensation targets response to comment in future filings we will add to our existing disclosure regarding the financial performance required for incentive compensation payments to illustrate the incentive compensation opportunity to named executive officers neos at various levels of financial and personal performance attached as exhibit b to this letter is an additional table with accompanying narrative that we will include in future filings to explain this relationship under our short term incentive plan mr h christopher owings page of we note your indication that the compensation committee capped spring season payouts however it is not clear at what level you capped these amounts in other words explain whether you capped them at the goal amounts or utilized a stretch amount targets response to comment in future filings we will revise our table captioned non equity incentive plan performance results fiscal to clarify any cap on payouts exhibit c attached to this letter is an example of how we propose to present this table using our fiscal numbers compensation actions table page please expand your disclosure on page to specify the benefit to investors of your compensation actions table and ensure that it is de emphasized in relation to the prominence of your summary compensation table on page please also ensure that any differences between the amounts reflected in your compensation actions table and those reflected in your summary compensation table or other required tables are clearly disclosed targets response to comment in future filings in which we determine to include an alternate presentation of the summary compensation table we will de emphasize its prominence in relation to the summary compensation table and describe the reasons why we believe it is important to investors our response to comment no further explains our reasons for using an alternate table in our proxy statement key performance measures and performance goals page in the first full paragraph on page you refer to variable compensation plans and your short term and long term incentive compensation plans please revise your discussion to clarify the difference if any between these plans if you are referencing the same plans please use consistent terms to describe the plans targets response comment to our variable compensation plans consist of our short term and long term incentive compensation plans accordingly the two terms quoted in your comment refer to the same compensation plans in future filings we will use consistent terms or more clearly explain how the terms are related mr h christopher owings page of personal performance page in the first paragraph on page you state that personal performance payments are based on subjective management criteria and you provide examples of those criteria please confirm whether these are all of the criteria considered in awarding personal performance payments to each of your named executive officers and if not disclose all additional criteria considered please also clarify if different criteria are applied to each named executive officer and specify which criteria apply to which officer s targets response comment to in determining the personal performance score of our executive team including all neos but excluding the ceo we confirm that their strategic team and ethical leadership in delivering results are the criteria used to measure personal performance and award a personal performance review score although we do not currently consider additional disclosure necessary in future filings we will consider and if appropriate disclose whether there were any special events acts or undertakings of each neo outside of the disclosed qualities criteria that positively or negatively affected their personal score if the personal performance amounts discussed in this section are reflected in the bonus column of your summary compensation table please make that clear or disclose elsewhere how the bonus amounts are determined targets response to comment we believe we have addressed this comment in our response to comment and our revised disclosure on exhibit b additional compensation elements page please revise to elaborate upon how you arrived at the amount of compensation you determined to grant in the form of rsus and stock options targets response to comment please see our response to comment above in which we provide additional disclosure on exhibit a explaining how we determined the relative amount of each type of long term incentive award mr h christopher owings page of summary compensation table page we note your disclosure in footnote one to your summary compensation table that you did not include a restricted stock award paid to mr steinhafel because it was granted in fiscal year please note that compensation earned in a fiscal year should be included in that years summary compensation table even if the compensation is not granted until a subsequent fiscal year as a result it is unclear to us why you have not reflected this amount in the table please advise targets response comment to we did not include the restricted stock award granted to mr steinhafel in march fiscal in the summary compensation table reporting compensation earned in fiscal because of the guidance set forth in sec release no on pages of sec release no the commission noted that the final rules require disclosure of awards granted during the year in this release the commission acknowledged comments requesting that the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards be included in the year for which the related services were rendered however the commission noted that multiple subjective factors could influence equity awards granted after the fiscal year end and determined to adopt a more objective approach based on reporting the award in the year when the grant date occurred the commission went on to suggest that companies use cda to explain the post fiscal year equity awards and consider using a supplemental table if necessary the restricted stock award granted in march while related to payment of mr steinhafels annual incentive compensation was not contemplated at the outset of fiscal nor was it within mr steinhafels discretion to elect to receive equity rather the compensation committee exercised its discretion after fiscal to award a portion of his payout in the form of restricted stock as a result the situation is distinguishable from regulation s k compliance and disclosure interpretations which contemplates a non equity incentive plan award as opposed to an equity award and which predates release no and also does not appear to involve an equity award based on what we understand to be the final position of the commission we did not include the aggregate grant date fair value of the restricted stock award granted in fiscal in mr steinhafels compensation for fiscal as reported in our summary compensation table however to explain that the grant related to services performed in fiscal we included a footnote setting forth the aggregate grant date fair value of the award so that a reader could calculate the amount of total compensation including this award if they so chose and also used a supplemental table in our cda to highlight this timing difference mr h christopher owings page of we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filings that staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filings and that we may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the united states on behalf of target corporation i thank you for your consideration of our responses sincerely s douglas a scovanner douglas a scovanner executive vice president and chief financial officer exhibita setting amount of compensation and allocation among elements for each executive officer position we use market data from our benchmark companies to establish a targeted level of total direct compensation tdc which is the sum of three elements base salary short term incentive compensation and long term incentive compensation our targeted level of tdc for executive officers is intended to fall near the thpercentile of our retail peer group and the thpercentile of our general industry peer group for comparable positions our reasons for using these percentiles are to ensure we can attract and retain the best available management talent our belief that the job scope and performance expectations of our senior management are higher than our peer companies and with respect to our retail peer group the fact that we are among the largest companies in this peer group because some compensation elements have a performance based variable payout feature our targeting of tdc is done using at goal levels of payouts in other words we assume at goal payment levels under our short term incentive program and for determining the value of psu awards all equity awards are valued at their grant date fair value for purposes of targeting tdc we allocate tdc among the compensation elements by using market data from our benchmark companies this is done both by direct comparison of the amount of each element with benchmark data and also using data on the relative weightings of different elements by our peer companies this market data is used to establish a range for each element that is used as a reference point to determine a final compensation opportunity that is in line with market conditions yet maintains a strong bias in favor of long term and performance based compensation element description percent of tdc base salary base salary is based on the size and scope of each position individual expertise experience and performance ceo
