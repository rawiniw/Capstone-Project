re target corporationform k for the fiscal year ended january filed march file no dear mr thompson thank you for your letter dated march regarding target corporation following this introductory section are your comments in italics and our responses we place a high priority on providing clear and useful disclosures to the readers of our sec filings and we welcome the opportunity to review our practices to make our disclosures even better we believe our responses address your comments should the staff have further questions or comments we would welcome direct dialogue and collaboration to discuss suggestions for future filings notes to consolidated financial statements notes to consolidated financial statementsconsolidation we note you consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that you are the primary beneficiary please tell us what consideration you gave to disclosing the information required by asc aa regarding your involvement with variable interest entities the disclosures required by asc with respect to variable interest entities you consolidate as the primary beneficiary and the disclosures required by asc with respect to variable interest entities you do not consolidate because you are not the primary beneficiary targets response to comment we consolidate four variable interest entities vies because we are the primary beneficiary these entities are physician owned professional corporations previously operated as target clinics within stores in certain states assets liabilities sales and expenses of these combined entities each were less than percent of consolidated amounts for the years ended january january and february for this reason we concluded that the omission of disclosures required by asc aa and asc would not influence the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon our financial statements we sold the clinic business operations associated with the four immaterial consolidated vies to cvs in december these legal entities have no remaining assets or liabilities we have initiated the dissolution process for these entities and anticipate final termination in upon dissolution we will no longer have a variable interest in these vies and unless otherwise applicable will omit reference to consolidation of vies in the summary of accounting policies of future filings we have only one vie that we do not consolidate the target canada employee trust the trust the trust relates to the target canada exit and is controlled by a third party trustee and a canadian court because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trust we are not the primary beneficiary target has no adverse economic exposure to the trust because it was fully funded in in addition any potential pretax benefit to target was limited to million as of january an immaterial amount we believe that our involvement with this vie is immaterial and the omission of disclosures in asc would not influence the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon our financial statements pharmacies and clinics transaction page you disclose cvs will operate the pharmacy and clinic businesses in your stores under a perpetual operating agreement and cvs will make annual inflation adjusted occupancy related payments we also note rental income from cvs referenced on page please tell us more about this transaction clarify for us what you mean by occupancy related payments whether all or a portion represent lease payments and tell us your consideration of asc as it relates to your agreement s with cvs explain your basis for recording the occupancy related payments as a reduction to sga expense your consideration of sab topic a and the term of the annual occupancy related payments if other than perpetual tell us the key assumptions used in your discounted cash flow analysis in determining the estimated fair value of the leasehold interest targets response to comment clarify for us what you mean by occupancy related payments whether all or a portion represent lease payments and tell us your consideration of asc as it relates to your agreement s with cvs under the terms of the agreements cvs paid us million in cash at the date of sale of the million cash received million was allocated to deferred lease income i e prepaid rent based upon the relative fair value of the assets sold which consisted of our pharmacy and clinic businesses and the leasehold interest granted to cvs to use space within our stores in addition cvs will make monthly occupancy related payments to us the legal agreements describe the occupancy related payments as a payment for the space equipment common area maintenance utilities and other items the provision for the occupancy related payments is not intended to allow and does not permit target to share in cvss fees or revenues from the operation of pharmacies and clinics in our stores the prepaid rent and monthly occupancy related payments combined represent the total lease payments we evaluated asc and concluded that the arrangement contains a lease because cvs has the perpetual right subject to termination only in limited circumstances to use specified assets in exchange for consideration we evaluated the asc lease classification criteria and determined that the lease meets the criterion under asc c because the term is more than percent of the remaining economic useful life the leased stores as a lessor we also evaluated the incremental criteria of asc and noted that the lease meets the collectability and no important uncertainties criteria we then assessed the criteria in asc thru to determine the lease classification ownership does not transfer to the lessee at the end of the term in addition at lease inception the carrying amount of the leased space did not equal the fair value for these reasons the lease does not meet the criteria to be classified as a sales type direct financing or leveraged lease accordingly we have classified the lease as operating explain your basis for recording the occupancy related payments as a reduction to sga expense your consideration of sab topic a and the term of the annual occupancy related payments if other than perpetual as noted above under the terms of the agreements cvs paid us million in cash at the date of sale and will pay monthly occupancy related payments to us over the perpetual lifetime of the agreement the agreements are not intended to allow and do not permit target to share in the fees or revenue earned by cvs from their operations of pharmacies and clinics in our stores we do not earn a commission from cvs product sales the monthly payments cvs will make to target will be unrelated to the actual results of their operations sab topic a contemplated whether the staff would object to retailers including sales of leased or licensed departments within total revenue as noted above the payments we will receive from cvs are not derived from the sales or results of cvss operations in our stores further the combined amortization of the deferred lease income and monthly occupancy related payments will equal less than percent of our total revenue significantly below the threshold for separate disclosure in our consolidated statements of operations under rule of regulation s x although immaterial we believe any gross margin benefit that would result from including this activity within sales would be inconsistent with the intent and nature of the payments for these reasons we believe that recording these amounts within sga expenses with disclosure appropriately characterizes the intent and nature of the payments tell us the key assumptions used in your discounted cash flow analysis in determining the estimated fair value of the leasehold interest we engaged a third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the leasehold interest we used the income approach a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of the leasehold interest our location by location analysis used the anticipated revenue and expense for each pharmacy and clinic over the estimated lease term because each space occupied by cvs is a store within a store with no separate entrance we do not believe the cost and market approaches are appropriate due to the absence of reliable building and other data we used the following key assumptions lease termbecause the agreement is perpetual we used the average remaining accounting useful lives of our store i e building portfolio to establish an implied lease term of years initial market rentwe estimated initial market rent on a triple net basis by multiplying stabilized sales by an occupancy cost percentage on a store by store basis the occupancy cost percentage was based on public company filings of national chain drug pharmacy retail businesses and other market data in evaluating the sources we noted that national chain drug stores over square feet have occupancy costs ranging from percent to percent generally the larger the retailer the lower the occupancy cost percentage target stores are typically square feet or larger therefore we believe an assumption below the midpoint of this range is most appropriate for this reason we used a percent base occupancy cost percentage with minor adjustments made to individual locations based on prescription volume property type clinic vs non clinic and location suburban vs urban annual rent growth ratewe applied an annual rent growth rate of percent based on market data the market data indicated that an acceptable amount could be in the range from percent to percent with an average of percent because most of the stores are suburban areas that typically have lower annual rent increases than urban areas we believe an amount slightly below the average is appropriate discount ratewe used an percent discount rate based on market data including national chain drug pharmacy retail business capitalization rates adjusted to reflect the store within a store concept we believe that each of these assumptions was appropriate and well within a reasonable range of possible assumptions pension and postretirement health care plans page with reference to the specific authoritative guidance on which you relied please tell us the basis in gaap for your accounting for the discontinuance of the postretirement health benefits and recognition of the curtailment gain during targets response to comment in the third quarter of we amended and communicated the discontinuance of our unfunded postretirement health care plan effective april we accounted for the plan changes as a negative plan amendment and curtailment as illustrated in asc thru because the changes resulted in a reduction of benefits attributed to employee service already rendered and eliminated eligibility of a significant number of employees previously expected to receive benefits in accordance with asc the effects were applied as of the plan amendment date because we communicated the changes to plan participants within a reasonable period of time in accordance with asc we firstremeasured the plan obligation resulting in a million reduction in the accumulated postretirement health care benefit obligation apbo and a corresponding pretax million reduction in the net actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci we then recorded a million reduction in the apbo for the negative plan amendment asc requires that the reduction in the apbo would first reduce any unamortized prior service cost in aoci then reduce any transition obligation remaining in aoci and any excess would be amortized as a component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost at the date of the amendment million of unamortized negative prior service cost remained and no unamortized transition obligation existed after adding the additional negative prior service cost resulting from the current amendment unamortized prior service cost totaled million in accordance with asc the impact of accounting for the curtailment is limited to accelerating the recognition of the portion of remaining negative prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to those employees who are no longer eligible for future benefits the million gain was not offset by other effects of the curtailment and therefore was recognized as income during the quarter ended october we amortized the remaining million of negative prior service cost over the six month life of the plan we acknowledge that we are responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure in the filing that staff comments or changes to disclosure in response to staff comments do not foreclose the commission from taking any action with respect to the filing and that we may not assert staff comments as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the commission or any person under the federal securities laws of the united states on behalf of target corporation i thank you for your consideration of our response
