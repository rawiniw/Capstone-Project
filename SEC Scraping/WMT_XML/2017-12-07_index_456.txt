<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DTC has advised as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a &#147;banking organization&#148;
within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#147;clearing corporation&#148; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a &#147;clearing agency&#148; registered pursuant to the
provisions of Section&nbsp;17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities that DTC&#146;s participating organizations, referred to as &#147;direct DTC participants,&#148; deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the clearance and post-trade settlement
among direct DTC participants of sales and other securities transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in direct DTC participants&#146; accounts at DTC, thereby eliminating
the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct DTC participants include both U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers (including underwriters of our debt securities), banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of which, and/or their representatives, indirectly own DTC. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation, or &#147;DTTC,&#148; which
is the holding company for the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, and the Emerging Markets Clearing Corporation, each of which is a registered clearing organization. The users of DTTC&#146;s regulated
subsidiaries&#146; services own DTTC. Indirect access to the DTC system is also available to others, referred to as &#147;indirect DTC participants&#148; and together with direct DTC participants, referred to as &#147;DTC participants,&#148; such as
U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct DTC participant, either directly or
indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and the DTC participants are on file with the SEC. According to DTC, the foregoing information with respect to DTC has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not
intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beneficial interests in a global note representing
our outstanding debt securities and registered in the name of DTC or the nominee of DTC will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global note will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and DTC participants. When you
purchase such debt securities, the purchases must be effected by or through a direct DTC participant, which will receive credit for the debt securities in its account on DTC&#146;s records. Upon that purchase, you will become the beneficial owner of
the purchased debt securities. If you purchase through a direct DTC participant, your interest will be recorded on the records of the direct DTC participant. If you purchase through an indirect DTC participant, your interest will be recorded on the
records of the indirect DTC participant, while the direct DTC participant through which the purchase is effected will reflect ownership of those debt securities in the account it maintains for the indirect DTC participant. Neither DTC nor we will
have any knowledge of your individual ownership of the debt securities. When you purchase debt securities through the DTC system, you will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from
DTC. You should instead receive these confirmations and account statements from the DTC participant through which you purchase the debt securities. The DTC participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers,
including, if you are a customer of such DTC participant, any beneficial interests you may hold in our debt securities. </P>

securities is registered, whether DTC or its nominee, as the owner of such global note for all purposes. Accordingly, the trustee will pay all amounts payable with respect to such debt securities to the registered holder of such global note. It is
DTC&#146;s current practice, upon receipt of any payment of distributions or liquidation amounts due on a global note, to proportionately credit direct DTC participants&#146; accounts on the payment date based on their holdings of the relevant
securities. Payments to you with respect to your beneficial interest in any of our debt securities in turn will be the responsibility of the DTC participants based on their respective customary practices, and the trustee, any paying agent and we
will have no direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due on a global note to you or any other beneficial owners in that global note. We or, at our request, the trustee will send any redemption notices regarding debt securities of which you
are the beneficial owner directly to DTC. In accordance with current practice, DTC will, in turn, inform the DTC participants, which will then contact you as a beneficial holder of the debt securities that are the subject of the redemption notice.
DTC&#146;s current practice is to pass through any consent or voting rights to the direct DTC participants by using an omnibus proxy. Those direct DTC participants should, in turn, solicit votes and consents from you, as the ultimate owner of debt
securities, either directly or through the indirect DTC participant through which you hold the debt securities, or provide you with a proxy based on their respective customary practices. As a general proposition, we understand that under existing
industry practices, if we request the holders of our debt securities to take, or if a beneficial owner of our debt securities wants to take, any action that a holder of such debt securities is entitled to take under the indenture, DTC would
authorize the direct DTC participants holding the relevant beneficial interests in such debt securities to take that action. The DTC participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to take that action or would otherwise act upon
the instructions of beneficial owners holding our debt securities through such DTC participants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under applicable rules, regulations and
procedures, DTC must make book-entry transfers of our debt securities represented by global notes registered in the name of DTC or its nominee between direct DTC participants and receive and transmit distributions of principal of, premium, if any,
on, interest on and the redemption price for such debt securities to the direct DTC participants whose accounts are credited with such debt securities as their interests appear. Those DTC participants with which investors have accounts to which such
debt securities are credited must make similar book-entry transfers and receive and transmit payments on behalf of their respective customers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because DTC can only act on behalf of direct DTC participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect DTC participants and certain banks, the
ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a security held in DTC to transfer or pledge that interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of that interest, may be affected
by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest. The laws of some states of the United States require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form in order to transfer or perfect a security interest
in those securities. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a security held in DTC to those persons or to perfect such a security interest may be limited. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DTC has advised that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities under the terms and conditions of the debt
securities (including, without limitation, the presentation of debt securities for exchange) only at the direction of one or more of the direct DTC participants to whose accounts with DTC interests in the relevant debt securities are credited, and
only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which that direct DTC participant has or those direct DTC participants have given the direction. </P>

transactions between Euroclear participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and
cash. Transactions may now be settled through Euroclear in many currencies, including United States dollars, euros, Japanese yen and United Kingdom pounds sterling. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and
borrowing, and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear Bank conducts all operations for cross-border transactions, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts relating to international bonds,
equities, derivatives and investment funds are accounts with Euroclear Bank. Euroclear participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the
underwriters of the debt securities offered by this prospectus or one or more of their affiliates. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear participant,
either directly or indirectly. Euroclear Bank is an indirect DTC participant. The Euroclear Operator is a Belgian bank that is regulated by the Belgian Financial Services and Market Authority and the National Bank of Belgium. </P>

the &#147;Euroclear Terms and Conditions,&#148; govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear
are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Euroclear Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants and has no record of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Each of Clearstream and Euroclear will record the ownership interests of its participants in our debt securities, record transfers of those
securities and handle payments made and notices received with respect to such debt securities in much the same way as does DTC. If DTC is the depositary for the debt securities of a series, it will record the total ownership of any of the debt
securities of the U.S. agent of Clearstream or Euroclear as a participant in DTC. When debt securities are to be transferred from the account of a direct DTC participant to the account of a Clearstream or Euroclear participant, the purchaser must
send instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, through a Clearstream or Euroclear participant, as appropriate, at least one day prior to settlement. Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, will instruct its U.S. agent to
receive debt securities against payment. After settlement, Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, will credit its participant&#146;s account with the interest in the debt securities purchased. Credit for the debt securities will appear on the
next day (European time). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In instances in which the debt securities of a series are held by DTC or its nominee, settlement will take
place during New York business hours. Direct DTC participants will be able to employ their usual procedures for sending debt securities to the relevant U.S. agent acting for the benefit of Clearstream or Euroclear participants. The sale proceeds
will be available to the DTC seller on the settlement date. As a result, to the direct DTC participant, a cross-market transaction will settle no differently than a trade between two direct DTC participants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When a Clearstream or Euroclear participant wishes to transfer debt securities to a direct DTC participant, the seller will be required to
send instructions to Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, through a Clearstream or Euroclear participant, as appropriate, at least one business day prior to settlement. In these cases, Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be will
instruct its U.S. agent to transfer these debt securities against payment for them. The payment will then be reflected in the account of the Clearstream or Euroclear participant the following day, with the proceeds back-valued to the value date,
which would be the preceding day, when settlement occurs in New York. If settlement is not completed on the intended value date, that is, the trade fails, proceeds credited to the Clearstream or Euroclear participant&#146;s account will instead be
valued as of the actual settlement date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You should be aware that you will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the debt securities through Clearstream or Euroclear on the days when its system is open for business. Clearstream or Euroclear may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open
for business in the United States. In addition, because of time zone differences, problems may occur when completing transactions involving Clearstream or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. </P>

with respect to the debt securities of a series being offered and sold by means of this prospectus, electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links will be established among DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear to
facilitate the initial issuance of any of those debt securities sold outside of the United States and cross-market transfers of those debt securities associated with<B><U> </U></B>secondary market trading. DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have no

States holders of short-term debt securities are not required to include accrued discount in their income currently unless they elect to do so, but may be required to include stated interest in income as the income is received. United States holders

your purchase price for the foreign currency debt securities calculated in the foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i)&nbsp;the U.S. dollar value of the
principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the foreign currency debt securities and (ii)&nbsp;the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the foreign

circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of foreign currency debt securities to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If

Matters </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to facilitate the offering of the debt securities, an underwriter of the debt securities may engage in transactions
that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the debt securities or any other of our debt securities the prices of which may be used to determine payments on the debt securities. Specifically, an underwriter may over-allot debt
securities, that is, sell more debt securities than it is obligated to purchase, in connection with an offering of our debt securities, thereby creating a short position in those debt securities for its own account. In addition, to cover
over-allotments or to stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the debt securities or of any other debt securities at levels above those that might otherwise prevail, an underwriter may bid for, and purchase, the debt securities
or any other debt securities in the open market, including by entering stabilization bids, effecting syndicate covering transactions or imposing penalty bids. In any offering of the debt securities through a syndicate of underwriters, the
underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the debt securities in the offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed debt securities in transactions to cover syndicate
short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the debt securities above independent market levels or retard a decline in the market price of the debt securities.
These transactions may be effected on a securities exchange on which the debt securities are listed or admitted for trading, in the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">over-the-counter</FONT></FONT> market or otherwise.

second and tenth business day following the date of that prospectus supplement. For all but two of the underwritten offerings of debt securities we have made in the past several years, that date has been the fifth business day following the date of
the prospectus supplement relating to that offering of debt securities. Under Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15c6-1</FONT> of the SEC under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the settlement date is later than the second business day following the date of that prospectus supplement, any purchaser who wishes to trade the debt securities
on the date of the applicable prospectus supplement or on the subsequent days prior to the settlement date, will be required, by virtue of the fact that the sale of the debt securities initially will settle on such later business day, to specify an
alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. </P>

by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it

account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section&nbsp;9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in
this Section&nbsp;9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;9(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public

Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this Section&nbsp;9(d) to contribute
