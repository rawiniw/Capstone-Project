the Company, as Issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), as supplemented and amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December&nbsp;1, 2006, and the Second Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of December&nbsp;19, 2014, in each case, by and between the Company, as Issuer, and the Trustee (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of
the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which this Note is, and is to be, authenticated and delivered. The terms, conditions and
