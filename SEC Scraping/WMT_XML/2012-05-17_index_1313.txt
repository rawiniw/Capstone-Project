Dear Fellow Wal-Mart Shareholders:

On behalf of the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust and the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, we urge you to VOTE FOR PROPOSAL No. 5 at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s
annual meeting of shareholders on June 1, 2012. Our proposal asks the Wal-Mart
Board of Directors to adopt a policy that it will nominate at least one director
candidate with expertise in the field of health care, including significant
experience in patient safety and quality issues.

WAL-MART'S BOARD NEEDS QUALIFIED DIRECTORS TO AVOID RISKS FROM
HEALTH CARE COMPLIANCE FAILURES

-   Our resolution raises concerns about the Board's ability to prevent and
    Detect violations of federal health care law as it grows its health care
    business. Wal-Mart is diversifying from its traditional retail business mode
    into the provision of health care services, an evolution that creates new
    legal risks for the company, including risks related to the quality of
    patient care and compliance with federal and state regulations.

-   Wal-Mart's health care business is currently regulated by several federal
    health care laws including the False Claims Act (FCA) and the Health
    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA).  In 2004,
    Wal-Mart paid $2.9 million in fines for alleged violations of the FCA
    involving the false billing of prescription claims to Medicaid and other
   federal health insurance programs.  As part of the settlement, the company
   was required to report for four years to the federal government on
   improvements to its internal compliance controls related to its retail
   prescription services.

-  A series of joint publications by the Department of Health and Human
   Services, Office of the Inspector General and the American Health Lawyers
   Association emphasizes directors' fiduciary responsibilities to oversee both
   compliance and quality of care.

-  Wal-Mart's board should include a director who has experience managing these
  risks, to ensure that the board can fulfill its oversight duties in this area.

WAL-MART'S BOARD SHOULD REFLECT ITS GROWTH IN HEALTH CARE

-  Wal-Mart "Health and Wellness" business unit includes its fast-growing
   pharmacy and optical services.  The Humana Walmart-Preferred RX Plan is the
   fifth-largest prescription drug plan in the U.S.
   (http://www.drugchannles.net/2011/04/2011-part-d-maket-share-win-for-humana.
   html).

-  Wal-Mart employed more than 15,000 pharmacists in 2010, serving over 100
   million patients per week.
  (http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/career/2010/PharmacyCareer_
   Fall2010/LargeRetailers-Fall2010).

-  In a request for information issued by Wal-Mart in 2011, Wal-Mart stated that
   it "intends to build a national, integrated, low-cost primary healthcare
   platform that will provide preventative and chronic care services that are
   currently out of reach for millions of Americans"
   (http://media.npr.org/assetrs/blogs/health/images/2011/11/
   Walmarthealthpartnerships.pdf).

We therefore urge you to VOTE FOR PROPOSAL No. 5.

Sincerely,

Meredith Miller
Chief Corporate Governance Officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust

      THIS IS NOT A PROXY SOLICIATION AND NO PROXY CARDS WILL BE ACCEPTED
 Please execute and return your proxy card according to Wal-Mart's instructions
