<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target Corporation operates large-format general merchandise discount stores in the United States. As of April&nbsp;30, 2011, we
operated 1,755 stores in 49 states. We operate as three reportable segments: U.S. Retail; U.S. Credit Card; and Canadian. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
U.S. Retail Segment includes all of our merchandising operations, including our fully integrated online business. We offer both everyday essentials and fashionable, differentiated
merchandise at discounted prices. Our ability to deliver a shopping experience that is preferred by our customers, referred to as "guests," is supported by our strong supply chain and technology
infrastructure, a devotion to innovation that is ingrained in our organization and culture, and our disciplined approach to managing our current business and investing in future growth. As a component
of the U.S. Retail Segment, our online presence is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either online or by locating them in one of our stores with the aid of online research and
location tools. Our online shopping site offers similar merchandise categories to those found in our stores, excluding food items and household essentials. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
U.S. Credit Card Segment offers credit to qualified guests through our branded proprietary credit cards, the Target Visa Credit Card and the Target Credit Card. Additionally, we
offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, these REDcards&reg; help strengthen the bond with our guests, drive incremental sales and contribute to our results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2011, we entered into an agreement to purchase leasehold interests in up to 220 sites in Canada currently operated by Zellers&nbsp;Inc.
("<U>Zellers</U>"). We believe this transaction will allow us to open 100 to 150 Target stores in Canada, primarily during 2013. We are still in the process of evaluating each
location currently leased by Zellers. This transaction will allow us to deliver the Target brand shopping experience to our Canadian guests. As a result of this transaction, we began reporting a
Canadian segment in the first quarter 2011. </FONT></P>

securities contained in the accompanying prospectus and identifies any general terms and provisions described in the accompanying prospectus that will not apply to the notes. Certain terms used but

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fixed rate notes will be issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, and the floating rate notes will be
issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We will
issue the notes under an indenture, dated as of August&nbsp;4, 2000 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to Bank One Trust
Company, N.A.), as trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of May&nbsp;1, 2007 (the "<U>indenture</U>"). You should read the accompanying

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fixed rate notes will bear interest at a rate of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% per annum from July&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2011 or from the most
recent interest payment date on which we paid or provided for interest on the fixed rate notes. The interest payment dates for the fixed rate notes will be

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2012, a U.S. person that is an individual or estate, or a trust that does not
fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt from such tax, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the U.S. person's "net investment income" for the relevant taxable year and
(2)&nbsp;the excess of the U.S. person's "modified adjusted gross income" for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000,
depending on the individual's circumstances). A holder's "net investment income" will generally include its interest income and net capital gain from the disposition of the notes, unless such interest
income and net capital gain is derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). Net
investment income may, however, be reduced by properly allocable deductions to such income. U.S. persons that are individuals, estates or trusts are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
applicability of the Medicare tax to their income and gains from the notes. </FONT></P>

sold by the underwriters to the public initially will be offered at the public offering prices set forth on the cover of this prospectus supplement. Any notes sold by the
underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the applicable public offering price of up to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the principal amount of the fixed rate notes
and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of
the principal amount of the floating rate notes. Any such securities dealers may resell any notes purchased from the underwriters to certain other brokers or dealers at a discount from the applicable
public offering price of up to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the principal amount of the fixed rate notes and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the principal amount of the floating rate notes. If all the notes
are not sold at
the applicable public offering price, the underwriters may change such offering price and the other selling terms. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We have been advised by the underwriters that they intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue such market-making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases
to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions
consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because another
underwriter has repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stabilizing
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to each member state of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
"<U>Relevant Member State</U>"), each underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that
Relevant Member State (the "<U>Relevant Implementation Date</U>") it has not made and will not make an offer of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this
prospectus supplement to the public in that Relevant Member State other than: (i)&nbsp;to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive; (ii)&nbsp;to fewer

Directive. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This

Prospectus Directive, as implemented in that Relevant Member State, from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer
of the notes in that Relevant Member State may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us, our affiliates or any of the underwriters to publish a prospectus pursuant to the
Prospectus Directive for such offer. Neither we nor any of the underwriters have authorized, nor do we or they authorize, the making of any offer of the notes in circumstances in which an obligation

the purposes of this provision, the expression an "<U>offer of notes to the public</U>" in relation to any notes in any Relevant Member State means the
communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes,
as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State; "<U>Prospectus Directive</U>" means
Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the
Relevant Member State; and "<U>2010 PD Amending Directive</U>" means Directive 2010/73/EU. </FONT></P>

investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
may adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. </FONT></P>

business and investing in future growth. As a component of the Retail Segment, our online business strategy is designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly either online or by locating

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>  DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section describes the general terms and provisions of the debt securities. A prospectus supplement will describe the specific
terms of the debt securities offered through that prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this section that will not apply to those debt securities. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be issued under an indenture dated as of August&nbsp;4, 2000 between us and The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, National Association (successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of May&nbsp;1, 2007 and as
further amended or supplemented from time to time, referred to herein as the "<U>indenture</U>." As used in this prospectus, "<U>debt securities</U>" means
the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we issue and the trustee authenticates and delivers under the indenture. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have summarized the material terms and provisions of the indenture in this section. We have also filed the indenture as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part. You should read the indenture for additional information before you buy any debt securities. The summary
that follows includes references to section numbers of the indenture so that you can more easily locate these provisions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debt securities will be our direct, senior, unsecured obligations. The indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that
we may issue and permits us to issue debt securities from time to time. Debt securities issued under the indenture will be issued as part of a series that has been established by us under the
indenture. (Section&nbsp;301) Unless a prospectus supplement relating to debt securities states otherwise, the indenture and the terms of the debt securities will not contain any covenants designed
to afford holders of any debt securities protection in a highly leveraged or other transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the debt securities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
prospectus supplement relating to a series of debt securities being offered will include specific terms relating to the offering. (Section&nbsp;301) These terms will include some or

the debt
securities and exchange the debt securities at the office or agency maintained by us for that purpose. On the date of this prospectus, that office is located at c/o The Bank of New York Mellon,
101&nbsp;Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, Attn: Corporate Trust Window. We refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, acting in this capacity for the debt
securities, as the "<U>paying agent</U>." </FONT></P>

be returned to us and after that time any holder of a debt security can only look to us for the payments on the debt security. (Section&nbsp;1003) </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recipients of Payments.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paying agent will pay interest to the person in whose name the debt security is registered at the close of
business on
the applicable record date. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the "<U>record date</U>" means, for any interest payment date, the date 15
calendar days prior to that interest payment date, whether or not that day is a business day. However, upon maturity, redemption or repayment, the paying agent will pay any interest due to the person
to whom it pays the principal of the debt security. The paying agent will make the payment on the date of maturity, redemption or repayment, whether or not that date is an interest payment date. An
"<U>interest payment date</U>"means, for any debt security, a date on which, under the terms of that debt security, regularly scheduled interest is payable. </FONT></P>

The Depository Trust Company, referred to herein as "<U>DTC</U>," or any other depositary specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, as holder of book-entry
debt securities, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. We expect that the depositary, upon receipt of any payment, will immediately credit its participants' accounts in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the book-entry debt securities as shown on the records of the depositary. We also expect that payments by the depositary's
participants to owners of beneficial interests in the book-entry debt securities will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility
of those participants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
purposes of determining the amount of original issue discount that has accrued as of any date on which a redemption, repayment or acceleration of maturity occurs for a discount note,
original issue discount will be accrued using a constant yield method. The constant yield will be calculated using a 30-day month, 360-day year convention, a compounding period
that, except for the initial period (as defined below), corresponds to the shortest period between interest payment dates for the applicable discount note (with ratable accruals within a compounding
period), and an assumption that the maturity of a discount note will not be accelerated. If the period from the date of issue to the first interest payment date for a discount note (the
"<U>initial period</U>") is shorter than the compounding period for the discount note, a proportionate amount of the yield for an entire compounding period will be accrued. If
the initial period is longer than the compounding period, then the period will be divided into a regular compounding period and a short period with the short period being treated as provided in the
preceding sentence. The accrual of the applicable original issue discount discussed above may differ from the accrual of original issue discount for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be issued as fully-registered global securities which will be deposited with, or on behalf

the request of DTC, in the name of Cede&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting
on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in DTC. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their
customers. Investors may elect to hold their interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or (in Europe) through Clearstream or through Euroclear. Investors may hold
their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems. Interests held through
Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTC's books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear (the "U.S. Depositories"), which U.S. Depositories will, in turn,
hold interests on behalf of their participants' customers' securities accounts. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, beneficial interests in the global securities will
be held in denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Except as set forth below, the global securities may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of

interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on DTC's records, upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information. The underwriters or agents for the debt
securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by
standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in "street name," and will be the sole responsibility of those participants, and not
of DTC or its nominee, the trustee, any agent of ours, or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements. Book-entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a
physical note. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered
the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the debt securities. Owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled
to have debt securities registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders
of debt securities under the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of DTC and, if that person is not a DTC participant, on
the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form. These laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial owners may experience
delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to DTC and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owner's
account. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
understand that, under existing industry practices, if we request holders to take any action, or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action
which a holder is entitled to take under the indenture, then DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize
the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of time-zone differences, credits of debt securities received through Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during
subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such debt securities settled during such processing will
be reported to the relevant Euroclear Participants or Clearstream Participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of debt securities by or through a
Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash
account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the debt securities are cleared only through Euroclear and Clearstream (and not DTC), you will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments, deliveries,
transfers, exchanges, notices, and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for
business on days when banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their
interests in the securities through these systems and wish to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests, on a
particular day may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, U.S. investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on
a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. </FONT></P>

DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be modified or discontinued at any time. Neither we nor any paying agent will have any

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>  DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARES    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section describes the general terms and provisions of the depositary shares. The prospectus supplement will describe the specific
terms of the depositary shares offered through that prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this section that will not apply to those depositary shares. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have summarized the material terms and provisions of the deposit agreement, the depositary shares and the depositary receipts in this section. We have also filed the form of deposit
agreement, including the form of depositary receipt, as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. You should read the forms of deposit agreement and depositary
receipt relating to a series of preferred stock for additional information before you buy any depositary shares that represent preferred stock of that series. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may offer fractional interests in preferred stock, rather than full shares of preferred stock. If we do, we will provide for the
issuance by a depositary to the public of receipts for depositary shares, each of which will represent a fractional interest in a share of a particular series of preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
shares of any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares will be deposited under a separate deposit agreement between us and a bank or trust company having its
principal office in the United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50&nbsp;million, which we refer to in this prospectus as the "<U>depositary</U>."
We will name the depositary in the applicable prospectus supplement. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will have a fractional interest in all the rights
and preferences of the preferred stock underlying the depositary share. Those rights include any dividend, voting, redemption, conversion and liquidation rights. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued under the deposit agreement. If you purchase fractional interests in shares of the related series of preferred
stock, you will receive depositary receipts as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. While the final depositary receipts are being prepared, we may order the depositary to issue temporary
depositary receipts substantially identical to the final depositary receipts although not in final form. The holders of the temporary depositary receipts will be entitled to the same rights as if they
held the depositary receipts in final form. Holders of the temporary depositary receipts can exchange them for the final depositary receipts at our expense. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you surrender depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary, unless the related depositary shares have previously been called for redemption, you are entitled to
receive the number of shares of preferred stock and any money or other property represented by the depositary shares. We will not issue partial shares of preferred stock. If you deliver depositary
receipts evidencing a number of depositary shares that represent more than a whole number of shares of preferred stock, the depositary will issue you a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess
number of depositary shares at the same time that the shares of preferred stock are withdrawn. Holders of preferred stock received in exchange for depositary shares will no longer be entitled to
deposit those shares under the deposit agreement or to receive depositary shares in exchange for those shares of preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Dividends and Other Distributions  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received with respect to the preferred stock to the
record holders of depositary shares representing the
shares of preferred stock in proportion to the numbers of depositary shares owned by the holders on the relevant record date. The depositary will not distribute amounts less than one cent. The
depositary will distribute any balance with the next sum received for distribution to record holders of depositary shares. </FONT></P>

there is a distribution other than in cash, the depositary will distribute property to the holders of depositary shares, unless the depositary determines that it is not feasible to
make the distribution. If this occurs, the depositary may, with our approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of depositary shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
deposit agreement will also contain provisions relating to how any subscription or similar rights offered by us to holders of the preferred stock will be made available to the
holders of depositary shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Conversion and Exchange  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares is subject to conversion or exchange, the applicable prospectus
supplement will describe the rights or obligations of each record holder of depositary receipts to convert or exchange the depositary shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Redemption of Depositary Shares  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the series of the preferred stock underlying the depositary shares is subject to redemption, all or a part of the depositary shares
will be redeemed from the redemption proceeds of that series of the preferred stock held by the depositary. The depositary will mail notice of redemption between 30 to 60&nbsp;days prior to the date
fixed for redemption to the record holders of the depositary shares to be redeemed at their addresses appearing in the depositary's records. The redemption price per depositary share will bear the
same relationship to the redemption price per share of preferred stock that the depositary share bears to the underlying preferred stock. Whenever we redeem preferred stock held by the depositary, the
depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing the preferred stock redeemed. If less
than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or pro rata as determined by the depositary. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the date fixed for redemption, the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be outstanding. When the depositary shares are no longer outstanding, all rights of the
holders will cease, except the right to receive money or other property that the holders of the depositary shares were entitled to receive upon the redemption. Payments will be made when holders
surrender their depositary receipts to the depositary. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Voting the Preferred Stock  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the preferred stock may vote, the depositary will mail
information about the meeting contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary shares relating to the preferred stock. Each record holder of depositary shares on the record date, which
will be the same date as the record date for the preferred stock, will be entitled to instruct the depositary as to how the preferred stock underlying the holder's depositary shares should be voted. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
depositary will try, if practical, to vote the number of shares of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares according to the instructions received. We will agree to take all
action requested by and deemed necessary by the depositary in order to enable the depositary to vote the preferred stock in that manner. The depositary will not vote any preferred stock for which it
does not receive specific instructions from the holders of the depositary shares relating to such preferred stock. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Taxation  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of depositary shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as if they were owners of the preferred stock represented
by the depositary shares. Accordingly, for federal income tax </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section describes the general terms and provisions of the shares of our common stock. The prospectus supplement will describe the
specific terms of the common stock offered through that prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this section that will not apply to that common stock. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have summarized the material terms and provisions of the common stock in this section. We have also filed our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws as
exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. You should read our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws for additional information before you buy
any common stock. On September&nbsp;9, 2009, our board of directors approved certain amendments to our restated articles of incorporation, as amended. These amendments will become effective if
approved by holders of 75% of our outstanding voting shares at our 2010 annual shareholders' meeting. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shares Outstanding.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October&nbsp;31, 2009, our authorized common stock was 6,000,000,000 shares, of which 752,199,693
shares were issued and
outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividends.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of common stock may receive dividends if, when and as declared by our board of directors out of our funds
that we can legally use
to pay dividends. We may pay dividends in cash, stock or other property. In certain cases, holders of common stock may not receive dividends until we have satisfied our obligations to any holders of
outstanding preferred stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting Rights.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of common stock have the exclusive power to vote on all matters presented to our shareholders unless
Minnesota law or the
certificate of designation for an outstanding series of preferred stock gives the holders of that preferred stock the right to vote on certain matters. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one
vote per share. Holders of common stock may not cumulate their votes when voting for directors, which means that a holder cannot cast more than one vote per share for each director. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Rights.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business, holders of common stock will
receive pro rata,
according to shares held by them, any remaining assets distributable to our shareholders after we have provided for any liquidation preference for outstanding shares of preferred stock. When we issue
securities in the future, holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to buy any portion of those issued securities. Holders of our common stock have no rights to have their shares of common
stock redeemed by us or to convert their shares of common stock into shares of any other class of our capital stock. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our outstanding shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TGT." BNY Mellon
Shareholder Services
serves as the transfer agent and registrar for the common stock. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully Paid.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. This means the full purchase price for the
outstanding shares of
common stock has been paid and the holders of such shares will not be assessed any additional amounts for such shares. Any additional common stock that we may issue in the future pursuant to an
offering under this prospectus or upon the conversion or exercise of other securities offered under this prospectus will also be fully paid and nonassessable. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Anti-takeover Provisions Contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain provisions of our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, may make it less likely that our management would be changed
or someone would acquire voting control of our company without our board's consent. These provisions may delay, deter or prevent tender offers or takeover </FONT></P>

shareholder approval,
issue one or more new series of preferred stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval could discourage or make more difficult attempts to take control of our
company through a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Preferred stock with special voting rights or other features issued to persons favoring our management could stop a takeover by
preventing the person trying to take control of our company from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to take control. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classified Board.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of our board of directors are divided into three classes and serve staggered three-year terms under
Article&nbsp;VI of our restated articles of incorporation, as amended. This means that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected at each annual meeting of shareholders
and that it would take two years to replace a majority of the directors unless they are removed. Under Article&nbsp;VI of our restated articles of incorporation, as amended, directors can be removed
from office during their terms only if holders of at least 75% of our outstanding voting stock, voting together as one class, approve the removal. The holders of at least 75% of our outstanding voting
stock, voting together as one class, must approve any proposal to amend or repeal,
or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, this provision of our restated articles of incorporation, as amended. If approved by shareholders at our 2010 annual shareholders' meeting, the amendments

However, a shareholder
must follow the advance notice procedures described in Article&nbsp;VI of our restated articles of incorporation, as amended. In general, a shareholder must submit a written notice of the nomination
to our corporate secretary at least 60&nbsp;days before a scheduled meeting of our shareholders, together with the written consent of the nominee to serve as director. At least 75% of our
outstanding voting stock, voting together as one class, must approve any proposal to amend or repeal, or adopt any provisions inconsistent with, this provision of our restated articles of
incorporation, as amended. On September&nbsp;9, 2009, our board of directors adopted amended by laws that, among other things, changed the required period of advance notice of shareholder
nominations to at least 90&nbsp;days before the anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders. This new notice period will be effective following our 2010 annual shareholders'

in the proposal to our corporate secretary at least 90&nbsp;days before the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting of our shareholders. Shareholders seeking to have a proposal, other
than director nominations, considered for inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;14a-8 of the proxy rules under the federal securities

ownership and disposition of the debt securities offered by this prospectus. The material U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of common

1986, as amended (the "<U>Code</U>"), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ("<U>Treasury Regulations</U>"), administrative pronouncements of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service ("<U>IRS</U>") and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to change and to different interpretations. Changes to any
of the foregoing authorities could apply on a retroactive basis, and could affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. We will not seek a ruling from the IRS with respect to the
matters discussed in this section, and we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described below. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>This
discussion assumes that all debt securities will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as our indebtedness, and you should note that in the event of an alternative characterization,
the tax consequences would differ from those discussed below. This discussion does not address debt securities denominated or payable in a non-functional currency of an investor or debt
securities offered in bearer form. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, with respect to a particular offering of debt securities, the discussion below must be read with the discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may
appear in the applicable prospectus supplement for that offering. When we use the term "<U>holder</U>" in this section, we are referring to a beneficial holder of the debt
securities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used herein, a "<U>U.S. Holder</U>" is a beneficial owner of debt securities that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i)&nbsp;an individual citizen or
resident of the United States, (ii)&nbsp;a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii)&nbsp;an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or (iv)&nbsp;a trust
if (A)&nbsp;a United States court has the authority to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons (as defined under the Code) are authorized to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B)&nbsp;it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person. An individual may, subject to certain exceptions, be deemed to be a
resident of the United States by reason of being present in the United States for at least 31&nbsp;days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183&nbsp;days during a
three-year period ending in the current calendar year (counting for such purposes all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately
preceding year and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
"<U>Non-U.S. Holder</U>" is any beneficial owner of a debt security that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a U.S. Holder and that is not a
partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds debt securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership holding debt securities, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their own tax advisors with regard
to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the debt securities by the partnership. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE
DISCUSSION OF THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED TO
BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR PERSON. ACCORDINGLY, ALL PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND
NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments of Interest.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set forth below, interest on debt securities generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income from
domestic sources at the time that such interest is paid or accrued in accordance with the U.S. Holder's regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Issue Discount.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special tax accounting rules apply to debt securities issued with "original issue discount"
("<U>OID</U>") for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("<U>OID debt securities</U>"). In general, debt securities will be treated as issued with OID if the
"issue price" of the debt securities is less than their "stated redemption price at maturity" unless the amount of such difference is </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>de minimis</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (less
than 0.25% of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity). Regardless of the regular method of accounting used by a U.S. Holder for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, OID generally must be accrued into gross income on a constant yield basis, in advance of the receipt of some or all of the cash attributable to such OID. However, a U.S. Holder
generally will not be required to include separately in income cash payments received on OID debt securities, even if denominated as interest, to the extent those payments do not constitute "qualified
stated interest," as defined below. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
"<U>issue price</U>" of debt securities will be the initial offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold for cash
(ignoring sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The "<U>stated redemption price at
maturity</U>" of debt securities is the sum of all payments to be made on the debt securities other than "qualified stated interest" payments. A "<U>qualified stated
interest</U>" payment is stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property, other than debt securities of the issuer, at least annually at a single fixed rate
(appropriately taking into account the length of the interval between payments). See "&#151;Variable Rate Debt Securities" below for special rules for debt securities that provide for payments
of interest based on certain floating rates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
OID debt securities having a term of more than one year, the amount of OID includible in gross income by a U.S. Holder of the OID debt securities is the sum of the "daily portions"
of OID with respect to the OID debt securities for each day during the taxable year in which such U.S. Holder held the OID debt securities. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in
any "accrual period" a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to such accrual period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amount of OID allocable to any accrual period is generally equal to the excess (if any) of (i)&nbsp;the product of the "adjusted issue price" of the OID debt securities at the
beginning of such accrual period and the yield to maturity of the OID debt securities, as determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the
length of the accrual period, over (ii)&nbsp;the sum of any qualified stated interest payments allocable to the accrual period. For this purpose, accrual periods may be of any length and may vary in
length over the term of the OID debt securities provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs at the beginning or the end of
an accrual period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
adjusted issue price of OID debt securities at the start of any accrual period is equal to the issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period (determined
without regard to the amortization of any acquisition premium or bond premium, as described below), and reduced by any prior payments with respect to the OID debt securities that were not qualified
stated interest payments. The following rules apply to determine the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period: </FONT></P>

securities may contain provisions allowing the debt securities to be redeemed prior to their stated maturity date at our option or at the option of holders. For purposes of
determining yield and maturity, debt securities that may be redeemed prior to their stated maturity date at the option of the issuer generally will be treated from the time of issuance as having a
maturity date for U.S. federal income tax purposes on such redemption date if such redemption would result in a lower yield to maturity. Conversely, debt securities that may be redeemed prior to their
stated maturity date at the option of the holder generally will be treated from the time of issuance as having a maturity date for U.S. federal income tax purposes on such redemption date if such
redemption would result in a higher yield to
maturity. If the exercise of such an option does not occur, contrary to the assumptions made as of the issue date, then solely for purposes of the accrual of OID, the debt securities will be treated

Prospective investors of debt securities providing for contingent payments that do not constitute qualified stated interest should examine the applicable prospectus supplement and should consult their

their issue price and stated redemption price at maturity (unless the U.S. Holder elects to compute OID using tax basis instead of issue price). In general, U.S. Holders that use the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and certain other U.S. Holders are required to accrue OID in respect of short-term debt securities into gross income as ordinary income

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable Rate Debt Securities.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Regulations prescribe special rules for "variable rate debt instruments" that provide for the
payment of
interest based on certain floating or objective rates. In general, debt securities will qualify as variable rate debt instruments ("<U>variable rate debt securities</U>") if
(i)&nbsp;the issue price of the debt securities does not exceed the total non-contingent principal payments due in respect of the debt securities by more than an amount equal to the
lesser of (A)&nbsp;0.015 multiplied by the product of the total non-contingent principal payments and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date or (B)&nbsp;15% of
the total non-contingent principal payments, and (ii)&nbsp;the debt securities provide for stated interest, paid or compounded at least annually, at "current values" of (A)&nbsp;one or
more "qualified floating rates," (B)&nbsp;a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates, (C)&nbsp;a single "objective rate," or (D)&nbsp;a single fixed rate and a single objective
rate that is a "qualified inverse floating rate." A current value of a rate is the value of the rate on any date that is no earlier than three months prior to the first day on which that value is in
effect and no later than one year following that first day. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
"<U>qualified floating rate</U>" is any variable rate where variations in the value of such rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations
in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the variable rate debt securities are denominated. Although a multiple of a qualified floating rate generally will not itself constitute a
qualified floating rate, a variable rate equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple that is greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35 can constitute a qualified floating
rate. A variable rate equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple that is greater than 0.65 but not more than 1.35, increased or decreased by a fixed rate, will also
constitute a qualified floating rate. In addition, two or more qualified floating rates that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the term of the variable rate
debt securities (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>e.g.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, two or more qualified floating rates with values within 25 basis points of each other as determined on the issue date) will be
treated as a single qualified floating rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a variable rate that would otherwise constitute a qualified floating rate but which is subject to one or more restrictions
such as a maximum stated interest rate (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, a cap), a minimum stated interest rate (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, a floor) or
a restriction on the amount of increase or decrease in the stated interest (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, a governor) may, under certain circumstances, fail to be treated as a
qualified floating rate unless such restrictions are fixed throughout the term of the variable rate debt securities or are reasonably expected to not have a significant effect on the yield of the
variable rate debt securities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
"<U>objective rate</U>" is a rate that is not itself a qualified floating rate but which is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on
objective financial or economic information. A rate will not qualify as an objective rate if it is based on information that is within the control of the issuer (or a related party) or that is unique
to the circumstances of the issuer (or a related party), such as dividends, profits, or the value of the issuer's stock (although a rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely because it is
based on the credit quality of the issuer). An objective rate is a "qualified inverse floating rate" if the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate, as long as variations in the
rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate. The Treasury Regulations also provide that if debt securities provide for stated
interest at a fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating rate or an objective rate and if the variable rate on the issue date
is intended to </FONT></P>

the fixed rate (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>e.g.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the value of the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the value of the fixed rate by more than 25
basis points), then the fixed rate and the variable rate together will constitute either a single qualified floating rate or objective rate, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
variable rate debt securities provide for stated interest at either a single qualified floating rate or a single objective rate throughout their term, and such interest is
unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually, then all stated interest on such variable rate debt securities will constitute qualified
stated interest that is included in gross income by U.S. Holders as received or accrued in accordance with their regular methods of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, such variable
rate debt securities generally will not be treated as having been issued with OID unless the variable rate securities are sold at a discount from their stated principal amount, subject to a </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>de minimis</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
exception. In general, the amount of qualified stated interest and OID, if any, that accrues during an accrual period on such variable rate
debt securities is determined under the rules described above by assuming that the variable rate is a fixed rate equal to (i)&nbsp;in the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified inverse
floating rate, the value as of the issue date of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate, or (ii)&nbsp;in the case of an objective rate (other than a qualified inverse
floating rate), a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable rate debt securities. The qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period is increased (or
decreased) if the interest actually paid during an accrual period exceeds (or is less than) the interest that was accrued under the foregoing approach. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
other variable rate debt securities, the timing and amount of OID and qualified stated interest will be determined by converting the variable rate debt securities into "equivalent
fixed rate debt instruments." The conversion of the variable rate debt securities into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments generally involves substituting for any qualified floating rate or
qualified inverse floating rate a fixed rate equal to the value of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate, as the case may be, as of the issue date, or substituting for any
objective rate (other than a qualified inverse floating rate) a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable rate debt securities. In the case of variable rate debt
securities that provide for stated interest at a fixed rate in addition to either one or more qualified floating rates or a qualified inverse floating rate, the fixed rate is initially converted into
a qualified floating rate (or a qualified inverse floating rate, if the variable rate debt securities provide for a qualified inverse floating rate). Under such circumstances, the qualified floating
rate or qualified inverse floating rate that replaces the fixed rate must be such that the fair market value of the variable rate debt securities as of their issue date is approximately the
same as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for either the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate rather than the fixed rate. Subsequent
to converting the fixed rate into either a qualified floating rate or a qualified inverse rate, the variable rate debt securities are then converted into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments in the
manner described above. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
the variable rate debt securities are converted into equivalent fixed rate debt instruments pursuant to the foregoing rules, the timing and amount of OID and qualified stated
interest, if any, are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments by applying the general OID rules to the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments. A U.S. Holder of such variable rate
debt securities will account for OID and qualified stated interest as if the U.S. Holder held the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments. For each accrual period, appropriate adjustments will be made
to the amount of qualified stated interest or OID assumed to have been accrued or paid with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instruments in the event that such amounts differ from the actual
amount of interest accrued or paid on the variable rate debt securities during the accrual period. </FONT></P>

disposition of the debt securities, as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that has accrued on the debt securities (on a ratable basis or, at the election of the U.S. Holder, a
constant yield basis) but has not previously been included in gross income by the U.S. Holder. In addition, a U.S. Holder may be required to defer until the maturity of the debt securities, or their
earlier disposition in a taxable transaction, the deduction of all or a portion of any interest expense incurred on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry such debt securities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
U.S. Holder may elect to currently include market discount in gross income as it accrues, under either a ratable or constant yield method, in which case the rules described above
regarding characterization of payments and gain as ordinary income and the deferral of interest deductions will not apply. An election to currently include market discount in gross income, once made,

acquisition premium. For OID debt securities acquired with acquisition premium, the amount of OID that the U.S. Holder must include in gross income with respect to the OID debt securities for any
taxable year will be reduced by the portion of acquisition premium properly allocable to such taxable year. </FONT></P>

debt securities
after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest, the U.S. Holder will be considered to have purchased the debt securities at a "premium" for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In such case, the U.S. Holder generally may elect to amortize the premium over the remaining term of the debt securities, on a constant yield method, as an offset to interest includible in gross
income with respect to the debt securities, and the U.S. Holder would not be required to include OID, if any, in gross income in respect of the debt securities. In the case of debt securities that
provide for alternative payment schedules, the amount of premium generally is determined by assuming that a holder will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that maximizes the holder's yield,
and that the issuer will exercise or not exercise options in a manner that minimizes the holder's yield (although the issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise a call option in a manner that
maximizes the holder's yield). Any election to amortize premium would apply to all debt securities (other than debt securities the interest on which is excludable from gross income) held or
subsequently acquired by a U.S. Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and is irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Prospective investors should

it has received the IRS Form&nbsp;W-8EBN or other successor form from the beneficial owner or an intermediate financial institution and furnishes the paying agent with a copy. With
respect to debt securities held by a foreign partnership, unless the foreign partnership has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS, the foreign partnership generally will be required to

withholding tax discussed in the preceding paragraphs, will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on its effectively connected income, generally in the same manner as a U.S. Holder. See
"&#151;U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders" above. In lieu of the certificates described in the preceding paragraph, such a Non-U.S. Holder will be required to provide to
the paying agent a properly executed IRS Form&nbsp;W-8ECI or other successor form to claim an exemption from withholding tax with respect to its effectively connected interest income. In
addition, a Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty) on its earnings and profits

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>  EU DIRECTIVE ON THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS INCOME    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2005, a new European Union ("EU") Directive regarding the taxation of savings income became effective. The Directive
requires a Member State to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income payments made by a person within its jurisdiction for the
immediate benefit of an individual or to certain non-corporate entities resident in that other Member State (or for certain payments secured for their benefit). However, Austria, Belgium,
and Luxembourg have opted out of the reporting requirements and are instead applying a special withholding tax for a transitional period in relation to such payments of interest, deducting tax at
rates increasing over time to 35%. This transitional period began on July&nbsp;1, 2005 and will terminate at the end of the first fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU
countries regarding the exchange of information relating to those payments. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning
on July&nbsp;1, 2005, a number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories of Member States have adopted similar measures (either
provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments of interest or other similar income payments made by a person in that jurisdiction for the immediate benefit of an
individual or to certain non-corporate entities in any Member State. The Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional special withholding tax
arrangements with certain of
those dependent or associated territories. These apply in the same way to payments by persons in any Member State to individuals or certain non-corporate residents in those territories. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
additional amounts will be payable with respect to any of our securities if a payment on a security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is
required to be made pursuant to any European Union directive on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, any such directive.
Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the implications of the Directive in their particular circumstances. </FONT></P>

Any underwriters or agents will be identified, and their compensation, including any underwriting discount, will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. The prospectus supplement will

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

positions created by
short sales. Short sales involve the sale by underwriters of a greater number of securities than the underwriters are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain
bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the securities while the offering is in progress. </FONT></P>
