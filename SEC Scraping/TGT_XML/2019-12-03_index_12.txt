Shares held in the Target Stock Fund of the Target Corporation 401(k) Plan as of November 29, 2019, subject to earnings adjustments since the reporting person's last filing that have been reinvested in additional equivalent plan shares.
Deferred compensation units are held under the Target Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the Plan, participants' deferred compensation balances are indexed to various crediting rate alternatives, as chosen by them. The units reported relate to the Target common stock crediting rate alternative, and each unit is the economic equivalent of one share of Target common stock. The value of such units increases or decreases daily in accordance with an equivalent investment in the Target Stock Fund in the corporation's 401(k) plan. Participants are generally free to transfer plan balances into other crediting rate alternatives at any time. The Plan balances represent unsecured general obligations of Target Corporation, and are payable solely in cash.
The transaction represents the reporting person's discretionary disposition of units of the Target common stock crediting rate alternative under the Plan referenced in footnote 2, and is the economic equivalent of the sale of the same number of shares of Target common stock.
Includes units acquired as a result of reinvested dividends since the reporting person's Form 3 filing on 2/17/2016, that previously reported these deferred compensation units.
