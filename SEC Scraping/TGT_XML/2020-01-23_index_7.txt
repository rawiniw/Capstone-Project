Under the terms of the Plan, participants' deferred compensation balances are indexed to various crediting rate alternatives, as chosen by them. The units reported relate to the Target common stock crediting rate alternative, and each unit is the economic equivalent of one share of Target common stock. The value of such units increases or decreases daily in accordance with an equivalent investment in the Target Stock Fund in the corporation's 401(k) plan. Participants are generally free to transfer plan balances into other crediting rate alternatives at any time. The Plan balances represent unsecured general obligations of Target Corporation, and are payable solely in cash.

In addition, the price-vested stock options will become exercisable only if the closing price of Target's stock exceeds a hurdle of $75 for 20 consecutive trading days within the seven-year term.
