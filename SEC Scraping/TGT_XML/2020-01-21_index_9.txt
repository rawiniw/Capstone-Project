It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about January 28, 2020, which is the fifth business day following the date hereof (such settlement cycle being referred to as T+5). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to a trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+5, to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to the second business day before the delivery of the Notes should consult their own advisors.
