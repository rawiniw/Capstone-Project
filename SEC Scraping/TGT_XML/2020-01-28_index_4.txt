Underwriting Agreement
 

 
 
January 21, 2020
 
To the Representatives named in Schedule
I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Target Corporation, a Minnesota corporation
(the “Company”), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, to issue and sell to the Underwriters
named in Schedule II hereto (the “Underwriters”), the principal amount set forth in Schedule II
hereto of its debt securities identified on Schedule I hereto (the “Securities”), to be issued under
the indenture, dated as of August 4, 2000, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated as of May 1, 2007 and as further
amended or supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.) as Trustee (the “Trustee”). If the firm or
firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the
terms “Underwriters” and “Representatives” as used herein shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or
firms.
 
1.             The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:
 
(a)           An “automatic shelf registration statement” as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Act”), on Form S-3 (File No. 333-224749) in respect of the Securities has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) not earlier than three years prior to the date of this Agreement;
such registration statement, and any post-effective amendment thereto, became effective on filing; and no stop order suspending
the effectiveness of such registration statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has been
initiated or threatened by the Commission, and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of such registration statement
or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act has been received by the Company; the various
parts of such registration statement, including all exhibits thereto but excluding the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification
on Form T-1 and including any prospectus supplement relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under the Act and deemed by Rule 430B under the Act to be part of such registration statement, each as amended at
the time such part of the registration statement became effective, are hereinafter collectively called the “Registration
Statement”; the base prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement, in the form in which it was most recently
filed with the Commission prior to or on the date of this
 


 
 

 
Agreement, is hereinafter called the “Base Prospectus”;
the final prospectus supplement to such prospectus (including the Base Prospectus) relating to the Securities, in the form filed
or to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, is hereinafter called the “Prospectus”;
any preliminary prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus supplement) relating to the Securities, in the form filed or to
be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), is hereinafter called a “Preliminary Prospectus”; the
Base Prospectus, as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined in Section 1(f) hereof), including,
without limitation, any Preliminary Prospectus relating to the Securities, is hereinafter called the “Statutory Prospectus”;
any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus
or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein that were filed under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or the Act, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, on or before the date of this Agreement or the issue date of any such prospectus;
any reference to “amend”, “amendment”, “supplement” or similar terms with respect to the Registration
Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer
to and include any documents filed under the Exchange Act or the Act, as the case may be, after the date of this Agreement or the
issue date of any such prospectus which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein; and any “issuer free writing
prospectus” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) relating to the Securities that (i) is required to be filed with the Commission
by the Company or (ii) is exempt from filing pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) because it contains a description of the Securities
or the offering that does not reflect the final terms is hereinafter called an “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus”;
 
(b)          The
documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus (including, without
limitation, the interactive data in eXtensible Business Reporting Language included or incorporated by reference therein), when
they were filed with the Commission or became effective, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements
of the Exchange Act or the Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; none of such documents
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement, the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus (including, without limitation, the interactive data in eXtensible Business
Reporting Language included or incorporated by reference therein), when such documents are filed with the Commission or become
effective, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Act, as applicable,
and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided,
however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made therein in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly
for use therein;
 

2
 


 
(c)           No order suspending or preventing the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus has been issued by the Commission;
 
(d)           The Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Statutory Prospectus conform, and the Prospectus and any
post-effective amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus will conform, in all material respects
to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”),
and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and (i) the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, as of
their applicable effective dates relating to the Securities, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii)
any Preliminary Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of their issue
dates, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (iii) the Prospectus
and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, if applicable, at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof), will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that this representation
and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein;
 
(e)           The Company has been, and continues to be, a “well-known seasoned issuer” (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Act), and has not been, and continues not to be, an “ineligible issuer” (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under
the Act), in each case as from the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering
participant made a “bona fide” offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) under the Act) of the Securities;
 
(f)            As used herein, the “General Disclosure Package” means, collectively, (i) the Statutory Prospectus, (ii)
the Final Term Sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof and (iii) any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that
is identified on Schedule III hereto; and the “Applicable Time” means 3:30 p.m. (New York City time)
on the date of this Agreement. The General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, did not include any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus identified on Schedule III hereto does
not conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus; provided,
however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to statements or omissions made therein in reliance upon and
in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for
use therein;
 


3
 

 
(g)           The Company has not made, and, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, will not make, any offer relating
to the Securities that would constitute an “issuer free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act)
required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act; provided,
however, that the prior written consent of the Representatives shall be deemed to have been given with respect to the Issuer
Free Writing Prospectuses identified on Schedule III hereto; and the Company has complied, and will comply, with the requirements
of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the

registered public accounting firm as required by the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board.
 
For purposes of this Section 1, as well as for Section 7 hereof,
references to the “General
 


7
 

 
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus” are to each of the General Disclosure Package and
the Prospectus as separate or stand-alone documentation (and not the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus taken together),
so that representations, warranties, agreements, conditions and legal opinions will be made, given or measured independently in
respect of each of the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
2.             Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each of the Underwriters,
and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price set forth in
Schedule I hereto the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule II
hereto.
 
3.             Upon the authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Securities, the several Underwriters propose to offer
the Securities for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
4.             (a) The Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter hereunder will be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the
Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price
therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds, at the office of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York 10017, at 9:30 a.m. (New York City time) on January 28, 2020, or at such other time and date as the Representatives
and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the “Time of Delivery.” The
Securities will be delivered by the Company to the Representatives in the form of global Securities, representing all of the Securities,
which will be deposited by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, with The Depository Trust Company, or its nominee,
for credit to the respective accounts of the Underwriters.
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that it and each of its affiliates have complied, and will comply, with
the selling restrictions applicable to offers and sales of Securities in jurisdictions outside the United States as set forth in
Schedule V hereto. In the event that the offer or sale of the Securities by an Underwriter in a jurisdiction outside the
United States requires any action on the part of the Company in or with respect to such jurisdiction, such Underwriter represents
and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that, with respect to requirements as to which the Company or such Underwriter becomes
aware, it will (i) inform the Company that the Company is required to take such action prior to the time such action is required
to be taken and (ii) cooperate with and assist the Company in complying with such requirements. Each Underwriter, on behalf of
itself and each of its affiliates, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company that it
and each such affiliate have not offered, sold, purchased or delivered, and will not offer, sell, purchase or deliver, directly
or indirectly, any of the Securities or distribute any offering material in relation thereto in any jurisdiction outside the United
States except under circumstances that will, to the best of its or such affiliate’s knowledge, result in compliance with
the applicable laws and regulations thereof.
 
(c) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and the Representatives that it has not made, and unless it obtains the

or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading,
or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under

Company, Rule 158);
 
(e)           During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the later of (i) the date on which the

them to pass upon such matters;
 
(c)           Don
H. Liu, Esq., Executive Vice President, Chief Legal & Risk Officer and Corporate Secretary of the Company, or another of the
Company’s counsel satisfactory to the Representatives, shall have furnished to the Representatives his or her written opinion,
dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that:
 
(i)            The
Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Minnesota,
with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the General Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus;
 
(ii)           The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under
the laws of each other jurisdiction where, in light of the nature of the business transacted or the property owned by it, such
qualification is necessary and the failure so to qualify might in such counsel’s opinion permanently impair title to property
material to its operations or its right to enforce a material contract against others or expose it to substantial liabilities in
such jurisdiction (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause (ii) upon opinions of local counsel
and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company; provided that such counsel shall state that
such counsel believes that both the Representatives and such counsel are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates);
 
(iii)          Each subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business
and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction where, in light of the nature of the business transacted or the
property owned by it, such qualification is necessary and the failure so to qualify might in such counsel’s opinion permanently
impair title to property material to its operations or its right to enforce a material contract against others or expose it to
substantial liabilities in such jurisdiction (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause (iii)
upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries;
provided that such counsel shall state that such counsel believes that both the Representatives and such counsel are justified
in relying upon such opinions and certificates);
 
(iv)          All
of the issued shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are
fully paid and non-assessable (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in this clause (iv) upon opinions
of local counsel and in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries; provided
that such
 


13
 

 
counsel shall state that such counsel believes that both the Representatives and such counsel are justified in relying
upon such opinions and certificates);
 
(v)           To the best of such counsel’s actual knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject,
other than as set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and other than litigation or governmental proceedings
which, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and to the best
of such counsel’s actual knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened
by others;
 
(vi)          The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the
Indenture and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein and herein contemplated will not result in a breach
of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge
or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject;
 
(vii)         The documents incorporated by reference in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus or any amendment thereto prior to
the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as to which such counsel need express
no opinion), as of the date when they were filed with the Commission or became effective, as the case may be, complied as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of
the Commission thereunder; and such counsel does not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed
as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus
or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus which are not filed or
incorporated by reference or described as required; and
 
(viii)        Such
counsel has no reason to believe that any of the documents incorporated by reference in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus
or any amendment thereto prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules therein, as
to which such counsel need express no opinion or belief), when they were so filed or became effective, as the case may be, contained
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements
 


14
 

 
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
 
(d)           Faegre Baker Daniels LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated

provided by the Indenture, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, reorganization,
assignment for the benefit of creditors and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights
and to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except
further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments
outside the United States; and the Securities and the Indenture conform to the descriptions thereof in the General Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus;
 
(v)           Each of the Original Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Company. The Indenture constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company enforceable against the Company in

assignment for the benefit of creditors and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights
and to general equity principles (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement
thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making of payments outside the United
States; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
 


15
 

 
(vi)          The issue and sale of the Securities, the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture
and this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not result in a breach of any
of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance
upon any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or other document
filed or incorporated by reference by the Company as an exhibit to its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any subsequent
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K (provided that no opinion is rendered regarding breaches or defaults
contained in any other instrument or agreement), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation applicable
to the Company of which we have actual knowledge of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties (“Applicable Law”);
 
(vii)         No
consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is
required under Applicable Law for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act
and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue
Sky laws or FINRA laws or regulations in connection with the purchase and/or distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters;
 
(viii)        The
Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities in accordance with this Agreement and the application
of the proceeds as described in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption
 “Use of Proceeds,” will not be an “investment company” or an entity “controlled” by an “investment

by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and

in the Registration
 


16
 

 
Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (other than as set forth in paragraph (iv) of this
Section 8(d)), such counsel has no reason to believe that (A) as of its applicable effective dates relating to the Securities,
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the Time of Delivery contained an untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, (B) as of the Applicable Time, the General Disclosure Package contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not

the Prospectus; and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the General
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock (other than issuances of common
stock pursuant to stock option and other compensatory plans and arrangements adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company,
issuances of common stock upon conversions of convertible preferred stock and repurchases of common stock by the Company under
its stock buy-back programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors) or any increase in consolidated long-term debt
(excluding capital leases and commercial paper backed by long-term credit facilities, existing debt discount accretion and increases
solely due to the provisions of ASC 815 relating to interest rate swaps) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or a change,
or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders’
investment or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated
in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii),
is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 


17
 

 
(g)           On or after the date of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material

adverse change in financial, political or economic conditions in or affecting the United States or a disruption in commercial
banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States, if the effect of any such event specified in

with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company’s debt securities or preferred stock, the effect of

Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
(i)            The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses

8.             (a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages

or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus,
any Preliminary Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, the General Disclosure Package, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)           Promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the
case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a)
or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying
party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall
wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to
such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party),
and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified
 


19
 

 
party, in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified
party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened
action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party
is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as
to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement
is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability
by reason of such settlement.
 
(d)           If
the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to
therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If,
however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified
party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also
the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed
to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear
to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the
cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on
the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were
treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to
 


20
 

 
the public
exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
Underwriters’ obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations
and not joint.
 
(e)           The
obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and
shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the
Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters
may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9.            (a)           If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder,
the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities
on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange
for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to
procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event
that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged
for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such
Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than
seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus,
or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus which in the Representatives’ opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term “Underwriter”
as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally
been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)          If,
after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased
does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to
require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase
hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount
of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters
for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its
default.
 


21
 

 
(c)          If
after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the
Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities
of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any
non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided
in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting
Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
10.           The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several
Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain
in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of
any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person
of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
11.           If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to
any Underwriter except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but if for any other reason the Securities are not delivered
by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for
all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably
incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall
then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.
 
12.           The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including
the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm’s-length
commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (b) in connection
with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is, and has been, acting solely
as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company directly or indirectly, (c) no Underwriter has assumed, or will
assume, an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the
process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters)
and no Underwriter has any similar obligation to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby
except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged
in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and (e) the Underwriters have not
provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby, and the Company has
consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
 


22
 

 
13.           In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be
entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives
jointly or by any of the Representatives and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized
by such Underwriter.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the
USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name
and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow  the underwriters to properly identify
their respective clients.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements
hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient
in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth
on Schedule I hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by registered mail
to Target Corporation, 33 S 6th Street, CC1125, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, Attention: Treasurer.
 
14.           Recognition of U.S. Special Resolution Regimes.
 
(a)           In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer from such Underwriter of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation in or under this Agreement, will
be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement,
and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
 
(b)           In the event that any Underwriter that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate of such Underwriter becomes subject to
a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be exercised against such Underwriter
are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if this Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
 
“BHC Act Affiliate” has the meaning
assigned to the term “affiliate” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. § 1841(k).

following:
 

(i)a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b);
 

(ii)a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b);
or
 

(iii)a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).
 


23
 

 
“Default Right” has the meaning
assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.
 
“U.S. Special Resolution Regime”
means each of (i) the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) Title II of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
 
15.           This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent
provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any
Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or
have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed
a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
16.           Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term “business day” shall mean any
day when the Commission’s office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
17.           This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.           This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
 
19.           Each of the parties hereto hereby waives any right to trial by jury in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement.

FORM OF COMFORT LETTER
 
Pursuant to Section 7(e) of the Underwriting
Agreement, the accountants shall furnish a “comfort” letter or letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
 
(i)            They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning
of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board;
 
(ii)           In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules examined by them and
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related
published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro
forma financial information and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for
the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the Representatives;
 
(iii)          In their opinion, the unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and
financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus
and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal
year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement, where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements
for such fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such
fiscal years;
 
(iv)          On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest
available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its
subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Statutory Prospectus
and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters
and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to
believe that:

consolidated statements of changes in financial position included or incorporated by reference in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(B)           any
other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus do not agree
with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and
any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding
amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(C)           the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus but from which
were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and
balance sheet items included in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on
a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(D)           any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Statutory
Prospectus and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of
the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical
amounts in the compilation of those statements;
 
(E)            as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, when compared with amounts shown in the
latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Statutory Prospectus and the Prospectus, there has been:

·[any decrease in net consolidated working capital greater than 2.5% of the Company’s most recent fiscal year-end
total consolidated assets (treating all commercial paper as a current liability)]*; or
 

·[any decrease in consolidated shareholders’ investment greater than 0.5% of the Company’s most recent fiscal

May 1, 2007, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and as further amended or supplemented
from time to time (herein called the “Indenture”) (in its capacity as trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., being herein called the “Trustee,” which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture),
to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon
which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face
hereof, such series being limited in initial aggregate principal amount to $750,000,000; provided, however, that the Company
may, without the consent of the Holders of the Securities of this series, issue additional Securities with the same terms as the

Securities of this series.
 
This Security is issuable
only in registered form in denominations of $2,000 or any amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.
 
The Securities of this
series shall not be entitled to any sinking fund.
 
Optional Redemption
 
The Securities of this
series are redeemable on at least 10 days’, but no more than 45 days’, prior written notice mailed (or otherwise delivered
in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC) to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed, either in whole at any time
or in part from time to time prior to November 15, 2029 (three months prior to the Stated Maturity of the Securities of this series,
the “Par Call Date”), at a Redemption Price for the Securities to be redeemed on any Redemption Date equal to

on that Redemption Date matured on the Par Call Date (excluding interest accrued to the Redemption Date), discounted to the Redemption
Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a discount rate equal to the Treasury
Rate, plus 10 basis points;
 
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest on the Securities being redeemed to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
Any redemption of the
Securities of this series may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. Any related
written notice of redemption will describe the conditions precedent and, at the Company’s discretion, will indicate that
any Redemption Date may be delayed or the written notice rescinded if all such conditions precedent shall not have been satisfied
or waived by the Company.
 
“Treasury
Rate” means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity
or interpolated yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue.  In determining this rate, the price for the Comparable
Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) shall be assumed to be equal to the Comparable Treasury Price
for such Redemption Date.
 
“Comparable
Treasury Issue” means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual
or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized,
at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities
of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
 
“Independent
Investment Banker” means any of BofA Securities, Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,
or their respective successors as may be appointed from time to time by the Quotation Agent after consultation with the Company;
provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York
City (a “primary treasury dealer”), another primary treasury dealer shall be substituted therefor by the Company.
 
“Comparable
Treasury Price” means (A) the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption
Date after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer
than three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption
Date.
 


 6 
 

 
“Reference
Treasury Dealer Quotations” means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the arithmetic
average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each
case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 3:30 p.m.
(New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
“Reference
Treasury Dealer” means each of BofA Securities, Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,
or their respective successors and any other primary treasury dealer selected by the Quotation Agent after consultation with the
Company.
 
“Remaining
Scheduled Payments” means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal
and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that,
if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest
payment thereon shall be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
 
“Quotation
Agent” means, for purposes of determining the Redemption Price, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or such other primary treasury
dealer as may be selected by the Company.
 
In addition, the Company
may redeem all or part of the Securities of this series, on at least 10 days’, but no more than 45 days’, prior written
notice mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC) to each Holder of the Securities to
be redeemed, at any time or from time to time on and after the Par Call Date, at the Company’s option, at a Redemption Price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities being
redeemed to, but excluding, the Redemption Date.
 
A partial redemption
of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide
for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of the Securities of this series equal to an authorized denomination.
 
For the avoidance of
doubt, notice of any redemption shall be mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC) at
least 10 days but not more than 45 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
 
Unless the Company
defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the Securities
of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.

Change of Control Offer

be required to make an offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of the Securities of this series to
repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that Holder’s Securities
on the terms set forth herein. In a Change of Control Offer, the Company shall be required to offer the Change of Control Payment.

but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, a notice shall be mailed
to Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control
Triggering Event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date shall be no earlier
than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a “Change of Control Payment Date”).
The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the Change of Control Offer
is conditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
In order to accept
the Change of Control Offer, the Holder must deliver to the Paying Agent, at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date, this Security together with the form entitled “Election Form” (which form is annexed hereto) duly completed,
or a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth:
 
(i)       the
name of the Holder of this Security;
 
(ii)      the
principal amount of this Security;
 
(iii)     the
principal amount of this Security to be repurchased;
 
(iv)     the
certificate number or a description of the tenor and terms of this Security;
 
(v)      a
statement that the Holder is accepting the Change of Control Offer; and
 
(vi)     a guarantee
that this Security, together with the form entitled “Election Form” duly completed, will be received by the Paying
Agent at least five Business Days prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
Any exercise by a Holder of its election
to accept the Change of Control Offer shall be irrevocable. The Change of Control Offer may be accepted for less than the entire
principal amount of this Security, but in that event the principal amount of this Security remaining outstanding after repurchase
must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

On the Change of Control
Payment Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful:

together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series or portions of
such Securities being repurchased.
 
The Company shall not
be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes
such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and
the third party purchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company
shall not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date
an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment upon a Change of
Control Triggering Event.
 
The Company shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the
provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities of
this series, the Company shall comply with those securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We
have acted as counsel for Target Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the
preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-224749) (the “Registration Statement”)
of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), relating to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of the
securities referred to therein, and the Prospectus Supplement dated January 21, 2020 to the
Prospectus dated May 8, 2018 (the “Prospectus”) relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the
Registration Statement of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.350%
Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of August 4, 2000
entered into by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A.),
as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 1, 2007 (as so supplemented, the “Indenture”),
and sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 21, 2020 between the Company and the Underwriters named therein
(the “Underwriting Agreement”). 
 
We have examined such
documents, records, and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
 
Based on and subject
to the foregoing and the qualifications that follow, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and duly executed
and, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant
to the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium,
reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’
rights and to general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and except further as enforcement

thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits, delays or prohibits the making
of payments outside the United States.
 
We have relied as to
certain relevant facts upon certificates of officers of the Company as to the accuracy of such factual matters and upon representations
of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement without independent verification thereof or other investigation. We have also relied,
without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient
legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question and to carry out their role in
the transaction; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Company) has satisfied those legal
requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii)
each party to or having rights under agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Company) has complied with all legal
requirements pertaining to its status (such as legal investment laws, foreign qualification statutes and business activity reporting
requirements, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Section 290.371)
as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted
to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy
conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual
mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; (vi) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions,
and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to
lawyers practicing in Minnesota; (vii) the conduct of the parties to or having rights under any instrument or agreement relevant
hereto has complied with any requirement of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability; and (viii) all relevant statutes,
rules, regulations or agency actions are constitutional and valid unless a reported decision in the opining jurisdictions has specifically
addressed but not resolved, or has established, its unconstitutionality or invalidity.
 
Without limiting any
other qualifications set forth herein, the opinion expressed herein regarding the enforceability of the Notes is subject to the
effect of generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material
change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver; (ii) limit
the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected; (iii) limit the enforceability
of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its
own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful
conduct; (iv) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the
contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange; (v) govern and
afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys’ fees and other costs; (vi) may
permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either
permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important
under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract; (vii) may limit
the enforceability

 of provisions for the payment of premiums upon mandatory prepayment to the extent any such payment constitutes,
or is deemed to constitute, a penalty or forfeiture; (viii) may require mitigation of damages; and (ix) provide a time limitation
after which a remedy may not be enforced (i.e., statutes of limitation).
 
The opinion herein
expressed is limited to the specific issues addressed and to facts and law existing on the date hereof. We express no opinion as
to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Minnesota. In addition, we express no opinion as to whether,
or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation,
the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes.
 
We hereby consent to
the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and to being named in the Prospectus included therein under the caption
 “Legal Opinions” with respect to matters stated therein. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are
in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
 


 
Very truly yours,
