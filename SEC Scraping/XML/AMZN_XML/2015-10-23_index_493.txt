settlement in connection with specified actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation &#150; a &#147;derivative action&#148;), if they acted in
good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. A similar
standard is applicable in the case of derivative actions, except that indemnification only extends to expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such actions, and the statute requires court
approval before there can be any indemnification in which the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation. The statute provides that it is not exclusive of other indemnification that may be granted by a corporation&#146;s

indemnification for all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys&#146; fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by any person in connection with any
actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving as a director or officer of the Company or that, being or having been a director or

respect to awards granted under the Plan to residents of the state of California, the terms set forth in this Addendum shall apply to such awards. All capitalized terms used in this Addendum but not otherwise defined shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Plan. For clarity, the interpretation and construction of the provisions of this Addendum by the Board of Directors shall be final and conclusive. The Board of Directors may correct any defect or supply any omission or
reconcile any inconsistency in the Addendum in the manner and to the extent it deems expedient to carry the Addendum into effect, and the Board of Directors shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. </P>

except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of the optionee&#146;s domicile at the time of death, and (b)&nbsp;during the optionee&#146;s lifetime, shall be exercisable only by the optionee; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may permit a Non-Statutory Stock Option to be transferable to a revocable trust or by gift or domestic relations order to a family member of the optionee. For purposes of this Addendum, the term &#147;family member&#148;

respect to the award. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if an optionee&#146;s employment or service with the

termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only if and to the extent the optionee was entitled to exercise the option at the date of termination; <I>provided, however</I>, that the Board of Directors may not provide for a post-termination
exercise period that ends before the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the expiration of 6 months after the date of termination or (b)&nbsp;the expiration date of the option. </P>

the date of death and only by the person or persons to whom the optionee&#146;s rights under the option shall pass by the optionee&#146;s will or by the laws of descent and distribution of the state or country of domicile at the time of death;

months of that date by a majority of the then outstanding securities entitled to vote. No option granted under the Plan was exercised, and no shares were awarded under Section&nbsp;7 or 8 of the Plan, before such security holder approval was
obtained. All options shall be granted, if at all, by August&nbsp;2, 2016. All awards granted pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 or 8 of the Plan shall be granted, if at all, by August&nbsp;2, 2016. </P>

Such amendments shall be approved by a majority of the outstanding securities entitled to vote within 12 months after such date. Any option granted to any person in California that is exercised before such security holder approval is obtained (and
any award granted pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 or 8 of the Plan before such approval is obtained) must be rescinded if security holder approval is not obtained in the manner described in the preceding sentence. The shares issued upon any such exercise
(and any such shares awarded pursuant to Section&nbsp;7 or 8 of the Plan) shall not be counted in determining whether such approval is obtained. </P>

Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided that for purposes of determining such compliance, any registered domestic partner shall be considered a &#147;family member&#148; as that term is defined in Rule 701. </P>
