is probable, reasonably possible, or remote. A conclusion that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated results in an accrual, which is reviewed by the Principal Accounting Officer before it is recorded. A conclusion that a loss (or an
additional loss) is reasonably possible results in a determination of whether the amount of the possible loss or range of loss is known, reasonably estimable or not reasonably estimable. Although such determinations are made on a case by case basis,
in the context of patent litigation, if the plaintiff&#146;s and the Company&#146;s damages experts have testified as to a range of damages, we generally conclude that a range of loss is reasonably estimable. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As part of our quarterly close process, Tax and Accounting team members review and evaluate our existing and new uncertain tax positions,
including those related to transfer pricing. They consider all relevant facts and circumstances including communications from tax authorities, statutes of limitations, relevant court cases, existing legislation and other information. In addition,
for purposes of meeting the disclosure requirements of ASC 740-10-50-15d, they evaluate whether it is reasonably possible that the total amount of income tax contingencies will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the relevant
reporting date. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Since the 2006 establishment of our European headquarters, we have consistently disclosed that transfer
pricing is a significant component of our tax contingencies. In our 2006 10-K, we disclosed that we transferred assets from the U.S. to other countries with the establishment of our European headquarters, which may result in transfer pricing
exposure. Specifically, in Note 12, &#147;Income Taxes,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our 2006 10-K (page 71), we stated, &#147;Associated with the establishment of our European headquarters, we transferred certain of our
operating assets in 2005 and 2006 from the U.S. to international locations. These transfers resulted in taxable income and exposure </FONT></P>

to additional taxable income assertions by taxing jurisdictions.&#148; Additionally, in each 10-K from 2006 to 2010, we consistently disclosed that transfer pricing is a primary component of our
tax contingencies. For example, in Note 5, &#147;Other Long-Term Liabilities,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our 2006 10-K (page 63), we said, &#147;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has provided tax reserves of
approximately $75 million for U.S. and foreign income taxes, which primarily relate to restructuring of certain foreign operations and intercompany pricing between our subsidiaries.&#148; And in Note 5, &#147;Long Term Liabilities,&#148; to our
consolidated financial statements in our 2010 10-K (page 54) we disclosed that our tax reserves for tax contingencies &#147;primarily relate to transfer pricing, state income taxes, and research and development credits.&#148; </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The IRS audited our transfer pricing relating to our 2005 and 2006 federal tax returns through an examination which principally took
place between 2007 and 2010. On December&nbsp;22, 2010, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#147;NOPA&#148;) from the IRS that proposed an adjustment to a portion of our transfer pricing. The NOPA was not material and represented
approximately 3% of the $1.5 billion in potential federal tax expense contingencies that we subsequently disclosed. On November&nbsp;4, 2010, we received a draft valuation report from consultants hired by the IRS, which included a valuation of
assets transferred as part of the establishment of our European headquarters, and the IRS asked us to comment on the report. Representatives from the Company, the IRS, and the consultant met several times between November 2010 and January 2011 to
discuss, among other things, this report. On January&nbsp;27, 2011, we received the final valuation report from the consultant, which revised and modified the November 2010 draft but retained the same valuation. On March&nbsp;15, 2011, we received a
second NOPA which relied on the consultants&#146; final January report and which, together with the first NOPA, resulted in our disclosure of the approximate $1.5 billion potential federal income tax expense impact. This second NOPA was our first
official notification from the IRS regarding its preliminary position on the potential incremental transfer pricing impact. Even NOPAs, however, are proposed adjustments that are preliminary in nature and subject to negotiation and change until the
IRS examination team issues the Revenue Agent&#146;s Report at the conclusion of the audit. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Based on our interpretation of
the relevant regulations and case law, including a recently-issued, taxpayer-favorable tax court decision that provides further support to our analysis (see <I>Veritas Software Corporation v. Commissioner, 2009 U.S. Tax Ct. LEXIS</I> 34, 133 T.C.
No.&nbsp;14 (Dec. 10, 2009)), we disagree with the two transfer pricing NOPAs. Accordingly, we intend to vigorously contest these two NOPAs, and to pursue all available administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. However, because of the
amounts involved in the second NOPA, we disclosed in our First Quarter 2011 10-Q that these NOPAs proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income, which would result in additional federal tax expense over a seven year period beginning in 2005
totaling approximately $1.5 billion, subject to interest (see Note 6, &#147;Income Taxes,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our First Quarter 2011 10-Q (page 10)). </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our reserves for income tax contingencies at December&nbsp;31, 2009 of $181 million, at December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $213 million, and at
March&nbsp;31, 2011 of $218 million, represent management&#146;s best judgment given the facts, circumstances, and information available at the time. As we state in Note 1, &#147;Description of Business and Accounting Policies &#150; Income
Taxes,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our 2010 10-K (page 45), &#147;We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized </FONT></P>

upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast
actual outcomes.&#148; Further, as we state in our Note 9, &#147;Income Taxes,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our 2010 10-K (page 63), &#147;These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve
provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.&#148; We believe that our existing reserves for income tax contingencies, which include amounts related to transfer pricing, among other tax contingencies, but are less than the
amounts proposed by the IRS in these two transfer pricing NOPAs, represent adjustments that are more than 50% likely of being realized. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

to our consolidated financial statements in our First Quarter 2011 10-Q (page 10), pursuant to ASC 740-10-50-15d: &#147;Changes in state and federal tax laws or tax assessments may impact our tax contingencies. It is reasonably possible that within
the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities. These assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
