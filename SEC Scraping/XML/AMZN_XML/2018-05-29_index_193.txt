<body style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif" bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">
<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">Dear fellow Amazon shareholder:</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">In advance of our annual meeting this week when we will vote for directors of the company, I would like to raise a critical issue in the HQ2 selection process and the criteria being used to evaluate the location for Amazon&#8217;s new home. &#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">As the No Gay? No Way! Campaign has reported, nine of the states currently under consideration have failed to address a glaring deficit&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;the lack of comprehensive legal protections for Amazon&#8217;s LGBTQ employees, customers, and their families. The states are Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Because Amazon has a strong history and reputation as an ally to the LGBTQ community, these states should not be considered by the company unless they change their outdated and discriminatory policies. Selecting a state where LGBTQ employees, their families, customers, and partners can face legal discrimination is tantamount to condoning discrimination. This will hurt employee recruitment, lower LGBTQ retention rates, diminish Amazon&#8217;s ability to attract the most creative and innovative workforce, and pose significant risk to Amazon&#8217;s market value.&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">And while some of the cities vying for HQ2 have touted their local policies and LGBTQ-friendly environments, corporate and municipal protections are not sufficient nor a substitute for statewide comprehensive legal protections. In many instances state legislatures have pre-empted positive policies passed at the local level with anti-LBGTQ policies at the state level. Cities matter, but in the area of protecting our employees and their families, states matter more.</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">Instead of sending a negative signal to the LGBTQ community, Amazon has a tremendous opportunity to use the HQ2 selection process to reaffirm their commitment. Locating HQ2 in a state with robust LGBTQ protections will send a strong signal to Amazon&#8217;s employees and customers that not only does the company truly value diversity, it is willing to publicly back that commitment up with action. And as many studies have shown, it&#8217;s not just the right thing to do, it&#8217;s good for business.</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</div>

<div style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; COLOR: #000000; TEXT-ALIGN: left">As we prepare for the election of directors, I am asking that the Board of Directors affirm their support for statewide comprehensive non-discrimination legal protections for LGBTQ people, and publicly commit to making full non-discrimination protections a part of the HQ2 search criteria.&#160;</div>
