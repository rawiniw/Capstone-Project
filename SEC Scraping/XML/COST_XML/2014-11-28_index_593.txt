Executive during the six (6)&nbsp;month period following the Termination Date does not qualify within either of the foregoing exceptions and constitutes deferred compensation subject to the
requirements of section 409A of the Code, then such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the &#147;Excess Amount.&#148; If at the time of Executive&#146;s separation from service, the Company&#146;s (or any entity required to be aggregated
with the Company under section 409A of the Code) stock is publicly-traded on an established securities market or otherwise and Executive is a &#147;specified employee&#148; (as defined in section 409A of the Code and determined in the sole
discretion of the Company (or any successor thereto) in accordance with the Company&#146;s (or any successor thereto) &#147;specified employee&#148; determination policy), then the Company shall postpone the commencement of the payment of the
portion of the Excess Amount that is payable within the six (6)&nbsp;month period following the Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto) for six (6)&nbsp;months following the Termination Date with the Company (or any successor
thereto). The delayed Excess Amount shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive within ten (10)&nbsp;days following the date that is six (6)&nbsp;months following the Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto). If Executive dies
during such six (6)&nbsp;month period and prior to the payment of the portion of the Excess Amount that is required to be delayed on account of section 409A of the Code, such Excess Amount shall be paid to the personal representative of
Executive&#146;s estate within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after Executive&#146;s death. The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with section 409A of the
Code and makes no undertaking to preclude section 409A of the Code from applying to any such payment or benefit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c)

or Executive&#146;s employment shall be fully and finally settled by confidential arbitration in Seattle, Washington, before a single arbitrator. Judgment on an award issued by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator shall be chosen (i)&nbsp;by agreement of the parties and need not be affiliated with any particular organization, but (ii)&nbsp;absent agreement of the parties, the arbitrator shall be appointed by Judicial Dispute Resolution
(&#147;JDR&#148;) in Seattle, Washington, and if JDR is unable to do so, by Judicial Arbitration&nbsp;&amp; Mediation Services, in Seattle, Washington. Absent agreement of the parties to the contrary, discovery and motion practice in the arbitration
shall be governed by the Washington Civil Rules and the Local&nbsp;Rules of King County Superior Court, with the understanding that the arbitrator may, at his or her discretion, limit the extent and scope of discovery, and determine the
permissibility of pre-hearing dispositive motions. The arbitrator shall fully and finally determine any and all questions of arbitrability. Confidentiality of the arbitration is at the request of, and for the benefit of, both parties. The Company
shall be responsible for payment of any and all costs and arbitrator fees of such arbitration. Either party shall have the right to seek emergency injunctive relief in court in aid of arbitration to preserve the status quo pending determination of
the merits in arbitration. Venue and jurisdiction for any such action for injunctive relief shall exist exclusively in state and federal courts in King County, Washington. </P>

subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. References to Sections are to references to Sections of this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to a provision of a statute, rule or
