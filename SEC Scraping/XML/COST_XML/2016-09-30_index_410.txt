<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;26, 2016, the Board of Directors of Costco Wholesale Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) amended the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated
Bylaws (the &#147;Bylaws&#148;) to implement proxy access. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the Company&#146;s 2016 annual meeting, a non-binding shareholder proposal was approved,
which requested that the Board provide for proxy access. Thereafter, the Board continued its analysis of proxy access design and developments in the adoption of proxy access by other companies, and sought feedback on proposed terms from a number of
its largest shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;2.12 of the Bylaws has been added to permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20&nbsp;shareholders, owning
3%&nbsp;or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in the Company&#146;s proxy materials directors constituting up to the greater of two directors and 20%&nbsp;of the Board
of Directors, provided that the requirements specified in the Bylaws are satisfied. These requirements are consistent with those adopted by numerous other companies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amendments also include updating changes to the Bylaws regarding advance notice of nominations or business to be presented at the annual meeting, and make
other ministerial, clarifying, and conforming changes. The amendments to the Bylaws are effective immediately, except that the amendments to Section&nbsp;2.1 and new Section&nbsp;2.13 as it applies to Section&nbsp;2.1 will be effective as of
November&nbsp;1, 2016. Proxy access will first apply with respect to the Company&#146;s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This description of the
amendments to the Bylaws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;3.2 to this Form&nbsp;8-K. </P>
