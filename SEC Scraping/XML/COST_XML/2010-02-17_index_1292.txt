important driver of increasing profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth. Comparable sales growth is achieved through a combination of increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each
visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes
in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales not associated with currency fluctuations the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and</U>

administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right
merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe the Company has repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States.
Adverse economic conditions negatively impacted spending by our customers during 2009, and we expect that negative impact to continue in 2010. Sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread,
including other warehouse clubs, discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, and supermarkets, as well as internet retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe
that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to
focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our &#147;pricing authority&#148; &#150; consistently providing the most competitive values. This may
cause us, for example, at certain times to absorb increases in merchandise costs rather than immediately passing them along to our members.</U> </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:8%"><FONT

the United Kingdom and Korea, weakened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted net income for 2009 by approximately $83 after-tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. Additionally, net income for 2009 was negatively impacted by a $34 pre-tax

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;The following discussion generally applies to compensation for all Named Executive Officers. Based largely on historical practices of the Company, the components of our compensation programs are
base salary, a discretionary cash-bonus program, equity compensation (since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 consisting solely of awards of RSUs), and other benefits (primarily consisting of health plans, a 401(k) plan and a deferred compensation
plan) and perquisites. Executive base salaries and cash bonuses are, in the Committee&#146;s view, low compared to the other companies in our peer group, and the Company places great emphasis in the compensation packages for the Named Executive
Officers on equity incentive compensation. The Committee did not extensively reevaluate this year whether there is an optimal mix of equity, salary, bonus and other compensation components. Rather, it relied upon the fact that the current structure
has been utilized successfully in years past and gave more particular attention to the incremental changes in the components of the mix and the value of the total compensation packages.&#148; </FONT></P> <P

relatively low salaries and cash bonuses compared to its peer companies). Accordingly, the amount of the cash bonuses is small relative to total cash compensation and total compensation. There are five executive officers covered in the compensation
tables for whom the metrics in question are directly pertinent. Using total compensation values from the summary compensation table for fiscal 2009, the percentages of bonus paid to total compensation were: DiCerchio 1.7%; Galanti 1.1%; Jelinek

subcomponents that inform the amount of the cash bonuses is material, because no single metric would account for more than half of the bonus potential and most account for only around 10%. As disclosed on page 14 of the proxy statement, the cash
bonus amounts are a function of at least five different categories of metrics. In addition to an internal income target, which accounts for roughly 50% of the bonus potential, the bonus for fiscal year 2009 was determined &#147;based on goals
relevant to the executive officer&#146;s area of responsibility: for those whose responsibilities are operational, the goals related to sales, controllable expenses, inventory shrinkage, and pretax profit in their areas of responsibility; for those
whose responsibilities are primarily buying, the goals related to sales, gross margin, inventory shrinkage, and inventory turns in their areas of responsibility; for those whose responsibilities combine operational and buying functions, the goals
related to a combination of those described above; and for those whose responsibilities are staff functions, the goals related to a combination of Company-wide operational and buying goals, in addition to qualitative factors relevant to their areas
of responsibilities.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition to the small portion each individual subcomponent plays in the overall bonus program,

half&#148; (half, that is, if the maximum amount of the component is awarded) of the bonus is based upon a company income target, which alone among the metrics is the same for all the officers in question. Beyond that, there is a great variation
among the metrics applied, for two primary reasons: for those with responsibilities across the entire Company geographically (DiCerchio, Galanti, and Jelinek), metrics are company wide; for those with geographically focused responsibilities, the
metrics are regionally based (Portera, based on one data set for Canada and another for

that are department focused. And there is a solely qualitative element of the bonus for each executive that has no associated metrics. Thus, apart from the Company income target and the non-quantitative component, there are a more than twenty
different metrics that can influence the cash bonuses for these five officers, the most significant of which accounted for no more than $12,950 in fiscal 2009. Clearly, no one of these can be deemed material to an investor&#146;s understanding of
the Company&#146;s compensation policies and decisions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Further evidence of the immateriality of any individual metric of the
cash bonus plan is the discretionary nature of the program.&nbsp;As noted on page 14 of the proxy statement, the cash bonus payments are &#147;discretionary&#148; and are reported as such in the bonus column of the Summary Compensation
Table.&nbsp;The discretion exists at two levels.&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal, the CEO, makes the initial determination as to the amount of the cash bonuses he wishes to recommend to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.&nbsp;The
Compensation Committee maintains discretion to vary from Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal&#146;s recommendation, although it rarely exercises that discretion.&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal determines the recommended amount of the cash bonuses after a discretionary and
subjective evaluation of company and executive officer performance in specified areas identified at the beginning of the fiscal year.&nbsp;He is not bound to recommend the payment any specific amount based on achievement of any pre-established
formulas.&nbsp;For example, as noted there was an income target in fiscal 2009 that was not met.&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Sinegal nevertheless had the discretion to recommend to the Compensation Committee the full amount of the potential cash bonus associated
with this target (known as the Company half), to award some fraction (not necessarily in proportionate fashion), or none at all.&nbsp;He chose in this particular year to award none at all.&nbsp;In addition, as noted above a substantial component of
the cash bonuses lacks any quantitative framework. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Based on the foregoing, we believe that it is appropriate for the Company
