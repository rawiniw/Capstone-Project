style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">(a)  On February 7, 2014, the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) approved amendments to the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &#8220;Bylaws&#8221;).  The amendments took effect immediately upon approval by the Board.  The amendments address the following Bylaw provisions:</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"></font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Special Meetings (Article II, Section 3)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The amendments give shareholders owning at least 10% of the voting power of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares the right to request a special meeting of shareholders.  The amendments provide that for this purpose a shareholder is considered to own only those shares for which the shareholder has full voting rights and a full economic interest.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The amendments also establish the procedures for shareholders to request a special meeting, including that the Secretary of the Company will call the special meeting and require the same information that must be provided pursuant to the advance notice procedures in the Bylaws (discussed below) when a shareholder submits matters for consideration at a meeting of shareholders.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The amendments state that a special meeting called by the Secretary must be held no more than 90 days after the Secretary receives a request, unless a longer period is required to allow the Company to file information required under Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) rules.  In order to prevent duplicative meetings, the amendments also provide that the Secretary is not required to call a special meeting if a request is received during the period beginning 90&#160;days before the first anniversary of the prior year&#8217;s annual meeting of shareholders and ending 30&#160;days after the most recent annual meeting.  In addition to their pre-existing authority to call special meetings directly, the amendments also provide that the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President may request that the Secretary call a special meeting of shareholders.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">Advance Notice Procedures (Article II, Section 5)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The amendments update the advance notice procedures in the Bylaws, which govern the process by which shareholders can nominate directors and propose other business for consideration at meetings of shareholders.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Among other things, the amendments:  (a) make minor changes to the advance notice deadlines for annual meetings to link the deadlines to the date of the prior (rather than the current) year&#8217;s annual meeting; (b) add advance notice deadlines for special meetings of shareholders and for certain other situations, such as where the date of the annual meeting changes significantly from the prior year; (c)&#160;require additional specificity in a shareholder&#8217;s notice about nominations and other business that the shareholder intends to propose for consideration at a meeting; (d) require information in the notice about Company shares held by certain affiliates and associates of the shareholder and about derivative or other transactions involving shares held by these parties or by the shareholder; (e) require a shareholder submitting a notice to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose a nomination or other business; (f) give the Company explicit authority to request additional information about director nominees for which notice is given using the advance notice process; (g) clarify that various aspects of the advance notice procedures apply to both annual and special meetings; and (h) make additional clarifying or conforming changes and immaterial language changes.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As a result of the amendments, if any shareholder intends to nominate a director candidate or propose other business for consideration at the Company&#8217;s 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (not including a proposal intended for inclusion in the Company&#8217;s proxy statement in accordance with the SEC&#8217;s Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the shareholder must notify the Secretary of the Company in writing and the notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company no earlier than February 27, 2014 and no later than March 24, 2014.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board were to accept all of the offers of resignation then pending, resulting in the Corporation having fewer than three directors who were in office before the election, the Board may determine to extend such 90-day period by an additional 90 days upon the conclusion that such an extension is in the best interests of the Corporation. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:8px;text-align:left;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">(d) If any director&#8217;s resignation offer is not accepted by the Board, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until the director&#8217;s earlier death, resignation, or removal.
