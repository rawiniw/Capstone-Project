Dear Wal-Mart, Inc. Shareholder:

We wish the recent critiques of Wal-Mart's pay practices and the
recommendations against this year's Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive
Officer Compensation would have prompted the board to reflect on whether it
is properly aligning executive pay to company performance. Instead, the
board has chosen to respond with a defense of its practices that, upon
examination, fails to provide any new or exculpatory information:

  - The board argues that its pay is closely aligned with performance, but
    cannot rebut the finding that, over the past three years, Wal-Mart's
    target CEO pay has ranked at the 72nd percentile of its Equilar peer
    group, while its total shareholder return ranks at the 22nd percentile.

  - The board asserts incorrectly that Institutional Shareholder Services
    acknowledges that "Wal-Mart's CEO pay is low relative to the median of
    its peers." In fact, current CEO McMillon's $26.8 million in total
    compensation for FY 2014 is 2.5 times the median for the peer group
    selected by Wal-Mart, and about 1.5 times the ISS selected peer group.

  - The board argues that its short-term and long-term performance payouts were
    below the targeted payouts for executives this year. But as we have noted,
    these payouts are:

    - LARGE IN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND RELATIVE TO SALARY.  Former CEO Duke received
      an annual cash incentive payout of $2.8 million, more than twice his
      salary.  Current CEO McMillon received a bonus of over $1 million, over
      100% of his salary.

    - DISPROPORTIONATE TO PERFORMANCE, in that they provide a much larger
      percentage of the targeted award than the percentage of targeted
      performance achieved. Mr. Duke's cash incentive payout represented 64% of
      his targeted bonus, despite the company achieving only 23% of targeted
      performance. Mr. McMillon received a bonus equal to 54% of its targeted
      level, despite achievement of only 23% and 24% of the two targeted
      performance metrics.

    - SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN IF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE CALCULATED IN
      GAAP TERMS RATHER THAN WITH MULTIPLE ADJUSTMENTS.  For FY2014, the sole
      metric for Mr. Duke's bonus, Total Company Operating Income, FELL 3.3%
      measured in GAAP terms, but INCREASED 1% with the board-approved
      adjustments. Mr. McMillon's targeted performance included one other
      measure, International Operating Income, which FELL 17.6% in GAAP terms
      but ROSE 2.2% as adjusted by the board.

  - The board acknowledges that it has persistently lowered the targets and
    thresholds for the Return on Investment metric used in its Performance
    Shares plan.  Nevertheless, it insists that this repeated shifting of the
    goal posts does not mean that the goals it sets for executives are not
    demanding. The board seems to believe that the point of such programs is
    to ensure that executives enjoy a handsome payout, regardless of
    performance; we disagree. We believe that steadily declining ROI indicates
    a challenge, and that the board should incentivize executives to rise to
    this challenge. If instead executives can expect performance goals to be
    lowered year after year, we worry that Wal-Mart's long-standing decline
    in ROI will not be reversed.

  - The board suggests that the $50 billion increase in the company's market
    capitalization over the past five fiscal years indicates that "shareholders
    believe in our strategies." However, as the company's own 10K reveals,
    Wal-Mart's share price growth over the last five fiscal years has
    significantly lagged both the S&P 500 Retail Index and the S&P 500 overall.

  - The board argues that the adjustments it makes to various performance
    measures are appropriate in order to avoid disincentivizing sound long-term
    decisions that have negative consequences for short-term performance.
    However, in our view this potential conflict between the short- and
    long-term is precisely why companies have multiple components to their
    executive compensation programs: so that executives can be confident that
    difficult short-term decisions will be rewarded in the long run.
    Consequently, adjustments to performance measures that reflect decisions
    over which executives have significant control should be unnecessary.
    Moreover, while the net effect of these


           1900 L Street, NW, Suite 900 Washington, DC   20036
                              202-721-6060
                      www.ctwinvestment group.com

    adjustments is not always to improve on GAAP-measured performance, they did
    have this performance-boosting effect in five of the last seven fiscal
    years, including the past two years, for Total Company Operating Income
    growth and International Operating Income growth. For US Operating Income
    growth, the adjusted performance is higher than GAAP performance for each
    of the past six fiscal years.

  - The board provides no defense for adjusting its sales measure for its
    Performance Shares program to reflect reductions in federal SNAP benefits,
    which we assume indicates that the board realizes such adjustments are
    indefensible.

  - The board fails altogether to justify its additional grants of between $1
    million and $2.5 million in restricted stock to executives "for retention
    purposes" despite these executives having already received between $12.8
    million and $25.6 million in restricted stock grants over the past three
    years. We note that according to Wal-Mart's proxy statement (pg. 73),
    termination of an executive's employment for reasons other than death or
    disability would result in the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock, so
    these large recent grants seem to provide a more than adequate retention
    incentive.  Moreover, one of these executives was only hired in 2012, and
    another promoted to her current position in 2012, making it hard to
    understand why the recent CEO transition would require a special equity
    grant to retain their services.

  - We believe that a creative, evidenced-based approach to human capital
    management, including but not limited to the level and design of executive
    compensation, is both consistent with the Compensation, Nominating, and
    Governance Committee's charter, and in the best interests of long-term
    shareholders.

We hope that the board will reconsider its response and make appropriate changes
to its executive pay program in the near future. Until then, for all of the
reasons listed above, we urge you to vote AGAINST Proposal No. 3 - Advisory Vote
to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation at Wal-Mart, Inc.'s annual
meeting on June 6, 2014.

Sincerely,

/s/

Dieter Waizenegger
Executive Director, CtW Investment Group
