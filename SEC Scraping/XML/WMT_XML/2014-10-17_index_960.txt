other several underwriters named in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement (as defined below) (the &#147;Underwriters&#148;), have entered into a Pricing Agreement, dated October&nbsp;7, 2014 (the &#147;Pricing Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, the Company has agreed to sell to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters have agreed to purchase from the Company, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company&#146;s 3.300%
Notes Due 2024 (the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Pricing Agreement incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of an Underwriting Agreement, dated October&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2014 (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;), between the Company and the
