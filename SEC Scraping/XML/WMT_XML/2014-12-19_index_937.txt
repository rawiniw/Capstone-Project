bear interest during each relevant interest period at the rate determined as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and as otherwise set forth below. Each floating rate debt security will have an interest rate basis or formula. Unless
otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will base that formula on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or &#147;LIBOR,&#148; for the LIBOR currency. The term &#147;LIBOR currency&#148; means the currency specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement as to which LIBOR will be calculated or, if no such currency is specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, U.S. dollars. In the applicable prospectus supplement, we will indicate any spread or spread
multiplier to be applied in the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate applicable in any interest period. A spread or spread multiplier may cause the interest rate applicable to a particular series of floating rate debt securities to
be higher or lower than the applicable LIBOR for a particular interest period. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days during the relevant interest period and a 360-day year. </FONT></P>

immediately preceding business day. If the maturity date of such debt securities (or a tax or other redemption date, if earlier than the stated maturity date for those debt securities) falls on a day which is not a business day, then we will make
the required payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest or redemption price on the next succeeding business day, as if it were made on the date the payment was due. Interest will not accrue on, from or after the stated maturity date (or any

next succeeding business day, unless that day is in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case the interest reset date will be the immediately preceding business day. The interest rate set for the debt securities on a particular interest
reset date will remain in effect during the interest period commencing on that interest reset date. Each interest period will be the period from and including the interest reset date to but excluding the next interest reset date or until the

remedied or waived and all payments due with respect to the debt securities of that series, other than those becoming due as a result of acceleration, have been made. (Section 7.02) If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the
debt securities of a series, the trustee may, in its discretion, and will, at the written request of holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series and upon reasonable indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request and subject to certain other conditions set forth in the indenture, proceed to protect the rights of the holders of the debt securities of that series.
(Sections 7.03 and 7.12) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of that series may waive any past default under the indenture and its consequences except an uncured default in the payment of principal of and
premium, if any, or interest on those debt securities or with respect to any covenant or provision of the indenture that the indenture or the debt securities specifically provide cannot be waived without the consent of each holder of debt securities

debt securities of that series, the whole amount then due and payable on the debt securities of that series for principal, premium, if any, and interest. The indenture also provides that if we fail to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, the

premium, if any, or interest on any of the debt securities of that series, the trustee will be protected in withholding that notice if the trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of that notice is in the interest of the holders of the

advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a &#147;banking organization&#148; within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#147;clearing
corporation&#148; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a &#147;clearing agency&#148; registered pursuant to the provisions of Section&nbsp;17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities that DTC&#146;s participating
organizations, referred to as &#147;direct DTC participants,&#148; deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the clearance and post-trade settlement among direct DTC participants of sales and other securities transactions, such as transfers and
pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in direct DTC participants&#146; accounts at DTC, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct DTC participants include both
U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers (including underwriters of our debt securities), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of which, and/or their representatives, indirectly own DTC. DTC is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation, or &#147;DTTC,&#148; which is the holding company for the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, and the Emerging Markets
Clearing Corporation, each of which is a registered clearing organization. The users of DTTC&#146;s regulated subsidiaries&#146; services own DTTC. Indirect access to the DTC system is also available to others, referred to as &#147;indirect DTC
participants&#148; and together with direct DTC participants, referred to as &#147;DTC participants,&#148; such as U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a direct DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and the DTC participants are on file with the SEC. According to DTC, the foregoing information with respect to DTC has been provided to
the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind. </FONT></P>

registered in the name of DTC or the nominee of DTC will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global note will be made only through, records maintained by DTC and DTC participants. When you purchase such debt securities, the
purchases must be made by or through a direct DTC participant, which will receive credit for the debt securities in its account on DTC&#146;s records. Upon that purchase, you will become the beneficial owner of the purchased debt securities. If you
purchase through a direct DTC participant, your interest will be recorded on the records of the direct DTC participant. If you purchase through an indirect DTC participant, your interest will be recorded on the records of the indirect DTC
participant, while the direct DTC participant through which the purchase is effected will reflect ownership of those debt securities in the account it maintain maintains for the indirect DTC participant. Neither DTC nor we will have any knowledge of
your individual ownership of the debt securities. When you purchase debt securities through the DTC system, you will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from DTC. You should instead
receive these confirmations and account statements from the DTC participant through which you purchase the debt securities. The DTC participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers, including, if you are a
customer of such DTC participant, any beneficial interests you may hold in our debt securities. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The trustee and we will treat
the person in whose name a global note representing our debt securities is registered, whether DTC or its nominee, as the owner of such global note for all purposes. Accordingly, the trustee will pay all amounts payable with respect to such debt
securities to the registered holder of such global note. It is DTC&#146;s current practice, upon receipt of any payment of distributions or liquidation amounts due on a global note, to proportionately credit direct DTC participants&#146; accounts on
the payment date based on their holdings of the relevant securities. Payments to you with respect to your beneficial interest in any debt securities in turn will be the responsibility of the DTC participants based on their respective customary
practices, and the trustee, any paying agent and we will have no direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due on a global note to you or any other beneficial owners in that global note. We or, at our request, the trustee will send any
redemption notices regarding debt securities directly to DTC, which in turn will inform the DTC participants, which will then contact you as a beneficial holder. DTC&#146;s current practice is to pass through any consent or voting rights to the
direct DTC participants by using an omnibus proxy. Those direct DTC participants should, in turn, solicit votes and consents from you, as the ultimate owner of debt securities, either directly or through the indirect DTC participant through which
you hold the debt securities, or provide you with a proxy based on their respective customary practices. As a general proposition, we understand that under existing industry practices, if we request the holders of our debt securities to take, or if
a beneficial owner of our debt securities wants to take, any action that a holder of such debt securities is entitled to take under the indenture, DTC would authorize the direct DTC participants holding the relevant beneficial interests in such debt
securities to take that action. The DTC participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through them to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding our debt securities through such DTC
participants. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under applicable rules, regulations and procedures, DTC must make book-entry transfers of our debt securities
represented by global notes registered in the name of DTC or its nominee between direct DTC participants and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of, premium, if any, on, interest on and the redemption price for such debt securities.
Those DTC participants with which investors have accounts to which such debt securities are credited must make similar book-entry transfers and receive and transmit payments on behalf of their respective customers. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Because DTC can only act on behalf of direct DTC participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect DTC participants and certain banks,
the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a security held in DTC to transfer or pledge that interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of that interest, may be
affected by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest. The laws of some states of the United States require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form in order to transfer or perfect a security
interest in those securities. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a security held in DTC to those persons or to perfect such a security interest may be limited. </FONT></P>

connection with the offering, thereby creating a short position in the debt securities for its own account. In addition, to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the debt securities or of any other debt securities, an underwriter may
bid for, and purchase, the debt securities or any other debt securities in the open market. In any offering of the debt securities through a syndicate of underwriters, the underwriting syndicate may reclaim selling concessions allowed to an
underwriter or a dealer for distributing the debt securities in the offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed debt securities in transactions to cover syndicate short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of
these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the debt securities above independent market levels or retard a decline in the market price of the debt securities. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities, and
may end any of these activities at any time. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>Market for Debt Securities </B></FONT></P>

securities we have made in the recent past, that date has been the fifth business day following the date of the prospectus supplement relating to that offering of debt securities. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the SEC under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, if the settlement date is later than the third business day following the date of that prospectus
supplement, any purchaser who wishes to trade the debt securities on the date of the applicable prospectus supplement or on the subsequent days prior to the settlement date, will be required, by virtue of the fact that the sale of the debt
securities initially will settle on such later business day, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. </FONT></P>

(referred to in the following standard provisions as this &#147;Agreement&#148;) that provides for the sale of certain of its debt securities of one or more series (referred to in the following standard provisions as the &#147;Securities&#148;) to
the several underwriters that are named in such underwriting agreement (referred to in the following standard provisions as the &#147;Underwriters&#148;). The underwriting agreement to be entered into by the Company and the underwriters in
connection with any particular underwritten offering of debt securities by the Company that will be made in reliance on the Registration Statement on Form S-3 to which this Exhibit 1.1 is an exhibit (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) will
include terms and conditions substantially in the form of the standard provisions set forth below, subject to such changes in such standard provisions that the Company and the representatives of the underwriters entering into that underwriting
agreement agree to make. Such underwriting agreement will be incorporated by reference into a pricing agreement to be entered into by the Company and the several underwriters (referred to in the following standard provisions as the &#147;Pricing
Agreement&#148;) with respect to the purchase by the underwriters of the debt securities of the Company specified in such pricing agreement (referred to in the following standard provisions as the &#147;Designated Securities&#148;). Each such
pricing agreement will generally be in the form set forth as Annex I to the standard provisions set forth below, subject to such changes from such form that the Company and the representatives of the underwriters entering into that pricing agreement
agree to make. The Company anticipates that, in connection with each offering of its debt securities made in reliance on the Registration Statement, the Company will file the underwriting agreement and the pricing agreement that it enters into with
underwriters in connection with such underwritten offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission by means of a Current Report on Form 8-K.<B> </B></P>
