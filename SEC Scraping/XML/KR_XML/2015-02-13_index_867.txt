                Edward C. Johnson 3d is a Director and the Chairman of FMR
LLC and Abigail P. Johnson is a Director, the Vice Chairman, the Chief
Executive Officer and the President of FMR LLC.



                Members of the family of Edward C. Johnson 3d, including
Abigail P. Johnson, are the predominant owners, directly or through trusts,
of Series B voting common shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting
power of FMR LLC. The Johnson family group and all other Series B
shareholders have entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under which
all Series B voting common shares will be voted in accordance with the
majority vote of Series B voting common shares. Accordingly, through their
ownership of voting common shares and the execution of the shareholders'
voting agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, to form a controlling group with respect to
FMR LLC.



                Neither FMR LLC nor Edward C. Johnson 3d nor Abigail P.
Johnson has the sole power to vote or direct the voting of the shares owned
directly by the various investment companies registered under the
Investment Company Act ("Fidelity Funds") advised by Fidelity Management &
Research Company ("FMR Co"), a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR LLC, which
power resides with the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees. Fidelity
Management & Research Company carries out the voting of the shares under
written guidelines established by the Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees.



                This filing reflects the securities beneficially owned, or
that may be deemed to be beneficially owned, by FMR LLC, certain of its
subsidiaries and affiliates, and other companies (collectively, the "FMR
Reporters"). This filing does not reflect securities, if any, beneficially
owned by certain other companies whose beneficial ownership of securities
is disaggregated from that of the FMR Reporters in accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998).
