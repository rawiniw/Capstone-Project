                Abigail P. Johnson is a Director, the Vice Chairman, the
Chief Executive Officer and the President of FMR LLC.



                Members of the Johnson family, including Abigail P.
Johnson, are the predominant owners, directly or through trusts, of Series
B voting common shares of FMR LLC, representing 49% of the voting power of
FMR LLC. The Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have
entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under which all Series B
voting common shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of
Series B voting common shares. Accordingly, through their ownership of
voting common shares and the execution of the shareholders' voting
agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, to form a controlling group with respect to
FMR LLC.



                Neither FMR LLC nor Abigail P. Johnson has the sole power
to vote or direct the voting of the shares owned directly by the various
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act ("Fidelity
Funds") advised by Fidelity Management & Research Company ("FMR Co"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of FMR LLC, which power resides with the Fidelity
Funds' Boards of Trustees. Fidelity Management & Research Company carries
out the voting of the shares under written guidelines established by the
Fidelity Funds' Boards of Trustees.



                This filing reflects the securities beneficially owned, or
that may be deemed to be beneficially owned, by FMR LLC, certain of its
subsidiaries and affiliates, and other companies (collectively, the "FMR
Reporters"). This filing does not reflect securities, if any, beneficially
owned by certain other companies whose beneficial ownership of securities
is disaggregated from that of the FMR Reporters in accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998).


RULE 13d-1(k)(1) AGREEMENT


                The undersigned persons, on February 12, 2016, agree and
consent to the joint filing on their behalf of this Schedule 13G in
connection with their beneficial ownership of the COMMON STOCK of KROGER CO
at December 31, 2015.
