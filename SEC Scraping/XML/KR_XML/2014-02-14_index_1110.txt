	FIL Limited ("FIL"), Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow Lane,

provide investment advisory and management services to a
number of non-U.S. investment companies and certain
institutional investors.  FIL, which is a qualified institution
under section 240.13d-1(b)(1)(ii), is the beneficial owner of
175,580 shares or 0.034% of the Common Stock outstanding
of the Company.

	Partnerships controlled predominantly by members of
the family of Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR LLC
and FIL, or trusts for their benefit, own shares of FIL voting
stock. While the percentage of total voting power represented
by these shares may fluctuate as a result of changes in the total
number of shares of FIL voting stock outstanding from time to
time, it normally represents more than 25% and less than 50%
of the total votes which may be cast by all holders of FIL
voting stock. FMR LLC and FIL are separate and independent
corporate entities, and their Boards of Directors are generally
composed of different individuals.

	FMR LLC and FIL are of the view that they are not
acting as a "group" for purposes of Section 13(d) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934" Act) and that
they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the
"beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by
the other corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act.  Therefore, they are of the
view that the shares held by the other corporation need not be
aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR
LLC is making this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the
shares are beneficially owned by FMR LLC and FIL on a joint
basis.
