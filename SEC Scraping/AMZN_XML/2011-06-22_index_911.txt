<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The State of Texas sales tax contingency arose in September 2010 when the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts sent the Company a series
of letters advising that, following a field audit, the Comptroller had determined that at least one as yet undetermined Amazon-affiliated entity had a substantial nexus with the State of Texas and that such entity was liable for an estimated total
of up to $269 million in uncollected state sales tax (including interest and penalties). The Comptroller also stated that such liability would ultimately need to be paid by only one entity. The Company promptly disclosed this contingency in the Note
3, &#147;Commitments and Contingencies &#150; Other Contingencies,&#148; to its consolidated financial statements in its next periodic report, which was the Company&#146;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on October&nbsp;22, 2010 (page 9). In
that filing, the Company also disclosed that it believed the Texas determination was without merit and that it would vigorously contest the assessment. The Company&#146;s determination was based upon a number of factors, including the fact that
pertinent U.S. Supreme Court and other state and federal precedents have established a &#147;bright line&#148; test for determining whether an out-of-state retailer has a sufficiently &#147;substantial nexus&#148; with the taxing state such that the
state may impose, consistent with the Commerce Clause, an obligation to collect state sales tax on that out-of-state retailer; and that this test has not been satisfied in Texas with regard to Amazon&#146;s out-of-state retailer (Amazon.com LLC)
because that retailer has no employees, physical operations, subsidiaries, or agents in Texas. Accordingly, under ASC 450-20-50, the Company believes that it has timely and appropriately satisfied any disclosure obligations in respect of this
contingency. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Note 10 &#150; Segment Information, page 64 </U></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

10-K we disclose the allowance for doubtful customers and vendor receivables; trade accounts receivable and vendor receivable balances; and discussions of items that impact our recognized revenue, including sales return and commission allowances. We
do not disclose receivable allowances or sales return and commissions returns allowance activity in Schedule II &#150; Valuation and Qualifying Accounts because such activity for each of 2010, 2009, and 2008 was less than 1.4% of net sales and was
thus not material. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In Note 9, &#147;Income Taxes,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in our 2010 10-K (page 63)
we disclose deferred tax assets as well as the balance of our valuation allowances in a tabular format. In footnote (4)&nbsp;to the table, we disclose that our deferred tax valuation allowance &#147;[r]elates primarily to deferred tax assets that
would only be realizable upon the generation of future capital gains and net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions.&#148; We believe that this disclosure in footnote (4)&nbsp;is useful as a majority of the fluctuation in our valuation
allowance relates directly to changes to our deferred taxes relating to assets held for investment and losses generated in certain foreign jurisdictions both of which can only be utilized in limited circumstances. Furthermore, to the extent that
activity occurs in the valuation allowance other than that described by footnote (4), those changes that have a significant impact to our provision for income taxes are disclosed in the effective tax rate reconciliation in our income tax footnote
(page 62). We believe that the disclosures in Note 9 provide all the elements that would be required in Schedule II as prescribed by Rule 12-09 of Regulation S-X. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
