Amazon.com, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) among Whole Foods Market, Inc., a Texas corporation (&#147;Whole Foods Market&#148;), the Company, and Walnut Merger Sub,
Inc., a Texas corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Whole Foods Market (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with Whole Foods Market
continuing as the surviving company in the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the
Merger, each share of common stock, no par value, of Whole Foods Market (&#147;Whole Foods Market Shares&#148;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than Whole Foods Market Shares owned by the Company,
Merger Sub, Whole Foods Market, or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties and Whole Foods Market Shares owned by shareholders who have exercised their rights as
dissenting owners under Texas law) will be converted into the right to receive $42.00 per Whole Foods Market Share in cash, without interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger
Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Whole Foods Market and the Company relating to their respective businesses, in each case generally subject to materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for
customary <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-closing</FONT> covenants of Whole Foods Market, including covenants relating to conducting its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and refraining from taking certain actions
without the Company&#146;s consent, covenants not to solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning or provide information in connection with alternative transactions, and
covenants requiring Whole Foods Market&#146;s board of directors, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that Whole Foods Market&#146;s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement. Prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by Whole Foods
Market&#146;s shareholders, Whole Foods Market&#146;s board of directors may withdraw, qualify, or modify its recommendation that Whole Foods Market&#146;s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement or approve, recommend, or otherwise declare
advisable any Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) subject to complying with notice and other specified conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whole Foods Market
and the Company have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things, consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable and obtain any
required regulatory approvals. The Company is not required to take any action or to agree to any restriction or condition with respect to any asset, operation, business, or the conduct of business of the Company, Whole Foods Market, or their
respective subsidiaries, other than divestitures of certain Whole Foods Market assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions,
including, among others, customary conditions relating to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of Whole Foods Market&#146;s shareholders and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and Competition Act (Canada) clearance. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on the other party&#146;s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to
certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not conditioned on the Company&#146;s receipt of financing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement also provides for certain mutual termination rights of the Company and Whole Foods Market, including the right of either party to
terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by February&nbsp;15, 2018 (the &#147;Outside Date&#148;), provided that the Outside Date may be extended one time for a period of 90 days under certain circumstances. Either party may
also terminate the Merger Agreement if the Whole Foods Market shareholder approval has not been obtained at a duly convened meeting of Whole Foods Market shareholders or an order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger becomes final and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-appealable.</FONT> In addition, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Whole Foods Market board of directors changes its recommendation of the Merger
prior to the Whole Foods Market shareholder approval having been obtained. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whole Foods Market will be obligated to pay a fee equal to $400&nbsp;million
(the &#147;Termination Fee&#148;) if the Merger Agreement is terminated (i)&nbsp;by the Company because the Whole Foods Market board of directors has changed its recommendation of the Merger prior to the Whole Foods Market shareholder approval
having been obtained, or (ii)&nbsp;by Whole Foods Market if, prior to the time the Whole Foods Market shareholder approval is obtained, Whole Foods Market enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) that
provides for a Superior Proposal. Whole Foods Market will also be required to pay the Termination Fee in certain other circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated and Whole Foods Market or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger
Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors
with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Whole Foods Market, or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being
qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the
contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date
of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company&#146;s public disclosures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Financing of the
Merger </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company expects to finance the Merger with debt financing, which could include senior unsecured notes issued in capital markets
transactions, term loans, bridge loans, or any combination thereof, together with cash on hand. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company has entered into a commitment letter (the &#147;Commitment Letter&#148;), dated as of
June&nbsp;15, 2017, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, and Bank of America, N.A. (collectively, the &#147;Commitment Parties&#148;), pursuant to which,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Commitment Parties have committed to provide a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">364-day</FONT> senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$13.7&nbsp;billion (the &#147;Bridge Facility&#148;), to fund the consideration for the Merger. Bridge Facility availability is subject to reduction in equivalent amounts upon any incurrence by the Company of term loans and/or the issuance of notes
in a public offering or private placement prior to the consummation of the Merger and upon other specified events, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment
Letter is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including (i)&nbsp;the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms sets forth in the Commitment Letter, and
(ii)&nbsp;the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Merger Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Commitment Letter and the transactions
contemplated thereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Commitment Letter, a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-K</FONT> as Exhibit 10.1 and
the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s statements related to the proposed merger with Whole Foods Market contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding
expected benefits of the merger, the timing of the transaction, and financing of the transaction. Actual results could differ materially from those projected or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially include the following: Whole Foods Market shareholders may not approve the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction may not be satisfied, or the regulatory approvals required for the transaction may not be
obtained on the terms expected, on the anticipated schedule, or at all; long-term financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all; closing of the transaction may not occur or may be delayed, either as a result of litigation related to
the transaction or otherwise; the parties may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs, customer loss, and business disruption (including,
without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers) may be greater than expected; the Company may assume unexpected risks and liabilities; completing the merger may distract the Company&#146;s
management from other important matters; and the other factors discussed in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K</FONT> for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and
subsequent filings with the SEC, which are available at <I>http://www.sec.gov</I>. The Company assumes no obligation to update the information in the communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="tx352949_2"></A>ITEM&nbsp;7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

statements, including statements regarding expected benefits of the merger, the timing of the transaction, and financing of the transaction. Actual results could differ materially from those projected or forecast in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: Whole Foods Market shareholders may not approve the transaction; the conditions to the completion of the transaction may not be satisfied, or the regulatory
approvals required for the transaction may not be obtained on the terms expected, on the anticipated schedule, or at all; long-term financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all; closing of the transaction may not occur or may be
delayed, either as a result of litigation related to the transaction or otherwise; the parties may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs,
customer loss, and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers) may be greater than expected; the Company may assume unexpected risks and liabilities;
completing the merger may distract the Company&#146;s management from other important matters; and the other factors discussed in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in Amazon&#146;s Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K</FONT> for

the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148;
