<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Investors are concerned by sales of Rekognition to government
in the United States and globally because this highly controversial technology poses tremendous risks involving civil and human
rights and government surveillance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Rekognition is a facial recognition technology tool that is
being deployed for facial recognition and recognition of other imagery in photographic and video recordings as one application
available through Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS offers cloud-based products including &ldquo;compute, storage, databases, analytics,
networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications.&rdquo;<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>
As promoted on the AWS web site, Rekognition is marketed in a suite of apps; it is offered &ldquo;free&rdquo; to new AWS subscribers.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>
AWS&rsquo;s apparent intention is to offer apps that will induce subscribers to use more of AWS&rsquo;s cloud services.<BR>
<BR>
AWS is by far the largest provider of Internet &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; services in the world, with 2018 revenue of $25.6 billion.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>3</SUP></FONT>
AWS currently provides cloud services for all 17 United States intelligence agencies, as well as for government agencies internationally<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>
in the United Kingdom, Italy, Singapore, Belgium, Canada, and Turkey. The FBI is testing Amazon&rsquo;s Rekognition<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>5</SUP></FONT>,
and Amazon is attempting to sell Rekognition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>.
Florida&rsquo;s Orlando Police Department (OPD) and the city of Orlando, in July 2018, announced it would continue to use Rekognition
after an initial pilot program.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT> Amazon lists the Washington County Sheriff&rsquo;s
Office in Oregon, WA as a Rekognition customer.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>8</SUP></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">According to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights (Principle 17),<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>9</SUP></FONT> Amazon has a responsibility for the use of
its products, and human rights due diligence should cover &ldquo;impacts that the business enterprise may cause or contribute to
through its own activities, or which may be directly linked to its operations, products or services by its business relationships.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the hands of government, Rekognition threatens civil liberties
and civil rights for all members of society, and especially for people who are more likely to be surveilled, profiled and targeted,
including people of color and immigrants. Clare Garvie, of Georgetown Law&rsquo;s Center on Privacy &amp; Technology, has written<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>10</SUP></FONT>:
&ldquo;A mistake by a face-scanning surveillance system on a body camera could be lethal. An officer, alerted to a potential threat
to public safety or to himself, must, in an instant, decide whether to draw his weapon. A false alert places an innocent person
in those crosshairs.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>11</SUP></FONT>
has noted that facial recognition technology threatens to &ldquo;chill First Amendment-protected activity like engaging in protest
or practicing religion, and it can be used to subject immigrants to further abuse from the government.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon has repeatedly responded to the controversy in defense
of Rekognition. In February 2019, AWS&rsquo;s Global Public Policy VP published a blog post outlining key areas where the Company
was taking the unusual step of calling for enhanced regulatory policies surrounding facial recognition technology, especially
when used by police.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>12</SUP></FONT> <B>Amazon&rsquo;s blog post is a clear recognition that
the Company has placed onto the market a technology that is most inadequately controlled and regulated. </B>Public expectations
of privacy and respect for civil rights are not presently protected, and Rekognition should not be sold until it is regulated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While the accuracy of Rekognition&rsquo;s technology is a concern
&mdash; multiple studies by M.I.T. researchers and the ACLU have found that racial and gender bias is embedded in Rekognition<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>13</SUP></FONT>
&mdash; there are more fundamental issues, including whether facial recognition should be deployed at all because of the role the
technology plays in enabling ubiquitous government surveillance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Indeed, scientific and academic research suggests that over
time the societal risks embedded in a technology such as Rekognition may not decline but may instead increase quickly and dramatically
as Rekognition is deployed more widely. In April 2019, 25 prominent artificial-intelligence researchers &mdash; including experts
at Amazon competitors Google, Facebook and Microsoft, and a winner of the prestigious Turing Award &mdash; called on Amazon to
stop selling Rekognition to government.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>14</SUP></FONT> &ldquo;There are no laws or required
standards to ensure that Rekognition is used in a manner that does not infringe on civil liberties,&rdquo; the AI researchers wrote.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">This is particularly concerning for those whose human rights
are neglected by autocratic government regimes. Human rights organizations cite the deployment of facial recognition in China,
where, according to one expert, &ldquo;surveillance technologies are giving the government a sense that it can finally achieve
the level of control over people&rsquo;s lives that it aspires to.&rdquo;<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>15</SUP></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Scholars Woodrow Hartzog and Evan Selinger have written<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>16</SUP></FONT>:
&ldquo;We believe facial recognition technology is the most uniquely dangerous surveillance mechanism ever invented...when technologies
become so dangerous, and the harm-to-benefit ratio becomes so imbalanced, categorical bans are worth considering.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Amazon is reported to be the second most trusted institution
in the United States<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>17</SUP></FONT>, and sales of Rekognition threaten this extraordinary
relationship of trust on which the Company relies for success. </B>Given the serious potential risks outlined above, manifestation
of these potential harms could result in a negative financial impact on Amazon, through, for example, a decrease in sales or contracts
due to diminished consumer trust that negatively impacts the demand for Amazon products and services and increases the cost of
business. Research shows that being linked to adverse human rights impacts can negatively impact a company&rsquo;s reputation and
harm its potential to secure future contracts. A recent study quantifying the material impact of the reputational harm for Energy
Transfer Partners (ETP) due to its inadequate stakeholder consultation and public pressure from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to
the Dakota Access Pipeline demonstrated that social tension negatively impacted stock price and ETP underperformed relative to
market expectations as a result of the controversy. Growing and widespread social controversy and public pressure surrounding Rekognition
may negatively impact Amazon&rsquo;s financial performance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Rekognition, as a potential tool for surveillance when sold
to government, already presents material issues for Amazon regarding consumer privacy. According to the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board (SASB)<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>18</SUP></FONT>, which identifies environmental, social and governance
factors most likely to materially impact the financial condition or operating performance of companies in an industry, consumer
privacy is likely to be a material issue for companies operating in technology and communications. This includes the management
of risks related to the use of personally identifiable information (such as biometric data collected through facial recognition
technology), social issues that may arise from a company&rsquo;s collecting information (such as public controversies surrounding
the collection of facial imagery), and managing evolving regulation (such as regulation around the commercial use of facial recognition).&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The public controversy surrounding Rekognition presents critical
risks to the Company&rsquo;s reputation, including the willingness of consumers to trust the company to safeguard their privacy
and civil and human rights because storing your data on their cloud requires that you trust them to keep your data safe. Therefore,
consumer trust is one of Amazon&rsquo;s most important intangible assets. This comes as Amazon, with its leadership position in
the technology sector, confronts growing public criticism regarding the role of technology companies, including Amazon.com, and
its products and services, in societies and economies around the world. Thus, proponents believe Rekognition also threatens Amazon&rsquo;s
long-term prospects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The increasing controversy surrounding Rekognition highlights
the fragile relationship of trust between the Company and its consumers, employees, and the public at large. A number of the Company&rsquo;s
products &ndash; Alexa, Ring, and Eero &mdash; could face a spillover effect if Amazon&rsquo;s ability to maintain the trust of
customers is breached by concerns about privacy and surveillance. Moreover, in addition to the Company&rsquo;s unique exposure
to risk by virtue of it being a business operating in the technology sector, it also has a product pipeline and pending patent
applications which demonstrate the trajectory of the Company will confront just such concerns. For example, two facial recognition-related
patent applications filed by the Company feature a technology that could use multiple cameras to create a composite image of a
person&rsquo;s partially seen face, and could then automatically alert law enforcement if a &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; person or
known criminal is in view of Ring&rsquo;s cameras.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>21</SUP></FONT> Only this month, multiple
media outlets sparked controversy with reports that Amazon employees were &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to recordings from Alexa devices

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon&rsquo;s status as an employer of choice, and Amazon&rsquo;s
ability to be consistent with the values of its employees, is being undermined by the Company&rsquo;s internal management and potential
sale of surveillance technologies, including Rekognition. The company&rsquo;s lack of transparency about the nature of its sales
and failure to respond to employees who do not want to use their time and talent in support of selling surveillance technology
to government may be hurting Amazon&rsquo;s ability to attract, hire, retain, and maintain good relations with employees. Amazon
risks losing top new talent as millennials in the workforce seek employment from companies who can match their values. An Accenture
report found that 70% of 2016 college graduates prefer an employer who offers a positive social atmosphere, and companies that
&ldquo;do good&rdquo;, over a higher salary; 92% said it was important their employer demonstrate social responsibility.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>33</SUP></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The Company&rsquo;s attempt this past June to sell Rekognition

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in">&ldquo;...We learn from history, and we understand

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In addition to products that present these concerns, surveillance
issues raised by Rekognition are mirrored within the Company itself in how it tracks its own employees. The Company was granted
two patents recently that would allow it to track its workers&rsquo; hand movements through wristbands. By tracking detailed movements
through artificial intelligence technologies, the Company can also obtain and record highly private information, such as when an
employee takes a bathroom break. This degree of monitoring adds Fourth Amendment privacy intrusion concerns to the mix of a work
culture already criticized for pressuring employees to work long hours and perform above all else, threatening the long-term performance
and health of the company overall.</P>

<BR>
By supporting this Proposal, investors are applying the &ldquo;precautionary principle.&rdquo; Adopted globally in 1992 as part
of the United Nations Rio Convention on sustainable development, the precautionary principle implies that where there are threats
of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing protective measures.
It has been deployed by companies in decisions to phase out the use of toxic chemicals and in legislation on environmental and
health protection. This approach is consistent with prudent risk management. For Amazon&rsquo;s Rekognition, investors are applying
the precautionary principle by pausing to assess risk.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon&rsquo;s Rekognition technology poses a powerful and potentially
irreversible threat to civil and human rights. As a consequence, it also jeopardizes shareholder value. The precautionary approach,
by halting sales of facial recognition to government agencies and by assessing and reporting on these impacts and risks, is therefore
necessary here to ensure sound stewardship at the Company. The Proposal suggests that the Company can and should undertake more
high-level oversight of these issues before marketing the technology, especially for use by government and police. This is especially
the case because experts warn that facial recognition software gives the government the power to violate civil liberties &ndash;
targeting immigrants, religious minorities, and people of color, in new, hyper-powered ways.<BR>
<BR>
In the technology industry overall, companies often seek to gain market advantage by establishing their place as the first mover
of a new product or technology; however, in the case of Rekognition, the application of the precautionary principle is warranted
because the extensive, aforementioned risks of marketing the technology far outweigh any potential benefits of being a first mover
of this dangerous technology.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>2. Amazon&rsquo;s existing management systems and processes
fail to address the risks of sales of Rekognition and an independent assessment is needed to ensure it will not cause harm.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B><I>Amazon&rsquo;s existing policy to mitigate risks of sales

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In its Opposition Statement, Amazon argued that the AWS Acceptable
Use Policy protects against risks posed by illegal or harmful use of Rekognition. Amazon asserts in the Opposition Statement that
customers who gain access to deploy Rekognition must comply with its Acceptable Use Policy which prohibits the use of its products
&ldquo;for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use,&rdquo; including the violation of laws related to privacy,
discrimination and civil rights, and that Amazon has not received a single report of Rekognition being used in a harmful manner
as posited in the proposal. Recent experience, however, demonstrates that the Acceptable Use Policy is no guarantee that the AWS
platform will not be used in a harmful manner. According to multiple media reports<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>35</SUP></FONT>,
a Mexico-based news site used Amazon servers to openly store 540 million records on Facebook users, including identification numbers,
comments, reactions and account names. The problem was detected by researchers at an independent security firm which reportedly
sent emails to Amazon &ldquo;over many months&rdquo; to alert it to the problem. Amazon reportedly failed to respond to those messages.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon itself has shifted its stated position that existing
company policies protect users and the Company from significant risk. For example, in the face of the groundswell of concern by
NGOs and civil liberties experts, a leading company spokesman, as discussed above and in the Opposition Statement to the Proposal,
tempered the Company&rsquo;s position, calling for government regulation and &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; among stakeholders, including
shareholders. It is frankly difficult to understand why the company is opposing the current Proposal, as the Proposal itself seems
to provide the opportunity to fulfill exactly the terms of Amazon&rsquo;s own invitation for &ldquo;open, honest, and earnest
dialogue&rdquo; with the Company&rsquo;s shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Shareholders are concerned with violations by government customers
particularly. Currently, the FBI is petitioning for face recognition systems to be exempt from the prohibitions on tracking people
during the exercise of their right to free speech.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>36</SUP></FONT> In addition, long-standing
rules that have precluded the FBI and Department of Homeland Security from tracking the identity of individuals during the exercise
of free speech appear to be at risk.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>37</SUP></FONT> Therefore, the Acceptable Use Policy provisions
are far from self-executing, and as the example of the FBI request for waiver of normal civil liberties protections demonstrates,
the evidence shows that the Acceptable Use Policy is ineffective at protecting people from the harms of surveillance technology
in the hands of government.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Governance of the significant risks presented by Rekognition
is lacking. Instead of company oversight, it appears that the responsibility falls to the customer for ensuring that the technology
is not used in illegal or harmful ways that threaten shareholder value. This is too significant of an issue for the company to
abdicate its responsibility to protect human rights. The Proponents are concerned that the Amazon board is not equipped to adequately
identify and assess the risks posed by Rekognition. The directors overall lack expertise that would give them the background or
tools to assess the human rights impacts of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the primary technologies behind a product
like Rekognition. One possible exception is director Daniel Huttenlocher, who holds a Ph.D in Computer Science from MIT and hails
an interest in &quot;emerging technologies.&quot; The board also lacks any governance committee tasked with overseeing these risks.
This is another reason why sales should be stopped until an independent group of experts has the ability to assess the risks and
advise the board on whether or how it could proceed with sales of Rekognition to governments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Amazon&rsquo;s peer companies in the technology sector have
implemented stronger governance mechanisms to oversee human rights and ethics concerns posed by the sale of technologies. Amazon
maintains three board committees: a Leadership Development and Compensation Committee, an Audit Committee, and a Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee. None of the committee charters make mention of human rights concerns or ethics in any manner. For
a company as large as Amazon with business interests with implications in as many areas of society as Amazon, this is an especially
egregious omission of purpose.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Similarly, in May 2018 Facebook announced an &ldquo;AI ethics
team&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;ensure that its artificial intelligence systems make decisions as ethically as possible,
without biases.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the March of the same year, Microsoft formed the AI and Ethics
in Engineering and Research (AETHER) Committee bringing together senior leaders from across the company to focus on proactive formulation
of internal policies and how to respond to specific issues in a responsible way. Amazon has no similar effort. Microsoft&rsquo;s
committee however, set clear guidelines to identify, study and recommend policies, procedures, and best practices on questions,
challenges, and opportunities coming to the fore on influences of AI on people and society, and invest in strategies and tools
for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and implementing new requirements established by the GDPR. Microsoft&rsquo;s cleaner
reputation in this area is a result of these measures.<BR></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Even without committees, companies demonstrate their commitment
to establish an ethical framework with new technologies by taking measures to call for their regulation, refusing to bid on or
pursue contracts with the government, or establishing specialty leadership roles. This month, Microsoft turned down a sale of facial
recognition software to a CA law enforcement agency, citing human rights concerns.<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>40</SUP></FONT>
Salesforce, for example, employs a chief ethical and humane use officer. In all three of these proposed avenues, Amazon goes against
the grain.</P>
