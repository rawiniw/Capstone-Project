      Know all persons by these presents, that the undersigned hereby

(1) execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's

capacity as an officer and/or director of Amazon.com, Inc. (the "Company"),

Forms 3, 4s and 5s in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder;



(2) do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned

that may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Forms 3,

4s and 5s and timely file such form with the United States Securities and

Exchange Commission and any stock exchange or similar authority; and



(3) take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the

foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit

to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it

being understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on

behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in

      The undersigned hereby grants to such attorney-in-fact full power and

authority to do and perform each and every act and thing whatsoever

requisite, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the

rights and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as

are based on any untrue statement or omission of necessary facts in the

information provided by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact for

purposes of executing, acknowledging, delivering and filing Forms 3, 4s

or 5s (including amendments thereto) and agrees to reimburse the Company

and such attorney-in-fact for any legal or other expenses reasonably

incurred in connection with investigating or defending against any such

loss, claim, damage, liability or action.



      This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until

the undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4s and 5s with

respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities

issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a

signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorney-in-fact.



      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of

Attorney to be executed as of this 6th day of November, 2002.
