# Capstone-Project-Retail-Industry-Landscape-Analysis

This project was completed as the capstone project for the MS in Business Analytics program at UT Austin. Our client was Walmart. The premise of the project was to collect, clean, and preprocess publicly available text data, such as SEC filings, proxy statements, and earnings call transcripts, and identify critical topics and trends in the retail landscape for the past 10 years. We analyzed Walmart, Target, Kroger, Costco, and Amazon. 

We then used the topics identified and analyzed how the discussion of these topics by each company has affected their stock price percent change over the years.
