Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports, statements, and information that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (which individually or together with its subsidiaries, as
the context otherwise requires, is referred to as "we," "Walmart" or the "Company") has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") or may file with or furnish to the SEC in the future, and prior or future public announcements and presentations that we or our management have made or
may make, include or may include, or incorporate or may incorporate by reference, statements that may be deemed to be "forward-looking statements" within the

Nature of Forward-Looking Statements
Such forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead express our estimates or expectations for our economic performance or results

store and club sales for one or more of our reportable segments, our effective tax rate, the dividends we will pay, our capital structure, the outcome of tax matters,
the outcome of, the costs we may incur in connection with, and the liability we may have or not have in, legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are subject,

income, other income, e-commerce sales, gross merchandise value, inventory levels, performance of certain categories of merchandise, capital expenditures,
expense items, store and club openings, the amount and nature of capital and operating expenditures and investments, increases in retail square footage, the
consummation of acquisitions or dispositions, and other financial measures or metrics.
Our forward-looking statements also include statements of our strategies, plans and objectives for our operations, including areas of future focus in our operations,

decrease," "will grow," "will have," "will increase," "will remain," "will strengthen" and "will stay," variations of such words or phrases, other phrases
commencing with the word "will" or similar words and phrases denoting anticipated or expected occurrences or results. The forward-looking statements include
statements made in Part I, Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as to our belief that the possible loss or range of any possible loss that
may be incurred in connection with certain legal proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

WAL-MART STORES, INC.
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2017
PART I
ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or
through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and
physical shopping and saves time for our customers. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate. Digital retail is
comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve over 260 million customers who visit our 11,695 stores under 59
banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries.
Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust
of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy
under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is
core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital
and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and
physical shopping experience.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States
("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "), January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 ") and January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 "). During fiscal 2017 , we generated
total revenues of $485.9 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $481.3 billion .
We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a
franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in
Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.
In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of
January 31, 2017 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries.
In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31,
2017 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.

Information About Our Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and retail websites in the U.S. and 10 other countries. The Company's operations are conducted in
three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief
operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services
in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as
well as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has
historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount
to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail,
wholesale and other. These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs),
cash & carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generated
approximately 24% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its
merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 47 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accounted
for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's
operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate
overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as
determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are
reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
Walmart U.S. Segment
The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart," "Wal-Mart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market"
brands, as well as walmart.com and other digital retail. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $307.8 billion , $298.4 billion and $288.0 billion for fiscal 2017
, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales.
Physical. The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states,
Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 31 states and Puerto
Rico. The following table provides square footage details on each of our formats as of January 31, 2017 :

Digital. Walmart U.S. provides its customers access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our physical stores, and services online
through our e-commerce websites, including walmart.com, jet.com, hayneedle.com and shoebuy.com, as well as mobile commerce applications. Walmart.com
experiences on average 92 million unique visitors a month and offers access to over 38 million SKUs, including those carried on Marketplace, a feature of the
website that permits third parties to sell merchandise on walmart.com. Walmart.com is also integrated with our physical stores through services like "Walmart
Pickup," "Pickup Today" and "Online Grocery." The Walmart U.S. segment also offers access to digital content and services including Vudu and InstaWatch.
Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below, across several store formats including supercenters, discount stores,
Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats, as well as on our e-commerce websites.
• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural & organics, deli & bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and
nonalcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods
and pet supplies;
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services, and over-the-counter drugs and other medical products;
• General merchandise includes:
◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, cameras and supplies, photo processing services, cellular phones, cellular service plan contracts and prepaid

merchandise).
The Walmart U.S. segment also offers fuel and financial services and related products, including money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, money transfers,
check cashing and bill payment. These services total less than 1% of annual net sales.
National brand merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in the Walmart U.S. segment. We also market lines of merchandise under our
private-label store brands, including: "Adventure Force," "AutoDrive," "BlackWeb," "Equate," "Everstart," "Faded Glory," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday
Time," "Hyper Tough," "Kid Connection," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "My Life As," "No Boundaries," "Ol' Roy," "Onn," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice,"

Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous
periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and Neighborhood Markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our stores
and through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays,
as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
9

Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar,
drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, e-commerce and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for
new or relocated retail units.
Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical
shopping largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our
industry. These programs include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;
• Rollbacks: our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;
• Savings Catcher, Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price;
• Walmart Pickup: customer places order online and picks it up for free from a store. The merchandise is fulfilled through our distribution facilities;
• Pickup Today: customer places order online and picks it up at a store within four hours for free. The order is fulfilled through existing store inventory;
• Online Grocery: customer places grocery order online and has it delivered to home or picks it up at one of our participating stores or remote locations; and
• Money Back Guarantee: our commitment to ensure the quality and freshness of the fruits and vegetables in our stores by offering our customers a 100
percent money-back guarantee if they are not satisfied.
We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products they
need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience. In addition, our retail website and mobile commerce applications are important factors
in our competition with other retailers, particularly e-commerce retailers.

Digital. The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South
Africa and the United Kingdom). Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a
broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click & Collect" in
the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope
of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed
market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,"
"George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands
including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," and "Extra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each
market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,
depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume
and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department,
drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the
markets in which we operate. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop,
open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a
large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model
and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant
impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce
applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases,
both in our digital and physical retail operations.
12

Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and
the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International
segment. During fiscal 2017 , approximately 82% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the
balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further
details of our international distribution facilities, including 15 e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2016, with the exception of

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as
well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco Wholesale, as well as with discount retailers,
retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes
with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment,
and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important
factors in our ability to compete with other membership-only warehouse clubs.
Distribution. During fiscal 2017 , approximately 68% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's 25 dedicated
distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club
segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. The table below provides further

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution
process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and
sometimes less than an hour.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.

Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its ecommerce dedicated fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.
Other Segment Information
Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 ("Annual Report
to Shareholders") under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 14 in the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 14 also includes information regarding total
revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as Exhibit 13 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property
as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and
confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international
domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary
technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United
States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located
near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant
percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such
suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other
applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within
the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs
and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.
Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2017 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees ("associates") worldwide, with nearly 1.5 million
associates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt
associates and a large number of associates turn over each year. We believe our relationships with our associates are good.
On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time
associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016, and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and
part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases. Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring,
training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure. These changes give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn
higher pay and advance in their careers.
Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards
or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock
Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S. The Company's medical
plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.
Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory
requirements.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could
also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.
Strategic Risks
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.
Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other
energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of
unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and
shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws, changes in
healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall
economic slowdown and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the
products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary
purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely
affect our operations and operating results.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs
or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general
and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the
goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,
demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of
our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products
and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the
combination of both retail offerings. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of
primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the
choices available to consumers for purchasing products. As a result of these factors, we
17

plan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a
greater extent on comparable store sales and e-commerce for growth. Any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to
changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,
preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the
growth of our business.
We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both),
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other
important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and
international internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries.
Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores,
supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale
club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, and e-commerce
retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.
Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,
hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience stores
and e-commerce and catalog businesses.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers,
location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce
websites and mobile commerce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online, through mobile commerce
applications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations.
Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower
our prices on goods for sale. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our
financial performance. See " Item 1. Business " above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could
result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved
financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive
positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated
companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
Failure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce
investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.
The retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the
portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace
of this increase could accelerate. We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the
number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in our
calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth.
The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail
channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A .
Our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commerce
business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated
pace of new store and club openings. If we fail to successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely
affected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn,
reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and
materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.
18

In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adversely
impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.
Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as
major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,
such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial
performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution
facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by
such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and
mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term
disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the
delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the
disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores.
These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S.
in 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance.
In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical
storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect
to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses
from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities,
loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the
event of a catastrophe, to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely
affect our financial performance.
Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important
factor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to
otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and
efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'
failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their
manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the
suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of
merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the
suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the
importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our
control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered
by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or
that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and
non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is
19

outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any
food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.
We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and
secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we
have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up
systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer
programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as
fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the
processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. If our information
systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and
we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and
systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will
mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these
initiatives.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our
ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors
and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a
part of our multi-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today" and "Club Pickup" and in a growing number of
locations, "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's
Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our
operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.
We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations
through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide
attractive, user-friendly secure e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery
options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and
related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a
material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and
the computer systems and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired e-commerce businesses, may be subject to
cyber-attacks. Those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of
customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable,
degrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping
experience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications. If we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile
commerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and
deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which
events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.
20

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of
cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us
to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and
store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce websites and
mobile commerce applications. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and
authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information
we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information
over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly
sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or small
groups of "hackers." Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We have in place substantial
security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems. We also have security
processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers, including cloud service providers, to protect information from our
systems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us.
We constantly monitor developments in cyber threats, evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new
and additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the
information stored on our systems. We require our third-party service providers to do the same. Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more
difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and
obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security
measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture
or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service
providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.
Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or
any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any
customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information
systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and
shareholders, as well as our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of
confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the
imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote
significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the
security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of
our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new
payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to
various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security
operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information
security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or
detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any
cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we
may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain
circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment
card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In
addition, the cost of
21

complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us.
Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
The retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are generated by filling
prescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private
insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e.,
shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable
reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise
receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated
by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the
administrative burden associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available
to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes
in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market
generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations;
further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for
drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of
third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including
as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a
law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely
affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a
significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.
One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our
retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -club selling opportunities and, in turn,
adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates
globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and
distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a
sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,
changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to
attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in
February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly. If
we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our
operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing
operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal
2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or
healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
22

Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations, and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that
segment, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have
existing operations. Our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain
qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate
units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units.
In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain
markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets
may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in
such markets which may adversely impact our financial results. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through opening
new units, growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.
Our Walmart International segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our
digital retail operations, physical retail operations or both. For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for Walmart
China to be a preferred retailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace. Any strategic
alliance may not generate the level of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business
relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such as
our investment in JD.com, Inc., could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are
denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses
of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated
financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our
financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate
fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our
reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the
goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable
to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with
a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
23

Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these
expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause
the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or
regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India,
Japan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico.
In fiscal 2017, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The Federal Government has
created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries
where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of
trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. and the imposition of a border tax, or a border adjustment tax, on imports into the U.S. A
significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us
of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could
materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.
During fiscal 2017 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Our operating segments also source goods
and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our
control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local
product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other
matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.
The potential imposition by the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a
country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such
country from the U.S. or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country. This could
materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries.
Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade
policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union.
Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the
Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of
business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they
occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and
fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks
associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international
operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in
enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing
business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and
regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business
practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of other
countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance
programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our
24

associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations
of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so,
violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and
our reputation.
We are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The
U.S. Congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017. Federal tax reform plans under consideration may
result in significant changes to the U.S. tax code. Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could have
the effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could
reduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which
corporate taxable income is taxed. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities
requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have
lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing
tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded
in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such
determination and settlement is made.
We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a
number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of
cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in nearly 10,000 "equal value" claims
pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store
employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs
to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not
objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates
on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may
arise from these proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10
in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other
alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior
allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our
policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the
implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of
additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA.
Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate,
including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") and the SEC. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. As
discussions regarding resolution are preliminary, we cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters. A
number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under
investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and
former officers.
25

We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the
matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,
penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments
against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest
regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain
audiences. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony
and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations.
While we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations we
cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters
will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be
material to our business in the future.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for
operations and field and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors
to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales
volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents.
For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under " Item 1. Business ."

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies,"
which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference in this item. We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal
proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal
proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v
Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom
Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal).
II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a
news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges
various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or
acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants'
conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants
filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the
allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which
the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary
duties in connection with their oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the
Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed
their notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Arkansas. There was no appeal from that ruling. On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court of
Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated
derivative proceedings filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. On January 18, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded those proceedings
to the Court of Chancery for further briefing and an additional ruling on due process issues raised by the plaintiffs, before the Delaware Supreme Court renders its
ultimate decision on the appeal. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these
proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are
disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that
may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
In November and December 2016, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company,
Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendadora"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to four
stores which the Ministry believed may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license. Arrendadora has challenged the
penalties before an administrative court and the trials are in process. The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to this
matter in 2014, but Arrendadora was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply with
legal formalities in connection with their imposition.
In November 2016, the state environmental agency in Santa Catarina, Brazil imposed aggregate penalties of approximately $180,000 against WMS Supermercados
do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil") related to the fuel station at its store in Posto Camboriú. Such amount includes penalties related to a fuel tank leak and for
operation of the fuel station in non-compliance with its license from 2009-2013 and without a license commencing in 2013. These matters had been self-reported
by Walmart Brazil to the environmental agency following an internal licensure review. Walmart Brazil has filed its defense with the agency against the imposition
of these penalties as well as its remediation plans and has been monitoring the underground water for contamination. Following the filing of that defense, in March
2017 the environmental agency reduced the aggregate penalties to approximately $90,000 which amount has been paid by Walmart Brazil.
During fiscal year 2015, a California Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company that it was investigating whether the Company had violated a California
statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's suppliers as "biodegradable" or "compostable." In January 2017, the Company entered
into a settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately $950,000. The Company also agreed to abide by a permanent injunction requiring
compliance with California's laws related to the sale of products labeled "biodegradable," "degradable," "compostable," or "decomposable."
On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transportation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection
Agency alleging that Walmart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filters
on some diesel fueled vehicles. The Company responded and is in settlement negotiations with the agency.
On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting the
number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts in
respect of inflation and interest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its
defense with the agency against the imposition of this penalty.
In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of
Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution
center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the
time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.
In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil
contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the
District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is
accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is
necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or
manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls
and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more
efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing
monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains
effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions
"Management's Report to Our Shareholders" and "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,"
respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10(d)
WAL-MART STORES, INC.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
(As amended and restated effective June 5, 2015,
and as amended further effective February 1, 2017)

1.1
Purpose and Effective Date. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”) believes it is important to provide incentives to Walmart’s
Associates, and Non-Management Directors, through participation in the ownership of Walmart and otherwise. The Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 was originally established under the name Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of
1998 (“1998 Plan”). The 1998 Plan was amended, restated and renamed from time to time, and approved and re-approved by
Walmart stockholders, as the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 (“2005 Plan”) and the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan of 2010 (“2010 Plan”), as amended and restated in 2013 (“2013 Restatement”), and most recently on June 5, 2015, as
the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (“Plan”). The Plan, as heretofore amended, was amended and restated as of
February 23, 2016 and is hereby further amended and restated as set forth herein effective February 1, 2017. The purpose of the Plan
is to provide incentives to certain Associates and Non-Management Directors to enhance their job performance, to motivate them to
remain or become associated with Walmart and its Affiliates, and to increase the success of Walmart. The Plan is not limited to
Associates who are executive officers of Walmart, but will be available to provide incentives to any Associate or Non-Management
Director that the Committee believes has made or may make a significant contribution to Walmart or an Affiliate of Walmart.
DEFINITIONS
2.1
“Affiliate” means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business trust, other entity or other business
association that is now or hereafter controlled by Walmart; provided that if a Plan Award provides for the deferral of compensation
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and if the applicable Notice of Plan Award does not contain a definition of “Affiliate”
that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 409A, then for purposes of such Plan Award, “Affiliate” means the entity for which
the Recipient performs services and with respect to which the legally binding right to deferred compensation arises, and all persons
that would be considered a single employer with such entity under section 414(b) of the Code (employees of controlled group of
corporations), or section 414(c) of the Code (employees of partnerships, etc. under common control); provided that the applicable
standard of control for purposes of such determination shall be “at least 50 percent”; and provided further that the entity is one with
respect to which Shares will qualify as “service recipient stock” under Code Section 409A.
2.2

“Associate” means any person employed by Walmart or any Affiliate.

2.3

“Board” means the Board of Directors of Walmart.

2.4
“Cause” means a Recipient’s commission of any act deemed inimical to the best interest of Walmart or any Affiliate, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
2.5

“Code ” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

2.6
“Committee ” means the committee of the Board with responsibilities including executive compensation matters subject to
Regulation S-K Item 402, or other committee designated by the Board as the “Committee” under the Plan. Where such committee of
the Board has delegated duties, powers or authority hereunder, the term “Committee” shall refer to the delegate.
2.7
“Continuous Status” means the absence of any interruption or termination of the employment relationship between an
Associate and Walmart or an Affiliate or the absence of any termination of services as a Non-Management Director. Continuous
Status shall not be considered interrupted in the case of (a) sick leave, (b) military leave, or (c) any other leave of absence approved
by Walmart or an Affiliate; provided that leave does not exceed one year, unless re-employment upon the expiration of that leave is
guaranteed by contract or law or unless provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the preceding
definition, if a Plan Award provides for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and if the applicable
Notice of Plan Award does not define a term that is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then for
purposes of such Plan Award the Recipient’s Continuous Status will terminate if it is reasonably anticipated that no further services
would be performed by the Recipient after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Recipient would perform after
such date (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than twenty percent
(20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an Associate or Non-Management Director, or in any other
capacity) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Walmart or an Affiliate if the
Recipient has been providing services to the Walmart or an Affiliate less than 36 months).
2.8

“Covered Employee” has the meaning set forth in Code Section 162(m)(3).

2.9

“Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.

2.10 “Fair Market Value” means, as of any date, the closing sales price for a Share (a) on the NYSE (or if no trading in Shares
occurred on that date, on the last day on which Shares were traded) or (b) if the Shares are not listed for trading on the NYSE, but if
there is a public market for the Shares, the closing sales price of the Shares on such other national exchange on which the Shares are
principally traded (or if no trading in Shares occurred on that date, on the last day on which Shares were traded), or (c) as reported by
the National Market System, or similar organization, or (d) if no such quotations are available, the average of the high bid and low
asked quotations in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated or similar organizations;
or (e) in the event that there is no public market for the Shares, the value of a Share as determined by the reasonable application of a
reasonable valuation method, determined good faith by the Committee; provided that for purposes of tax withholding, for purposes
of a “net exercise” procedure for Options, and for such other purposes as the Committee deems appropriate, the Committee may
apply a different method for calculating Fair Market Value determined in good faith by the Committee for such purpose.
2.11

“Fiscal Year” means the 12-month period beginning on each February 1 and ending on the following January 31.

2.12
“Gross Misconduct” is conduct that the Committee determines is detrimental to the best interests of Walmart or any
Affiliate. Examples of conduct detrimental to the best interests of Walmart or any Affiliate include, without limitation, violation of
Walmart’s Statement of Ethics

theft, the commission of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, gross misconduct or similar serious offenses while providing
services to Walmart or an Affiliate.
2.13
“Incentive Stock Option” means an Option intended to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Code
Section 422.

of Walmart.
2.15
“Nonqualified Option” means an Option not intended to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option or that in fact does not
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.
2.16

“Notice of Plan Award” means the agreement or other document evidencing and governing any Plan Award.

2.17

“NYSE” means the New York Stock Exchange or any successor organization thereto.

2.18

“Option” means a stock option to acquire a certain number of the Subject Shares granted pursuant to the Plan.

2.19
“Parent/Subsidiary Corporation” means a “parent corporation” (within the meaning of Code Section 424(e)) or a
“subsidiary corporation” (within the meaning of Code Section 424(f)) of Walmart, in each case determined as of the date of grant.
2.20
“Performance Goals” means the pre-established objective performance goals established by the Committee for each
Performance Period. The Performance Goals may be based upon the performance of Walmart, of any Affiliate, or a division or unit
thereof, or of an individual Recipient, or groups of Recipients, or of a store or groups of stores, using one or more of the Performance
Measures selected by the Committee. Separate Performance Goals may be established by the Committee for Walmart or any
Affiliate, or division or unit thereof, or an individual Recipient, or groups of Recipients, or of a store or groups of stores, using one
or more of the Performance Measures selected by the Committee and different Performance Measures may be given different
weights. The Performance Goals shall include one or more threshold Performance Goals under which no portion of the Plan Award
shall become vested, be transferred, retained, or the value of which is to be paid as provided by the Plan and Notice of Plan Award, if
the threshold goal or goals are not achieved. With respect to Recipients who are not Covered Employees, the Committee may
establish other subjective or objective goals, including individual Performance Goals, which it deems appropriate. The preceding
sentence shall also apply to Covered Employees with respect to any Plan Awards not intended at the time of grant to be Qualified
Performance Based Awards.
Performance Goals may be set at a specific level, or may be expressed as a relative percentage to the comparable measure at
comparison companies, business units, divisions or individuals or a defined index. Performance Goals shall, to the extent applicable,
be based upon generally accepted accounting principles, but shall be adjusted by the Committee to take into account the effect of the
following, to the extent determined by the Committee prior to the grant: changes in applicable accounting standards after the
Performance Goal is established; realized investment gains and/or losses; extraordinary, unusual, non-recurring or infrequent items;
currency fluctuations; acquisitions; divestitures; litigation losses; financing activities; expenses for restructuring or productivity
initiatives; other non-operating items; new laws, cases or regulatory developments that result in unanticipated items of gain, loss,
income or expense; executive
3

severance arrangements; investment returns relating to investment vehicles which are unaffiliated with a corporate or divisional
operating strategy; bonus expense; the impact on pre-tax income of interest expense attributable to the repurchase of Shares;
extraordinary dividends or stock dividends; the effect of corporate reorganizations or restructuring, spinoff, or a sale of a business
unit; and other items as the Committee determines to be required so that the operating results of Walmart, a division, or an Affiliate
shall be computed on a comparative basis from Performance Period to Performance Period; in each case as those terms are defined
under generally accepted accounting principles and provided in each case that such excluded items are objectively determinable by
reference to Walmart’s financial statements, notes to Walmart’s financial statements, and/or management’s discussion and analysis
in Walmart’s financial statements. Determination by the Committee or its designee shall be final and conclusive on all parties, but

determines may be a Covered Employee at the time Walmart or an Affiliate would be entitled to a deduction for such Plan Award,
which is intended to provide “qualified performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m). For any
Performance Period for which a Plan Award is intended to be a Qualified Performance Based Award, Performance Goals shall be
established by the Committee no later than 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period to which the Performance Goals

8.2, may result in payment to the Recipient in Shares or cash upon, but not before, the lapse of Restrictions related thereto. To the
extent that Notices of Plan Award granted prior to the 2013 Restatement use the term “Restricted Stock Right,” the term “Restricted
Stock Right” as used in such Notices of Plan Award shall, without formal amendment, be deemed to refer to Restricted Stock Units
(as defined above) payable in Shares. To the extent that Notices of Plan Award granted prior to the 2013 Restatement use the term
“Restricted Stock Unit,” the term “Restricted Stock Unit” as used in such Notices of Plan Award shall, without formal amendment,
be deemed to refer to Restricted Stock Units (as defined above) to be settled in cash.
2.30 “ Restriction” means any restriction on a Recipient’s free enjoyment of the Shares or other rights underlying a Plan Award.
Restrictions may be based on the passage of time or the satisfaction of performance criteria or the occurrence of one or more events
or conditions, and shall lapse separately or in combination upon such conditions and at such time or times, in installments or
otherwise, as the Committee shall specify. Plan Awards subject to a Restriction shall be forfeited if the Restriction does not lapse

SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

3.1
Shares Subject to the Plan. Subject to Section 11.9, the sum of (a) 50,000,000 Shares plus (b) the number of remaining
Shares under the 2005 Plan (not subject to outstanding Plan Awards and not delivered out of Shares reserved thereunder) as of the
date of stockholder approval of the Plan (collectively, the “Subject Shares”) are reserved for delivery under the Plan. The Subject
Shares may be authorized, but unissued Shares, treasury Shares held by Walmart or an Affiliate, or Shares acquired on the open
6

market, including shares acquired on the open market by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will purchase Shares on
behalf, and in the name of the Recipient. Shares reserved for delivery pursuant to a Plan Award or any rights thereto that expire, are
forfeited or otherwise are no longer exercisable may be the subject of a new Plan Award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Shares already owned by a Recipient and used to pay all or a portion of the exercise price of
Shares subject to an Option, and (b) any other Shares reacquired by Walmart after such Shares have been issued (or, in the case of
Open Market Shares, have been delivered), other than Restricted Stock that is forfeited or reacquired by Walmart without lapse of
the Restrictions, shall not become Subject Shares to the extent such Shares are withheld, tendered, or reacquired by Walmart, or are
otherwise no longer exercisable. For avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) when Stock Appreciation Rights are
settled in shares, the full number exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, (ii) when Options are “net exercised,” the full number
exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, and (iii) shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations shall cease to be Subject
Shares.
3.2 Limits on Shares. No Recipient may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a number of Shares in
any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares granted to such
Recipient in the same Fiscal Year would exceed 2,000,000 Shares; provided, however, that if the Performance Period applicable to a
Plan Award exceeds twelve months, the 2,000,000 Share limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. If a
Plan Award denominated in Shares is cancelled, the cancelled Plan Award continues to count against the maximum number of
Shares for which a Plan Award denominated in Shares may be granted to a Recipient in any Fiscal Year. The Share limit shall be
adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect adjustments to Shares required by Section 11.9.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Non-Management Director may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a
number of Shares in any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares
granted to such Non-Management Director in the same Fiscal Year would exceed a Share value of $500,000; provided, however, that
if the Performance Period applicable to a Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director exceeds twelve months, the $500,000
limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. For sake of clarity, the $500,000 annual limit on Shares subject
to any Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director applies to Options granted under Section 6.1, Stock granted under
Section 7.1, Restricted Stock granted under Section 7.2, Restricted Stock Units granted under Section 8.1, Stock Appreciation Rights
granted under Section 9.1, and Performance Units granted under Section 10.1, but shall not include any Shares granted in lieu of
cash compensation earned by a Non-Management Director or any Shares received by a Non-Management Director in settlement a
Plan Award pursuant to Sections 6.3, 7.4, 8.3, 9.5, and 10.6.
ADMINISTRATION
4.1 Administration. The Committee will administer the Plan and will grant all Plan Awards; provided that solely for purposes of
granting Plan Awards to Non-Management Directors, “Committee” shall mean the full Board. The Plan and Plan Awards to
Section 16 Persons shall be administered by the Committee in compliance with Rule 16b-3.
4.2

Duties and Powers. The Committee shall have these duties and powers as to the Plan:
7

(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)

(h)

(i)
(j)

to establish rules, procedures, and forms governing the Plan;
to interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and any Plan Award;
to recommend amendments of the Plan to the Board;
to determine those individuals who will be Recipients and what Plan Awards will be made to them;
to set the terms and conditions of any Plan Award and to determine and certify whether, and the extent to which, any such
terms and conditions have been satisfied;
to determine the Fair Market Value of the Shares for any purpose;
to amend the terms of any Plan Award without the consent of the Recipient or any other person or to waive any conditions or
obligations of a Recipient under or with respect to any Plan Award; provided that no amendment that, in the judgment of the
Committee would materially adversely affect the Recipient shall be made without the Recipient’s consent; provided further
that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of the Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the
Recipient;
to make such adjustments or modifications to Plan Awards to Recipients who are working outside the United States as are
advisable to fulfill the purposes of the Plan or to comply with applicable local law and to establish, amend and terminate subplans for individuals outside the United States with such provisions as are consistent with the Plan as may be suitable in other
jurisdictions to the extent permitted under local law;
to correct any defect or supply any omission; and
take any other action it deems necessary or advisable.

Notwithstanding the authority of the Committee under this Section 4.2 and notwithstanding any other discretionary power granted to
the Committee under the Plan, except in connection with any corporate transaction involving Walmart, the terms of outstanding Plan
Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel outstanding
Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Plan Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an
exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights without the prior approval of
Walmart stockholders.
4.3
Delegation. Except for the administration of Qualified Performance Based Awards and matters under the Plan affected by
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules adopted thereunder, the Committee may delegate ministerial duties under the Plan
(including but not limited to the duties described in Section 4.2(h)) to one or more administrators, who may be Associates of
Walmart, and may delegate non-ministerial duties to an officer of Walmart; provided that the delegate of non-ministerial duties shall
not be authorized to make Plan Awards to himself or herself.
The Committee has delegated its powers, duties, and authority under the Plan (including the power to delegate, but not including the
power to recommend amendments under Section 4.2(c)) with respect to Associates who are not Section 16 Persons, and other than
Covered Employees whose awards are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, to the Global Compensation Committee
of the Board.
The Board may also delegate administration of the Plan or a particular feature of the Plan to another Committee of the Board.
8

Any delegated authority, duty or power may be revoked at any time by the delegator as it deems appropriate. Any delegated
authority, duty or power may be exercised by the delegator as well as the delegate; provided, however, that in the event of any
conflict between the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the delegator and the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the
delegate, the exercise by the delegator shall govern.
4.4 Determinations Binding. All actions taken or determinations made by the Committee, in good faith, with respect to the Plan,
a Plan Award or any Notice of Plan Award shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
all persons interested in the Plan or any Plan Award.
PARTICIPATION
5.1 All Associates and Non-Management Directors who the Committee determines have the potential to contribute significantly to
the success of Walmart or an Affiliate, are eligible to participate in the Plan, except that Non-Management Directors may not receive
Incentive Stock Options. An Associate may be granted one or more Plan Awards, unless prohibited by applicable law and subject to
the limitations under Code Section 422 with respect to Incentive Stock Options. For any Performance Period for which Plan Awards
are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the Committee shall designate the Associates eligible to be granted Plan
Awards no later than the 90th day of the Fiscal Year (or in the case of a Performance Period other than a Fiscal Year, after not later
than the date 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed).
STOCK OPTIONS
6.1
Term of Options. Walmart may grant Options covering Subject Shares to Associates and Non-Management Directors. The
term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock
Option, the term shall be no more than 10 years from the date of grant unless the Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Recipient
who, at the time of the grant, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any
Parent/Subsidiary Corporation, in which case the term may not exceed 5 years from the date of grant.
Each Option shall be a Nonqualified Option unless designated otherwise in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding the
designation of an Option, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares subject to Incentive Stock Options that are exercisable for the
first time by a Recipient during a calendar year exceeds $100,000 (whether due to the terms of the Plan Award, acceleration of
exercisability, miscalculation or error), or if such Option for any other reason fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the excess
Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options.
6.2 Option Exercise Price and Consideration. The per Share exercise price of an Option shall be determined by the Committee
in its discretion, except that the per Share exercise price for an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the date of grant except that, with respect to an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Associate who owns stock
representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any Parent/Subsidiary Corporation at the time
of the grant, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. The type
of consideration in which the exercise price of an Option is to be paid shall be determined by the
9

Committee in its discretion, and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant.
6.3 Exercise of Options. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when the person entitled to exercise the Option gives notice
of exercise to Walmart in accordance with the Option’s terms and Walmart receives full payment for the Shares as to which the
Option is exercised or other provision for such payment is made in accordance with rules and procedures established by the
Committee from time to time. Except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, such rules and procedures may include procedures for
a “net-share settlement” method of exercise, under which, subject to the method requirements in the rules and procedures, the
Recipient provides an irrevocable notice of exercise of the Option and Walmart retains a number of Shares sufficient to cover the
exercise price and the minimum required withholding, and delivers the net number of Shares to the Recipient. In addition, if
determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among Recipients or Plan Awards, an Option will
be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the
Recipient’s Option under Section 11.6) on the expiration date of the Option, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the
last day prior to the expiration date on which the NYSE is open, using a net share settlement method of exercise to the extent that as
of such expiration date the Option is vested and exercisable and the per Share exercise price of the Option is below the Fair Market
Value of a Share on such expiration date.
6.4 Termination of Employment. If a Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, the Recipient
may exercise Options that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date to the extent set out in the Recipient’s Notice of
Plan Award. Incentive Stock Options may be exercised only within 60 days (or other period of time determined by the Committee at
the time of grant of the Option and not exceeding 3 months) after the date of the termination (but in no event later than the expiration
date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), and only to the extent that Recipient was entitled to exercise
the Incentive Stock Option at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not exercise an Option
at the date of that termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan Award, the Option shall terminate. In
addition, the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the
existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with,
or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the
tolling period will end and the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the
exercise date of an Option be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status plus
the tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding any provision in
the Plan to the contrary, an Associate’s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate’s Options if immediately
upon the termination of the Associate’s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate the Associate becomes a NonManagement Director.
6.5
Administrative Suspension from Employment. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative
suspension from employment, the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be suspended. If upon the conclusion of the
administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be reinstated
10

subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of an Option be
later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award.
6.6 Disability of Recipient. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4, in the case of an Associate’s Incentive Stock Option,
if the Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated as a result of his or her total and permanent disability (as defined in Code Section
22(e)(3)), the Recipient may, but only within 12 months from the date of that termination (but in no event later than the expiration
date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), exercise an Incentive Stock Option to the extent otherwise
entitled to exercise it at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to exercise an Incentive Stock Option
at the date of termination, or if Recipient does not exercise that Incentive Stock Option to the extent so entitled within the time
specified herein, the Incentive Stock Option shall terminate.
6.7
Non-transferability of Options . An Option may not be sold, pledged, hedged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or
disposed of in any manner except by testamentary devise or by the laws of descent or distribution or, in those circumstances
expressly permitted by the Committee, to a Permitted Transferee. For this purpose, a “Permitted Transferee” means any member of
the Immediate Family of the Recipient, any trust of which all of the primary beneficiaries are the Recipient or members of his or her
Immediate Family or any partnership of which all of the partners or members are the Recipient or members of his or her Immediate
Family. The “Immediate Family” of a Recipient means the Recipient’s spouse, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents,
stepparents, siblings, grandparents, nieces and nephews, or the spouse of any of the foregoing individuals.
6.8 Withholding. The Committee may withhold, or provide for the payment of, any amounts necessary to collect any withholding
taxes upon any taxable event relating to an Option in accordance with Section 11.10 except to the extent otherwise provided under
Section 6.3.
SHARES AND RESTRICTED STOCK
7.1 Grant of Shares. Walmart may grant Shares without Restrictions or payment to those Non-Management Directors as the full
Board may determine in its sole discretion.
7.2
Grant of Restricted Stock. Walmart may grant Restricted Stock to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as the
Committee may select in its sole discretion. Each Plan Award of Restricted Stock shall have those terms and conditions that are
expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and any other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in its
discretion.
7.3
Dividends; Voting. While any Restriction applies to any Recipient’s Restricted Stock, (a) unless the Committee provides
otherwise, the Recipient shall receive the dividends paid on the Restricted Stock and shall not be required to return those dividends
to Walmart in the event of the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock, (b) the Recipient shall have the right to, subject to all Restrictions
then existing as to the Recipient’s Restricted Stock, receive the proceeds of the Restricted Stock in any stock split, reverse stock
split, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of Walmart, which proceeds shall automatically and without need for
any other action become Restricted Stock and be delivered as provided in Section 7.4, and (c) the Recipient shall be entitled to vote
the Restricted Stock during the Restriction period.
7.4

Delivery of Shares. Subject to any deferral election under Section 7.8, a Share will be
11

delivered to the Recipient upon, or as soon as practicable after, the lapse of the Restrictions on a Share of Restricted Stock. Shares
awarded under Section 7.1 shall be delivered immediately upon issuance of any such Plan Award. During the period of Restriction
applicable to Restricted Stock, the Recipient shall not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any
security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Restricted Stock or any interest therein. As a result of
the retention of rights in the Restricted Stock by Walmart, except as required by any law, neither any Shares of the Restricted Stock
nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge,
hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the
direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any
bankruptcy or other creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
7.5
Forfeiture. Unless expressly provided for in the Plan Award, any Restricted Stock held by the Recipient at the time the
Recipient ceases to be an Associate or Non-Management Director for any reason shall be forfeited by the Recipient to Walmart and
automatically re-conveyed to Walmart.
7.6
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to a Plan Award or the exercise or settlement thereof.
7.7 Evidence of Share Ownership. The Restricted Stock will be book-entry Shares held for the benefit of the Recipient with stop
transfer instructions on Walmart’s stop transfer records until the Restrictions lapse, at which time Walmart will remove stop transfer
instructions from the Shares on its stock transfer records.
7.8 Deferral of Shares or Restricted Stock. At the time of grant of Shares or Restricted Stock (or at such earlier or later time as
the Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit a Recipient
of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to defer his or her Stock or Restricted Stock in accordance with rules
and procedures established by the Committee. Alternatively, the Committee may, in its discretion and at the times provided above,
permit an individual who would have been a Recipient of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to elect
instead to receive an equivalent Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units to be settled in Shares and may permit the Recipient to elect to
defer receipt of Shares under such Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section 8.7.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
8.1
Grant of Restricted Stock Units. Walmart may grant Restricted Stock Units to those Associates and Non-Management
Directors as the Committee may select in its sole discretion. Each Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units shall have those terms and
conditions that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and the Notice of Plan Award, as the Committee may determine
in its discretion. The Restrictions imposed shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A.
8.2
Beneficial Ownership. Until the Restricted Stock Unit is released from Restrictions and settled in Shares or cash, the
Recipient shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares
12

subject to the Restricted Stock Unit, nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant
any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Restricted Stock Unit or any interest therein. Except
as required by any law, no Restricted Stock Unit nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary
sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or
obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any
proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any
transaction of that type shall be void.
8.3
Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Upon the lapse of the Restrictions, the Recipient of Restricted Stock Units shall,
except as noted below, be entitled to receive, as soon as administratively practical, (a) that number of Shares subject to the Plan
Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, (b) in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of Shares
subject to the Plan Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee
shall determine in its sole discretion and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. Where in the judgment of the Committee, it is
in the interests of Walmart to do so, a grant of Restricted Stock Units may provide that Walmart or an Affiliate may purchase Shares
on the open market on behalf of a Recipient in accordance with Section 11.1 (“Open Market Shares”).
8.4 Forfeiture. Restricted Stock Units and the entitlement to Shares, cash, or any combination thereunder will be forfeited and all
rights of an Associate or Non-Management Director to such Restricted Stock Units and the Shares thereunder will terminate if the
applicable Restrictions are not satisfied.
8.5 Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Restricted Stock Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting
rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan. The Committee may, however, provide in the
Notice of Plan Award that the Recipient shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalent payments on Restricted Stock Units, on such
terms and conditions as the Notice of Plan Award shall specify.
8.6
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Restricted Stock Units.
8.7
Deferral of Restricted Stock Units . At the time of grant of Restricted Stock Units (or at such earlier or later time as the
Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to
elect to defer receipt of the Shares or cash to be delivered upon lapse of the Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units in
accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax
treatment under Code Section 409A, and may provide for payment in Shares or cash.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
9.1 Grant. Walmart may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as the Committee
selects in its sole discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. A Recipient granted a Stock Appreciation
Right will be entitled to receive payment as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award in an amount equal to (a) the excess of the Fair
Market Value of a Share on the date on which the Recipient properly
13

exercises Stock Appreciation Rights that are no longer subject to Restrictions over the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of
grant of the Recipient’s Stock Appreciation Rights, (b) a predetermined amount that is less than that excess, or (c) with respect to
Recipients who are exempt from U.S. taxation and who are expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan Award is
settled, any other amount as may be set by the Committee, multiplied by the number of Stock Appreciation Rights as to which the
Recipient exercises the Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee may provide that payment with respect to an exercised Stock
Appreciation Right may occur on a date which is different than the exercise date, and may provide for additional payment in
recognition of the time value of money and any delay between the exercise date and the payment date.
9.2
Award Vesting and Forfeiture. The Committee shall establish the Restrictions, if any, applicable to Stock Appreciation
Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights and the entitlement to Shares thereunder will be forfeited and all rights of the Recipient to such
Stock Appreciation Rights and the Shares thereunder will terminate if any applicable Restrictions in the Plan or Notice of Plan
Award are not satisfied.
9.3 Beneficial Ownership. The Recipient of any Stock Appreciation Rights shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares
subject to such Plan Awards until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Plan Award nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell,
transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any
Stock Appreciation Rights or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Stock Appreciation Rights nor any
interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation,
encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect
result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other
creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
9.4
Election to Receive Payments. A Recipient of a Stock Appreciation Right may elect to receive a payment to which the
Recipient is entitled under the Plan Award by giving notice of such election to the Committee in accordance with the rules
established by the Committee. In addition, if determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among
Recipients or Plan Awards, a Stock Appreciation Right will be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the
Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the Recipient’s Stock Appreciation Right under Section 11.6) on the expiration
date of the Stock Appreciation Right, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the last day prior to the expiration date on
which the NYSE is open, to the extent that as of such expiration date the Stock Appreciation Right is vested and exercisable and to
the extent that, if the Recipient exercised such Stock Appreciation Right, the Recipient would receive a payment under Section 9.5.
9.5
Payments to Recipients. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan Award granting the Stock Appreciation
Rights, a payment to a Recipient with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights may be made (a) in cash, (b) in Shares having an
aggregate Fair Market Value on the date on which the Stock Appreciation Rights are settled equal to the amount of the payment to
be made under the Plan Award, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion
and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. The Committee shall not make any payment in Shares if such payment would
result in
14

any adverse tax or other legal effect as to this Plan or Walmart.
9.6
Termination of Continuous Status. If a Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, then,
Recipient may elect payment with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date
to the extent set out in the Recipient’s Notice of Plan Award. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not elect payment
with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right at the date of termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan
Award, the Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate. In addition, the Recipient’s right to exercise Stock Appreciation Rights will be
tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of
whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient’s
Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the tolling period will end and the Recipient’s right to elect
payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of a Stock
Appreciation Right be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status plus the
tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding
any provision in the Plan to the contrary, an Associate’s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate’s Stock
Appreciation Rights if immediately upon the termination of the Associate’s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate
the Associate becomes a Non-Management Director.
9.7
Administrative Suspension from Employment. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative
suspension from employment, the Recipient’s right to elect payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be suspended. If upon the
conclusion of the administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient’s right to elect payment of
Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no
event will the date of the payment election be later than the expiration date of the term of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in
the Notice of Plan Award.
9.8
Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Stock Appreciation Rights is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g.,
voting rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan.
9.9
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to the Stock Appreciation Rights.
9.10 Deferral of Stock Appreciation Rights. At the time of grant of a Plan Award of Stock Appreciation Rights the Committee
may permit a Recipient who is exempt from U.S. taxation and who is expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan
Award is settled to elect to defer the Shares or cash to be delivered in settlement of a Stock Appreciation Right in accordance with
rules and procedures established by the Committee.
PERFORMANCE UNITS
10.1 Grant. Walmart may grant Performance Units to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as it may select in its sole
discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. Each Plan Award of Performance Units shall have those
terms and conditions
15

that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and Notice of Plan Award.
10.2
Performance Goals. The Committee shall set Performance Goals which, depending on the extent to which they are met
during a Performance Period, will determine the number of Performance Units that will be earned by the Recipient at the end of the
Performance Period. The Performance Goals shall be set at threshold, target and maximum performance levels, with the number of
Performance Units to be earned tied to the degree of attainment of the various performance levels under the various Performance
Goals during the Performance Period. No Performance Units will be earned if the threshold performance level is not attained.
10.3 Beneficial Ownership. The Recipient of Performance Units shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares subject to
the Performance Units unless and until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Performance Units nor shall the Recipient have the
right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hedge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose
of or encumber any Performance Units or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Performance Units nor any
interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hypothecation,
encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect
result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other
creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
10.4
Determination of Achievement of Performance Goals. The Committee shall, promptly after the date on which the
necessary financial, individual or other information for a particular Performance Period becomes available, determine and certify the
degree to which each of the Performance Goals have been attained.
10.5 Settlement of Performance Units. After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the Recipient of Performance Units
shall be entitled to payment based on the performance level attained with respect to the Performance Goals applicable to the
Performance Units. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce, eliminate or increase any amount of Shares or cash earned
under Performance Units for any individual or group, except that such amount of Shares or cash intended to be a Qualified
Performance Based Award may not be increased above the amount provided in the Notice of Plan Award. Unless deferred in
accordance with Section 10.9, Performance Units shall be settled as soon as practicable after the Committee determines and certifies
the degree of attainment of Performance Goals for the Performance Period.
The Committee shall have the discretion and authority to make adjustments to any Performance Units in circumstances where,
during the Performance Period: (a) a Recipient leaves Walmart or an Affiliate and is subsequently rehired; (b) a Recipient transfers
between positions with different incentive percentages or Performance Goals; (c) a Recipient transfers to a position not eligible to
participate in the Plan; (d) a Recipient becomes eligible, or ceases to be eligible, for an incentive from another incentive plan
maintained by Walmart or an Affiliate; (e) a Recipient is on a leave of absence; and (f) similar circumstances deemed appropriate by
the Committee, consistent with the purpose and terms of the Plan; provided however, that the Committee shall not be authorized to
increase the amount of Performance Units payable to a Covered Employee that would otherwise be payable if the amount was
intended to be Qualified Performance Based Award.
10.6

Payments to Recipients. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan
16

Award, payment to a Recipient with respect to Performance Units may be made (a) in Shares, (b) in cash or by check equal to the
Shares’ Fair Market Value on the date the Performance Units are settled, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the
Committee shall determine at any time in its sole discretion.
10.7
Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Performance Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting
rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of Shares pursuant to the settlement of the Plan Award (if the Plan Award is settled in
Shares). No dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to Performance Units.
10.8
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Performance Units.
10.9
Deferral of Shares or Cash Payout. At the time of grant of Performance Units (or at such earlier or later time as the
Committee determines to be appropriate in light of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to elect to defer
delivery of Shares (or payment of cash) with respect to the Plan Award in accordance with such rules and procedures established by
the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A.
MISCELLANEOUS
11.1

Issuance of Stock Certificates; Book-Entry; or Purchase of Shares.

(a)

If a Recipient has the right to the delivery of any Shares pursuant to any Plan Award, Walmart shall issue or cause to be
issued a stock certificate or a book-entry crediting Shares to the Recipient’s account promptly upon the exercise of the Plan
Award or the right arising under the Plan Award.

(b)

A Recipient’s right to Open Market Shares pursuant to settlement of a Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units or Performance
Units shall not be satisfied by Walmart’s delivery of Shares but rather Walmart or an Affiliate shall purchase the Shares on
the open market on behalf of the Recipient by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares
on the open market on behalf of the Recipient.

11.2

Compliance with Code Section 162(m).

(a)

To the extent awards to Covered Employees are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the material terms of
the Performance Goals under which awards are paid (and any material changes in material terms) shall be disclosed to and
approved by Walmart’s stockholders in a separate vote. Material terms include the eligible Recipients specified in Section
5.1, the Performance Measures pursuant to which the Performance Goals are set, and the maximum amount of compensation
that could be paid to any Covered Employee or the formula used to calculate the amount of compensation to be paid to the
Covered Employee if the Performance Goal is attained.

(b)

Performance Measures must be disclosed to and reapproved by the stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting
that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which stockholders previously approved the Performance Measures. If
applicable laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without conditioning
deductibility on obtaining stockholder approval (or reapproval) of any
17

changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make changes without obtaining stockholder approval or
reapproval.
(c)

Whenever the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant or pay awards that do not qualify as Qualified Performance
Based Awards, the Committee may make grants or payments without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m).

(d)

The Committee may, but shall not be required to, establish rules and procedures providing for the automatic deferral of
Shares or other Plan payouts of Recipients who are Covered Employees as necessary to avoid a loss of deduction under Code
Section 162(m)(1).

11.3
Termination of Employment or Interruption or Termination of Continuous Status. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in the Plan, the Committee shall determine the effect of the termination of an Associate’s employment, or a Recipient’s
disability or death, or any other interruption or termination of Continuous Status, on the lapse of any Restrictions contained in a Plan
Award made to the Recipient. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative suspension, a Recipient’s right to
exercise or receive payment for any rights under any Plan Award or the vesting of any rights under any Plan Award shall be
suspended to the extent permitted under local law.
11.4
Forfeiture for Cause. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, any Recipient upon a finding of
“Cause” by the Committee shall forfeit all Plan Awards (and rights thereunder) granted under the Plan, whether or not vested or
otherwise exercisable.
11.5

Repayment Obligation.

(a)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, in the event the Committee or its delegate (which expressly
may include any officer of Walmart or a non-Associate third party (such as counsel to Walmart)) determines that a Recipient
has engaged in Gross Misconduct, then the Recipient shall forfeit all Plan Awards then outstanding, and the Recipient shall
repay to Walmart any payments received from Walmart with respect to any Plan Awards subsequent to the date which is
twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of the behavior serving as the basis for the finding of Gross Misconduct. Any
amount to be repaid by a Recipient pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be held by the Recipient in constructive trust for the
benefit of Walmart and shall be paid by the Recipient to Walmart with interest at the prime rate (as published in The Wall
Street Journal ) as of the date the Committee or its delegate determines the Recipient engaged in Gross Misconduct. The
amount to be repaid pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be determined on a gross basis, without reduction for any taxes
incurred, as of the date of payment to the Recipient, and without regard to any subsequent change in the Fair Market Value of
a Share.

(b)

If the Committee determines at any time that the Recipient of a Plan Award, prior to or within one year after the date of
settlement of such Plan Award, (A) engaged in any act the Committee deems inimical to the best interest of Walmart or an
Affiliate, (B) breached any restrictive covenant or confidentiality requirement to which the Recipient was subject; or (C)
otherwise failed to comply with applicable policies of Walmart or an Affiliate at all times prior to the settlement of the Plan
Award, the Recipient shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the amount paid or distributed in settlement of such Plan
Award to Walmart. In addition, all Plan Awards, whether or not previously settled,
18

and whether or not previously deferred, shall be subject to Walmart’s policies, including Walmart’s Statement of Ethics or
requirements of applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance) regarding clawbacks (recoupment) as in
effect from time to time.
11.6
Death of Recipient. To the extent permitted in the Notice of Plan Award or under Committee rules and procedures, a
Recipient may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid, or who is authorized to
exercise the Recipient’s Plan Award, in the event of the death of the Recipient, subject to Committee rules and procedures. If no
such beneficiary is effectively named by the Recipient for any reason, then except to the extent otherwise provided in the Notice of
Plan Award or Committee rules and procedures, if the Recipient dies, the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid to the Recipient’s
estate or may be exercised, in accordance with its terms or as allowed by law, by the Recipient’s estate or by the beneficiary or
person to whom the award devolves by bequest or inheritance. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice of Plan Award, (a) Plan
Awards may be exercised after death only to the extent the Recipient was otherwise entitled to exercise the Plan Award at the date of
the Recipient’s death and only if exercised within 12 months after the Recipient’s death, and (b) to the extent a Plan Award was
unvested at the date of death, the Plan Award shall terminate.
11.7
Limitations on Liability and Award Obligations. Receiving a Plan Award or being the owner of any Option, Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Stock Appreciation Right, or Performance Unit shall not:
(a)

give a Recipient any rights except as expressly set forth in the Plan or in the Plan Award and except as a stockholder of
Walmart as set forth herein as to the Restricted Stock only;

(b)

as to Shares deliverable on the exercise of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or in settlement of Performance Units or
Restricted Stock Units, until the delivery (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of Walmart of a duly authorized
transfer agent of Walmart) of such Shares, give the Recipient the right to vote, or receive dividends on, or exercise any other
rights as a stockholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise (in the case of Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights) of the related Plan Award;

(c)

be considered a contract of employment or give the Recipient any right to continued employment, or to hold any position,
with Walmart or any Affiliate;

(d)

create any fiduciary or other obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to take any action or provide to the Recipient any
assistance or dedicate or permit the use of any assets of Walmart or any Affiliate that would permit the Recipient to be able to
attain any performance criteria stated in the Recipient’s Plan Award;

(e)

create any trust, fiduciary or other duty or obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to engage in any particular business,
continue to engage in any particular business, engage in any particular business practices or sell any particular product or
products;

(f)

create any obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate that shall be greater than the obligations of Walmart or that Affiliate to any
general unsecured creditor of Walmart or the Affiliate; or

(g)

give a Recipient any right to receive any additional Plan Award of any type.
19

If Walmart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient’s employment with Walmart or the Affiliate, the potential value of any Plan Award
that must be returned to Walmart will not be an element of any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination of
employment or other relationship in violation of any contractual or other rights the Recipient may have.
11.8 No Liability of Committee Members. Walmart shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each
other officer and director of Walmart or any Affiliate that has any duty or power relating to the administration of the Plan against any
liability, obligation, cost or expense incurred by that person arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan or
any Plan Award if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of
Walmart. Indemnification of Associates, directors, and agents shall be determined pursuant to the requirements of Article VI of
Walmart’s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
11.9 Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger. Subject to any required action by the Walmart stockholders, the
number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) covered by each Plan Award, and the number and type of Shares (or other
securities or property) which have been authorized for delivery under the Plan but as to which no Plan Awards have yet been granted
or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of a Plan Award, the price per Share covered by any
outstanding Plan Award that includes in its terms a price per Share, and the number of Shares with respect to which Plan Awards
may be granted to an individual shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect an extraordinary dividend or other distribution (whether
in the form of cash, Shares or other securities or property), stock split, reverse stock split, merger, reorganization, subdivision,
consolidation or reduction of capital, recapitalization, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or reclassification of the Shares,
or any other increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by Walmart, issuance
or warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of Walmart or other similar corporate transaction or event that
affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. That adjustment shall be made by the
Committee, whose determination shall be final, binding and conclusive as to every person interested under the Plan. Except as
expressly provided herein, no issuance by Walmart of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of
any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to a
Plan Award.
11.10 Tax Withholding. Whenever taxes are to be withheld in connection with the grant, vesting, lapse of restrictions, exercise or
settlement of a Plan Award or for any other reason in connection with a Plan Award (the date on which such withholding obligation
arises being hereinafter referred to as the “Tax Date”), the Committee may decide, in its sole discretion, to provide for the payment
for the withholding of federal, state and local taxes (including Social Security and Medicare (“FICA”) taxes by one or a combination
of the following methods and may (but need not) permit the Recipient to elect the method or methods: (a) payment in cash of the
amount to be withheld, (b) requesting Walmart to withhold from Shares that would otherwise be delivered in settlement of a Plan
Award payable in Shares (or upon the lapse of Restrictions on a Plan Award) a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the
Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date no greater than the amount to be withheld, (c) transfer of
20

unencumbered Shares owned by the Recipient in circumstances permitted by the Committee valued at their Fair Market Value on the
Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date, (d) withholding from any cash compensation otherwise due to the
Recipient; or (e) such other method as authorized by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee may set limits on the amount of
withholding to be satisfied through withholding of Shares; e.g., the Committee may require that only the minimum withholding be
satisfied in Shares, and may prohibit withholding from Open Market Shares or using a particular method if necessary or advisable in
a particular country. Any fractional share amount must be paid in cash or withheld from compensation otherwise due to the
Recipient.
11.11 Amendment and Termination of the Plan. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time without the approval
of the Recipients or any other person, except to the extent any action of that type is required to be approved by the stockholders of
Walmart under applicable law, listing standards, or in connection with any outstanding Qualified Performance Based Awards.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment that, in the judgment of the Board would materially adversely affect a Recipient
holding an Award shall be made without the Recipient’s consent; provided that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of
a Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the Recipient.
11.12 Compliance with Law. The making of any Plan Award or delivery of any Shares is subject to compliance by Walmart with
all applicable laws as determined by Walmart’s legal counsel. Walmart need not issue or transfer any Plan Award or Shares pursuant
to the Plan unless Walmart’s legal counsel has approved all legal matters in connection with the delivery of any Plan Award or
Shares.
11.13 No Representation or Warranty Regarding Tax Treatment. Notwithstanding any language contained in the Plan or any
Plan Award, Walmart does not represent or warrant that any particular tax treatment will be achieved.
11.14

Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

11.15 Superseding Existing Plans, Effective Date, and Transition. The Plan, as set forth herein, was approved by the Board on
February 6, 2015, to be effective on June 5, 2015, subject to the approval of Walmart’s stockholders. The 2013 Restatement was
approved by the Board on April 12, 2013, to be effective August 12, 2013. The 2010 Plan was effective January 1, 2010, and
approved by Walmart’s stockholders on June 4, 2010. The 2005 Plan was effective January 1, 2005, and was approved by Walmart’s
stockholders on June 3, 2005. The 1998 Plan was effective as of March 5, 1998, and was approved by Walmart’s stockholders on
June 5, 1998. Shares made available for delivery in settlement of Plan Awards shall also be available for delivery in settlement of
amounts payable under the provisions of the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Director Compensation Deferral Plan.
11.16
Funding. To the extent the Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), it is
intended to be (and will be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly
compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. It is intended that the Plan be unfunded for federal tax purposes and for
purposes of Title I of ERISA.
11.17 Code Section 409A. Plan Awards are intended to be exempt from the definition of “nonqualified deferred compensation”
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, or to the extent
21

not so exempt, to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the Plan and Plan Awards shall be interpreted accordingly.

2. Plan Governs . The Restricted Stock and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are accepting
the Restricted Stock, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the

3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the Restricted Stock or the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock granted to you
pursuant to this Agreement.
4.
Stockholder Rights . Your Restricted Stock will be held for you by Walmart until the applicable delivery date described in
Paragraph 5. You shall have all the rights of a stockholder of Shares of Restricted Stock that vest. With respect to your unvested
Restricted Stock:

A.
you shall have the right to vote the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock on any matter as to which Shares have
voting rights at any meeting of shareholders of Walmart;
B.
you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting restrictions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes) all cash
dividends paid with respect to such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock; and
C.
any non-cash dividends and other non-cash proceeds of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock, including
stock dividends and any other securities issued or distributed in respect of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock shall
be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture conditions as are applicable to your Restricted Stock, and the term “Restricted
Stock,” as used in this Agreement, shall also include any related stock dividends and other securities issued or distributed in
respect of such Shares underlying your Restricted Stock.
5.

Vesting of Restricted Stock and Delivery of Shares .
A.

Vesting . Your Restricted Stock will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition described
below:
Percentage of
Restricted Stock Vesting

Vesting Date

B.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Restricted Stock, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled
to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of vested Restricted Stock, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax
withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible,
but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date. Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or
other third party designated by Walmart. You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party
designated by Walmart.
6.
Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock that would otherwise
vest in whole or in part on a Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.

your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in Paragraph
8 below); or

B.

You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
2

Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this
Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to
Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination
Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash
dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the
forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Restricted Stock may be
suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at
the end of the administrative suspension period, your Restricted Stock may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further
rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for
which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in
good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Restricted Stock will resume as provided
in Paragraph 5, and any Restricted Stock that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the
number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in
any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes
of this Paragraph 7.
8.

Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability .

A.
Your Restricted Stock that would have become vested on a Vesting Date not more than 90 days after the date your
Continuous Status is so terminated by reason of your death or Disability will become vested earlier than described in Paragraph 5
above, and such earlier vesting date shall be considered a Vesting Date for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the date on which your employment
or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability.
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated due to your Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global
Equity team. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the
long-term disability plan or policy, as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs
you (the “Employer”), regardless of whether you are covered by such policy. If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have
a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities
and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not
less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. You shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability for purpose of
this Paragraph 8 unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmart in its sole discretion.
3

C.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has
not received notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to
process the settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9.

Deferral of Restricted Stock.

A.
Mandatory Deferral . If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of Restricted
Stock in any year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of such
Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of
such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section
162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A. However,
if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not
deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election
and the Deferral Procedures.
B.
Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted
Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised
as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .

A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Restricted Stock and
acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. Please see Paragraph 10.F
regarding Section 83(b) elections.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Employer, the ultimate
liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items
related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is and remains your responsibility and
may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer
(a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the
Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of Shares
acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to
structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge
that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related
Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer or their respective agents, at
4

their sole discretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares
to be issued upon settlement of the vested Restricted Stock. In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under
applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the Restricted Stock and
this Agreement, you authorize and direct: (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your
behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be
appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items; and (b) Walmart and/or the
Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding,
including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have
been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are
withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of tax
is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any excess
amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld
amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the
means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply
with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
F.
By accepting this Agreement, you agree not to make a Code Section 83(b) election with respect to this award of
Restricted Stock.
11.
Restricted Stock Not Transferable . The Restricted Stock may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Restricted Stock and the issuance of the underlying Shares.
Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Restricted Stock Award Notification of Award and
Terms and Conditions of Award to the contrary, the grant of Restricted Stock also shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions as set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific
to your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such
country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Restricted Stock Award
5

Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of Restricted Stock is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other
right to receive future grants of Restricted Stock or other awards, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock, even if restricted stock has
been granted in the past;
C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion
of the Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit
in any way the right of Walmart or the Employer, if different, to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor confer upon you
the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, relate
exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your Restricted Stock;
F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, are not
intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
I.
the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, are not part
of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare
benefits or similar payments;
J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the
income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a
director of any Affiliate;
K.
with certainty;

the future value of the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted

6

L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock resulting
from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any);
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), unless otherwise
set forth in this Agreement, your right to vest in the Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that
you are no longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of
service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee
shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including
whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Restricted Stock and the benefits
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock, the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock,
or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any
corporate transaction affecting the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock; and
O.
if you are providing services outside the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
Restricted Stock or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Stock or the subsequent sale of any Shares
acquired upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares acquired upon vesting.
You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to participate in the Plan and
before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart and
any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand
that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home
address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance identification number, passport or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all Restricted Stock or
any other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of
implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by
7

Walmart in the future, which is assisting Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You
understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the
United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list
with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You
authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or
in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in
electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including
any requisite transfer of Data as may be required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data
will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if
you reside outside the United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data,
require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in
writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely
voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status with the Employer will not
be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant
Restricted Stock or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing
or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your
refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.
16.

Other Provisions .

A.
Determinations regarding this Agreement (including, but not limited to, whether an event has occurred resulting in
the forfeiture of or accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock) shall be made by the Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion
and in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan, and all determinations of the Committee shall be final and conclusive and
binding on you and your successors and heirs.
B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force and effect
for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are similarly
situated.
D.
E.
provisions.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law

8

F.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
G.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English language
version of such document will control.
H.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the
Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan
through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party designated by Walmart.
I.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and
the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
J.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any
other Associate.
K.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your
ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the
laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider trading
policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and any applicable
Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
L.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds arising
from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity
located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances
therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that
you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting
requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any Shares
issuable upon vesting of the Restricted Stock prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any
local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of
9

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any
approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or
approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation
to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any
governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend
restrictions upon Shares underlying your vested Restricted Stock and issue “stop transfer” instructions requiring compliance with
applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart shall have
unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or
other laws, rules or regulations applicable to issuance of Shares.

WAL-MART STORES, INC.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
SHARE-SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These Share-Settled Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any applicable special terms and
conditions for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the “Agreement”), contain the terms and
conditions of the Restricted Stock Units or RSUs (as defined in the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the “Plan”))
granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), a Delaware corporation, under the Plan.
All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.
BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING:
1.
Grant of RSUs . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the RSUs, which consist of the right to receive
the number of Shares underlying the RSUs set forth above on the Vesting Date as further set forth in Paragraph 5 below, subject to
certain vesting conditions.
2.
Plan Governs . The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are accepting the
RSUs, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the RSUs and your
participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and of this Agreement. You further agree to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising under the
Plan.
3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the RSUs or the Shares underlying the RSUs granted to you pursuant to this
Agreement.
4.

Stockholder Rights . Unless and until your RSUs vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you:
A.

You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your RSUs;

B.
you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting conditions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes),
dividend equivalent payments made in the form of cash (paid to you in your normal payroll), until the Vesting Date(s) shown
below; and
C.
You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the RSUs. Upon receipt of the
Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and will be
provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart.
5.
Vesting of the RSUs and Delivery of Shares . Your RSUs will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture
Condition (as defined in Paragraph 6 below):
Percentage of RSUs Vesting

Vesting Date

Upon the vesting of your RSUs, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to the
number of vested RSUs, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below.
The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date. Such
Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart. You will be
responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
Furthermore, Walmart or Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle
your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you
hereby acknowledge and agree that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in
respect of the vested RSUs to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any
Shares so purchased on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in this Paragraph 5.
6.
Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the RSUs that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on the
Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.
your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
B.
You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of
this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further
2

conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete, in a
form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and
Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a
Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such RSUs (including any cash dividends related to the RSUs
for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your RSUs may be suspended as
of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the
administrative suspension period, your RSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such
RSUs or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension
period, then the vesting of your RSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any RSUs that would have vested while you were
on administrative suspension will vest and the number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs will be delivered to you as soon
as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be
considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8.

Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability .
A.
Your RSUs that would have become vested on a Vesting Date not more than 90 days after the date your
Continuous Status is so terminated by reason of your death or Disability will become vested earlier than described in
Paragraph 5 above, and such earlier vesting date shall be considered a Vesting Date for purposes of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of your death or the date on
which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of your Disability.
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated due to your Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global
Equity team. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments
under the long-term disability plan or policy, as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the
Employer, regardless of whether you are covered by such policy. If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have a
long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” means that you are unable to carry out the
responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any medically determined physical or mental
impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days. You shall not be considered to have
incurred a Disability for purpose of this Paragraph 8 unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy
Walmart in its sole discretion.
C.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has
not received notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be
necessary to process the
3

settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9.

Deferral .
A.
Mandatory Deferral. If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs in
any year, when considered with your other compensation, would result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of such
Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then Walmart shall defer the
delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be
limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the deferral procedures
established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer
such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such Shares in the First Non162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the deferral procedures
established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
B.
Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock Units . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your
RSU award to a future date in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be
advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.

10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .
A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your RSUs and acknowledge
that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you
(the “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment
on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related
Items”) is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You
further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment
of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or
settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends;
and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the RSUs or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce
or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to TaxRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer,
as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
4

C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all TaxRelated Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested RSUs. In the event that such withholding
in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your
acceptance of the RSUs and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any broker or other third party
designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs that Walmart or
the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related
Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it
authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by
Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you
are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the
Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an
excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory
body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled
to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by
the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to
comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11.
RSUs Not Transferable . The RSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or
encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the RSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation of

and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of RSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendix
attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific to your country. Moreover, if you
relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the
extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
5

reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Terms and Conditions

13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

E.
the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your
Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your RSUs;

the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any

benefits or similar payments;

of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the RSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with
certainty;

no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs resulting from the
termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason

whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are
employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSUs, you agree not
to institute any claim against Walmart, the Employer or any Affiliate;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right
to receive and vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively
providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the
exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including
whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this
Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSUs, the Shares underlying the RSUs, or any such benefits transferred
to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction
affecting the Shares underlying the RSUs; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired
upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the RSUs
acquired upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to
participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart and
any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand
that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home
address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number or other identification number, salary,
nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all RSUs or any other awards granted,
canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and
its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is assisting
7

Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be
located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws
and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential
recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering
and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be
required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to
implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you
may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary
amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human
resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career with the Employer will not be adversely
affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant RSUs or other
Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your
consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

binding on you and your successors and heirs.
B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force
and effect for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are
similarly situated.
D.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.

E.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law
provisions.
8

F.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
G.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English
language version of such document will control.
H.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation
in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to
participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party
designated by Walmart.
I.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and
the Shares underlying the RSUs, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.
J.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you
or any other Associate.
K.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your
ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined
in the laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s
insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations
and any applicable Walmart insider trader policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
L.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds
arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or
legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts,
assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account,
exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement
9

applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any Shares issuable upon vesting of the RSUs prior to the
completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange
control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other
governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign
governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary
or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state
or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of
the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend restrictions upon Shares underlying your
vested RSUs and issue “stop transfer” instructions requiring compliance with applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the
terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the
Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of
Shares.

Terms and Conditions . This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan
if you work and/or reside in one of the countries listed below.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer

discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you .

aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in
effect in the respective countries as of January 2016. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Walmart
strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the
consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the RSUs vest or you
receive Shares under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and Walmart is not
in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the
relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer

contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.

Instead of delivering Shares upon vesting of your RSUs to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C's, Walmart or Wal-Mart
Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a

Notifications
Securities Law Information . You are permitted to sell the Shares acquired through the Plan through the designated broker, if any,
provided the resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on
which the Shares are listed ( i.e. , the NYSE).
Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information . Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive
Shares ( e.g. , RSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a
Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any
time during the year. Thus, RSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded
because of other specified foreign property that you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base
(“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own
other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.
CHILE
Terms and Conditions
Labor Law Acknowledgement . The RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, shall not be

This offer of RSUs is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (“SVS”).
The offer refers to securities not registered at the securities registry or at the foreign securities registry of the SVS, and, therefore,
such securities are not subject to oversight of the SVS. Given that the RSUs are not registered in Chile, Walmart is not required to
provide public information about the RSUs or the Shares in Chile. Unless the RSUs and/or the Shares are registered with the SVS, a
public offering of such securities cannot be made in Chile.
Esta Oferta de RSUs constituye una oferta privada de valores en Chile y se inicia en la Fecha de la Oferta. Esta oferta de RSUs se
acoge a las disposiciones de la Norma de Carácter General Nº 336 (“NCG 336”) de la Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros de
Chile (“SVS”). Esta oferta versa sobre valores no inscritos en el Registro de Valores o en el Registro de Valores Extranjeros que
lleva la SVS, por lo que tales valores no están sujetos a la fiscalización de ésta. Por tratarse de valores no inscritos en Chile no
existe la obligación por parte de Walmart de entregar en Chile información pública respecto de los mismos. Estos valores no
podrán ser objeto de oferta pública en Chile mientras no sean inscritos en el Registro de Valores correspondiente.
4

Exchange Control Information . You are not required to repatriate any funds you receive with respect to the RSUs ( e.g. , any

registered foreign exchange office) if the amount of the funds repatriated exceeds US$10,000. Further, if the value of your aggregate
investments held outside of Chile exceeds US$5,000,000 at any time in a calendar year, you must report the status of such
investments to the Central Bank of Chile.

Terms and Conditions
Taxes and Tax Withholding . This section supplements Paragraph 10 of the T&C’s:
If payment or withholding of the income tax is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the tax year in which the income tax
liability arises or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax Act (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the
“Due Date”), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by you to Walmart or an Affiliate, effective on
the Due Date. You agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and Walmart or an Affiliate may recover it at any time thereafter by the
means referred to in Paragraph 10 of the T&C’s. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of Walmart
(within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), you shall not be eligible for a
loan from Walmart or an Affiliate to cover the income tax. In the event that you are a director or an executive officer and the income
tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you
on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable. You
9

will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the selfassessment regime and for reimbursing Walmart or an Affiliate, as applicable, for the value of any national insurance contributions
due on this additional benefit, which Walmart or an Affiliate may recover from you at any time thereafter by the means referred to in
Paragraph 10 of the T&C’s.
UNITED STATES
Military Leave . If you were on military leave on the Grant Date, and you are on the same military leave on a Vesting Date, your
Continuous Status must be maintained for not less than six months after your return from the military leave before your Plan Award
shall vest. In such circumstances, for purposes of Paragraph 5, your “Vesting Date” shall be deemed to be the date that is six months
after your return from military leave, and the number of Shares corresponding to any vested RSUs will be delivered to you as soon as
administratively feasible but in any event within 74 days of vesting.

WAL-MART STORES, INC.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
GLOBAL SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT NOTIFICATION AND TERMS
AND CONDITIONS
These Global Share-Settled Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any
applicable special terms and conditions for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the “Agreement”),
contain the terms and conditions of the performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(“Walmart”), a Delaware corporation, under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015, as may be amended from time
to time (the “Plan”).
All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.
BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING:
1.
Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the PRSUs,
which consist of the right to receive a number of Shares underlying the PRSUs set forth above (as further determined in Paragraph 5
below), subject to certain vesting conditions.
2.
Plan Governs . The PRSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are accepting the
PRSUs, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the PRSUs and
your participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and of this Agreement. You further agree to
accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising
under the Plan, including whether, and the extent to which, the Performance Measures, Performance Goals, and time-based vesting
restrictions referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied.

3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the PRSUs or the Shares underlying the PRSUs granted to you pursuant to this
Agreement.
4.

Stockholder Rights . Unless and until your PRSUs vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you:
A.

You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your PRSUs;

B.
You will not receive, nor be entitled to receive, cash or any non-cash dividends on the PRSUs or the Shares
underlying the PRSUs; and
C.
You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the PRSUs. Upon receipt of the
Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and will be
provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart.
5.

Adjustment and Vesting of the PRSUs and Delivery of Shares .
A.
Performance Period and Achievement Rates . The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and Performance
Measures applicable to your PRSUs. You will receive by separate writing a notification of the performance criteria applicable
to your PRSUs in respect of the Performance Period which equals the fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that
employs you (the “Employer”) during which the PRSUs have been granted. The Performance Measures (including any
applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as set forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by
reference into this Agreement.
The number of PRSUs that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that ultimately may be delivered to you shall
depend upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordance
with the Plan, for each Performance Measure during the Performance Period. With respect to each applicable Performance
Measure during the Performance Period:
1.
“Threshold” performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established by
the Committee;
2.

“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and

3.
“Maximum” performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established by
the Committee.
An achievement rate is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of the
Performance Period. The achievement rate value applied to each weighted Performance Measure during the Performance
Period is expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for
achieving at least, but no less than, Threshold performance), 100% (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (for
achieving Maximum performance). A percentage of 0% shall be applied to a Performance Measure during the Performance
Period if Threshold performance is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable
2

achievement rates during the Performance Period is referred to herein as the “Performance Achievement Rate.”
At the end of the Performance Period, the number of PRSUs that were granted to you shall be adjusted to reflect the degree to
which applicable Performance Goals have been attained by multiplying : (x) the Performance Achievement Rate and (y) the
number of PRSUs granted by this Agreement. Subject to Paragraph 10 below, and provided you have not incurred a
Forfeiture Condition before the Vesting Date, the adjusted number of PRSUs (the “Adjusted PRSUs”) represent the number
of Shares you shall receive, as described in Paragraph 5.C below.
B.
Vesting of the Adjusted PRSUs . Subject to Paragraph 7 and provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture
Condition, your Adjusted PRSUs will vest on the Vesting Date set forth above.
C.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares
equal to the number of Adjusted PRSUs as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax
withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively
feasible following the later of: (x) the Vesting Date set forth above; and (y) the date the Committee has determined the degree
of attainment of the Performance Goals applicable to your Plan Award, but in any event:
1. within 150 days of the Vesting Date; or
2. within 74 days of an Accelerated Vesting pursuant to Paragraph 8 below.
Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
D.

Deferral of Shares .
1.
Elective Deferral. If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares upon vesting of Adjusted PRSUs to a
future date in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised
as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
2.
Mandatory Deferral . If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of
Adjusted PRSUs in any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability to
deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the
Code, then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably
anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the “First Non-162(m)
Year”) in accordance with the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m)
Year (and to the extent Walmart has permitted such an election), then Walmart shall not deliver such
3

Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable
election and the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
To the extent you are a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, your Plan Award and
this Agreement are subject to, and conditioned upon, shareholder approval of the material terms of the Performance
Goals referred to in Paragraph 5.A above.
6.
Forfeiture Condition . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, any PRSUs that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on the
Vesting Date, if any, will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.
your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
B.
you have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of
this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that vesting of this Plan Award is
further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete,
in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and
Covenant Not to Compete prior to the Vesting Date shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such PRSUs or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your PRSUs may be suspended
as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the
administrative suspension period, your PRSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to
such PRSUs or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative
suspension period, then the vesting of your PRSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any PRSUs that would have vested
while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the corresponding number of Shares will be delivered to you as soon as
administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be
considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8.
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your PRSUs
will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.B. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, if your
Continuous Status is terminated by your death or Disability prior to the Vesting Date and you have not incurred a Forfeiture
Condition. The number of Shares you will become vested in under this Paragraph 8 shall be determined as follows:
A.
Any PRSUs that are scheduled to vest within 90 days of the date that your Continuous Status is terminated by
reason of your death or Disability will become
4

immediately vested; provided, however , that if the determination of attainment of Performance Goals has not yet been
determined for your Plan Award, then achievement of Target performance for all applicable Performance Goals shall be
assumed for purposes of this Paragraph 8.A; and
B.
Any PRSUs that are scheduled to vest more than 90 days but within the same fiscal year as the date on which your
Continuous Status was terminated by reason of your death or Disability shall vest and the number of Shares you shall receive
will be prorated by dividing: (x) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date to the date your Continuous Status was
terminated by (y) the number of calendar days from the Grant Date through the Vesting Date set forth above; provided,
however , that if the determination of attainment of Performance Goals has not yet occurred for your Plan Award, then
achievement of Target performance for all applicable Performance Goals shall be assumed for purposes of this Paragraph
8.B.
For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date on
which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of Disability. For purposes of this
Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that you would qualify to receive benefit payments under the long-term disability plan or policy,
as it may be amended from time to time, of Walmart or, if different, the Employer, regardless of whether you are covered by such
policy. If Walmart or, if different, the Employer does not have a long-term disability policy, for purposes of this Agreement,
“Disability” means that you are unable to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the position held by you by reason of any
medically determined physical or mental impairment for a period of not less than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days.
You shall not be considered to have incurred a Disability unless you furnish proof of such impairment sufficient to satisfy Walmart
in its discretion. If your Continuous Status is terminated due to a Disability, you agree to promptly notify the Walmart Global Equity
team. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Walmart will not accelerate your Plan Award if Walmart has not received
notification of your termination within such period of time that it determines, in its sole discretion, to be necessary to process the
settlement of your Plan Award to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
9.

Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates .
A.
Permanent Transfers and Continuous Status . For the avoidance of doubt, a permanent transfer of Continuous
Status from Walmart, or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute a
termination of your Continuous Status.
B.
Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer . If you permanently transfer your
Continuous Status during the Performance Period, then the performance criteria and the resulting adjustment will be prorated
and/or adjusted to reflect the proportion of the Performance Period during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if
different, the Affiliate that initially employed you (the “Initial Employer”) and the proportion of the Performance Period
during which you provided service to Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the
“Subsequent Employer”).
5

C.
Permanent Transfers to Affiliate or Position where Performance-Based Awards are Not Granted . If you
permanently transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are not
granted, the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance Period shall be communicated to
you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in Paragraph 9.B above.
D.
Transfers to New Position with Same Employer . If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as defined
herein) but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings
thereof) and Performance Goals, then the performance criteria applicable for the remaining portion of your Performance
Period shall be communicated to you, and your PRSUs will be prorated and adjusted using the methodology described in
Paragraph 9.B above.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .
A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your PRSUs and acknowledge
that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart (or if different, the Employer), the ultimate
liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related
items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains your
responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that
Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items
in connection with any aspect of the PRSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the PRSUs, the
subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and
are under no obligation to structure the terms of the PRSUs or any aspect of the PRSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability
for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart, to satisfy
any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon
settlement of the Adjusted PRSUs. In the event that such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or
securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance of the PRSUs and this Agreement, you
authorize and direct (a) Walmart and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole
number of Shares corresponding to the Adjusted PRSUs that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to
generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items and (b) Walmart and/or the Employer, or
their respective agents, at their sole discretion to satisfy the Tax-Related
6

Items by any other method of withholding, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid
to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for the Tax-Related
Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including
maximum applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax
purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Adjusted PRSUs, notwithstanding that
a number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. In the event that any excess
amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any
overwithheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by
the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if
you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11.
PRSUs Not Transferable . The PRSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of
or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Adjusted PRSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action
in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled Performance-Based Restricted
Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of PRSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules and regulations specific to
your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such
country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Global Share-Settled
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions and, together, these documents constitute this
Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of PRSUs is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future grants of PRSUs or other awards, or benefits in lieu of PRSUs, even if PRSUs have been granted in the past;
C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of PRSUs or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and
7

nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of Walmart or, if different, the
Employer to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of
Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your
Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your PRSUs;
F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace
any pension rights or compensation;
I.
the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or
expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare
benefits or similar payments;
J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and the
value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director
of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the PRSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with
certainty;
L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the PRSUs resulting from the
termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in
consideration of the grant of the PRSUs, you agree not to institute any claim against Walmart, the Employer or any Affiliate;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right
to receive and vest in the PRSUs under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively
providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the
exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including
whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
8

N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the PRSUs and the benefits evidenced by this
Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the PRSUs or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another
company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares
underlying the PRSUs; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
PRSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the PRSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired
upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the PRSUs
acquired upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to
participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart and
any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You understand
that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home
address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social insurance identification number, passport number or other
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all PRSUs
or any other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose
of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is
assisting Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data
may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data
privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any
potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing,
administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole
purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as
may be required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is
necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United
States, you may, at any time, view Data, request information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary
amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human
resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the
only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that
9

Walmart would not be able to grant PRSUs or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore,
you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information
on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human
resources representative.
16.

Other Provisions .
A.
Determinations regarding this Agreement (including, but not limited to, whether, and the extent to which, the
Performance Measures and Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied, and whether an event has
occurred resulting in the forfeiture of or accelerated vesting of an Adjusted PRSU) shall be made by the Committee in its sole
and exclusive discretion and in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan, and all determinations of the Committee shall
be final and conclusive and binding on you and your successors and heirs.
B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force
and effect for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are
similarly situated.
D.
Walmart reserves the right to amend any applicable Performance Measures (including any weightings thereof)
and/or Performance Goals for any Plan Award under this Agreement. In such a case, any amendments will be communicated
to you in writing (which may include a communication transmitted by electronic means, such as an e-mail communication or
a communication posted online for your review).
E.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.

F.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law
provisions.
G.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
H.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English
language version of such document will control.
I.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation
in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to
participate in the Plan
10

through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party designated by Walmart.
J.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award and
the Shares underlying the PRSUs awarded pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may
be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
K.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by
you or any other Associate.
L.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability
to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the
laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider
trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations and any
applicable Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds
arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or
legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts,
assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account,
exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
N.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from

If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer

aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in
effect in the respective countries as of January 2016. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Walmart

consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the PRSUs vest or you
receive Shares under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and Walmart is not
in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the
relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.

under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as the earlier of (i) the date on which your Continuous Status is terminated, or (ii) the

their respective advisors. You further authorize Walmart or an Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in
your employee file.
Notifications
Securities Law Information . You are permitted to sell the Shares acquired through the Plan through the designated broker, if any,
provided the resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on
which the Shares are listed ( i.e. , the NYSE).
3

Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information . Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive
Shares ( e.g. , PRSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a
Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any
time during the year. Thus, PRSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded
because of other specified foreign property that you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base
(“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own
other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.
CHILE
Terms and Conditions
Labor Law Acknowledgement . The PRSUs and the Shares underlying the PRSUs, and the income and value of same, shall not be

Securities Law Information . This grant of PRSUs constitutes a private offering of securities in Chile effective as of the Grant Date.
This offer of PRSUs is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (“SVS”).
The offer refers to securities not registered at the securities registry or at the foreign securities registry of the SVS, and, therefore,
such securities are not subject to oversight of the SVS. Given that the RSUs are not registered in Chile, Walmart is not required to
provide public information about the PRSUs or the Shares in Chile. Unless the PRSUs and/or the Shares are registered with the SVS,
a public offering of such securities cannot be made in Chile.
Esta Oferta de PRSUs (“Unidades”) constituye una oferta privada de valores en Chile y se inicia en la Fecha de la Oferta. Esta
oferta de Unidades se acoge a las disposiciones de la Norma de Carácter General Nº 336 (“NCG 336”) de la Superintendencia de
Valores y Seguros de Chile (“SVS”). Esta oferta versa sobre valores no inscritos en el Registro de Valores o en el Registro de
Valores Extranjeros que lleva la SVS, por lo que tales valores no están sujetos a la fiscalización de ésta. Por tratarse de valores no
inscritos en Chile no existe la obligación por parte de Walmart de entregar en Chile información pública respecto de los mismos.
Estos valores no podrán ser objeto de oferta pública en Chile mientras no sean inscritos en el Registro de Valores correspondiente.
Exchange Control Information . You are not required to repatriate any funds you receive with respect to the PRSUs ( e.g. , any
proceeds from the sale of any Shares issued upon vesting of the PRSUs) to Chile. However, if you decide to repatriate such funds,
you acknowledge that you will be required to effect such repatriation through the Formal Exchange Market ( i.e. , a commercial bank
or registered foreign exchange office) if the amount of the funds repatriated exceeds US$10,000. Further, if the value of your
aggregate investments held outside of Chile exceeds US$5,000,000 at any time in a calendar year, you must report the status of such
4

investments to the Central Bank of Chile.
You will also be required to provide certain information to the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (“CIRS”) regarding the results of
investments held abroad and the taxes you have paid abroad (if you will be seeking a credit against Chilean income tax owed). This
information must be submitted on an electronic sworn statement, Formulario 1851 (for investments held abroad) and Formulario
1853 (for taxes paid abroad) before March 15 of each year. The formularios may be found at the CIRS website at www.sii.cl .

liability arises or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax Act (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the

Exhibit 10(v)
DEFERRED CONTINGENT MERGER CONSIDERATION AGREEMENT
Dated as of August 7, 2016
Marc Lore
c/o Jet.com, Inc.
221 River Street
Hoboken, NJ 07030
Dear Marc Lore:
As you know, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “ Acquiror ”), has agreed to acquire by merger (the “
Merger ”) Jet.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “ Company ”), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated of
even date herewith (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, the “ Merger Agreement ”), by and among
the Acquiror, the Company and certain other parties thereto. Capitalized terms used in this agreement (this “ Agreement ”) and not
otherwise defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. Any reference to the “ Acquiror ”
will be understood to include any successor to the Acquiror.
Upon the Closing, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will be entitled to receive, for
each share of Common Stock held by you immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the terms of the Merger Agreement, you agree that the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to you pursuant to
the Merger Agreement shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.
1. Merger Consideration Election
The parties hereby agree that 25% of the Merger Consideration payable to you at the Closing shall be paid to you in cash in
accordance with the provisions of Article II of the Merger Agreement, and that 75% of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
to you at the Closing (such Merger Consideration, the “ Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration ”) shall be payable to you on
the applicable annual or monthly anniversary of the Closing Date set forth in the Consideration Schedule (as defined below),
contingent upon and subject to the following provisions.
2. Deferral of Merger Consideration
All of your Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration will be deferred at the Closing and will be held back by the Acquiror

will permanently retain, any portion of the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration that has not become payable to you pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement as of the date of termination of your Employment (as defined below), whether on a voluntary basis or
for any other reason, except as provided in Section 3 below (this provision, the “ Forfeiture Provision ”). “ Employment ” means

writing by the Acquiror.

The Forfeiture Provision will lapse as to each installment of Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration set forth on Annex A
attached hereto (the “ Consideration Schedule ”) on the corresponding date for such installment set forth on the Consideration
Schedule, if your Employment has not been terminated as of such installment date, meaning that such installment of Deferred
Contingent Merger Consideration will become payable to you on such corresponding installment date, without any interest. Deferred
Contingent Merger Consideration that has become payable pursuant to the Consideration Schedule is referred to as “ Due Merger
Consideration ”.
You will receive the payment of your Due Merger Consideration (without interest) on the last day of the calendar month in
which such Due Merger Consideration becomes payable in accordance with the Consideration Schedule, regardless of your
Employment on such date; provided that if the last day of any such calendar month is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day.
3. Special Situations
Subject to any other requirements or limitations in this Agreement, in the event of a termination of your Employment due to
an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) or on account of death or Disability, all of your then-Deferred Contingent Merger
Consideration will be payable in accordance with the Consideration Schedule.
“ Involuntary Termination ” means termination in writing by your Employer of your Employment without Cause (as defined
below) and/or your resignation from your Employer for Good Reason (as defined below).
“ Cause ” means your termination of employment by your Employer due to (a) your intentional or grossly negligent
unauthorized misuse of any trade secrets or proprietary information of your Employer of an Affiliate thereof, (b) your conviction of
or plea of nolo contendere to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, (c) your committing an act of fraud against your
Employer or an Affiliate thereof, (d) your gross negligence or willful misconduct that has had, will have or would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on your Employer’s or any of its Affiliates’ reputation or business, (e) your violation of the
Acquiror’s (i) Global Statement of Ethics or (ii) Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, in each case in this clause
(e) if such violation is not cured (to the extent curable) within 30 days following written notification by the Acquiror of such
violation, (f) your willful and repeated failure or refusal to attempt to perform your duties to your Employer if such failure is not
cured within 30 days following written notification by Employer of such failure, or (g) your material breach of that certain NonCompetition, Non-Solicitation and No Hire Agreement dated August 7, 2016, that certain Nondisclosure and Restricted Use
Agreement dated August 7, 2016 between you and the Acquiror or that certain Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality
Agreement between you and Jet.com, Inc. dated April 16, 2014, if such breach is not cured (to the extent curable) within 30 days
following written notification by Employer of such breach.
“ Disability ” means a “permanent and total disability” as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended; provided that you shall not be considered to have a Disability unless you furnish such proof (including written
certification from a physician) of the existence thereof in such form and manner, and at such times, as the Acquiror may reasonably
require.

“ Good Reason ” means the occurrence of any of the following: (a) a material reduction in your base salary or (b) a required
relocation of your principal place of employment by more than 75 miles; provided , that you shall have grounds for a Good Reason
resignation only if (i) you notify your Employer in writing within 60 days of the occurrence of the circumstances constituting Good
Reason, (ii) your Employer does not reasonably cure such circumstances within 15 days following its receipt of such notice, and (iii)
you actually resign within 30 days following the end of such cure period.
4. Tax Matters
The parties hereto agree that it is their intention that the Deferred Contingent Merger Consideration attributable to Common
Stock either (x) that is vested as of the Closing or (y) for which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code was properly and
timely made except as required by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (i) will be treated as deferred contingent purchase
price for which capital gains treatment is available with respect to your Common Stock and (ii) will be reported for federal income
tax purposes, as deferred contingent purchase price for such Common Stock. The parties shall take all tax reporting positions
consistent with this paragraph, except if challenged in writing by a Governmental Authority, in which case the challenged party shall
give notice of same to the other party and each party shall use best efforts to cooperate jointly to defend the positions taken in this
paragraph until such time as a non-appealable order has concluded that a different tax consequence applies to the Deferred
Contingent Merger Consideration.
You agree to submit a completed and executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 to the Acquiror at the Closing.
5. Miscellaneous

This NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NO-HIRE AGREEMENT (this “ Agreement ”), dated August 7,

E. As an essential inducement for Acquiror to enter into the Merger Agreement, in order to protect the goodwill of the

this Agreement.
AGREEMENT
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Holder hereby
covenants and agrees as follows:
1.

Non-competition .

(a) For a period of five years from the Closing Date (the “ Term ”), Holder shall not directly or indirectly own any interest
in, manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for, be employed in an executive, managerial, administrative or other
capacity by, or in

any manner engage in, any business or entity which is a Competing Business, nor shall Holder directly or indirectly own any interest
in, manage, control, participate in, consult with, render services for, be employed in an executive, managerial, administrative or other
capacity by, or in any manner engage in a Competing Business in an individual capacity. For purposes of this Agreement,
“Competing Business” shall mean a business or entity engaged in the business of e-commerce, selling goods, groceries, merchandise
or services directly online and/or via an online marketplace and/or certain other related businesses conducted by the Company,
within the Business Area, regardless of whether such business or entity principally conducts its business through brick and mortar
operations. For purposes of this Agreement, “Business Area” shall mean the United States or any other geographical areas outside
the United States in which the Company and its Subsidiaries engage or plan to engage in such businesses.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1(a) , Holder may be a passive owner of not more than 2% of any
class of stock of a corporation, which class of stock is publicly traded, so long as Holder has no active participation in the business of
such corporation.
(c) As used herein, the term “ Person ” means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, limited
liability partnership, syndicate, person, trust, association, organization or other entity, including any governmental authority, and
including any successor, by merger or otherwise, of any of the foregoing.
2. Non-solicitation/Non-Hire of Employees . During the Term, Holder shall not, either on Holder’s own account or for any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other Person (including, without limitation, through any existing or future
Affiliate or any other Person with whom Holder is associated in any of the capacities described in Section 1(a) above), solicit, recruit
or hire, or aid in any of the foregoing, any person who is or was within the 12 months preceding the date of such solicitation,
recruitment or hiring (as applicable) any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Affiliates (the “ Company
Employees ”), or knowingly induce or knowingly attempt to induce any such Company Employee to terminate his or her
employment or breach his or her employment agreement, if any; provided , however , that nothing in this Section 2 shall prohibit
such solicitation, recruiting or hiring that results solely from any general solicitation to the public through general advertising or
similar methods of solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at the Company Employees.
3. Non-Disparagement . During the Term and thereafter, Holder shall not disparage Acquiror, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates in any manner that could affect the goodwill, reputation or business relationships of any such Person with the
public generally, or with any of their customers, suppliers, employees or other business partners.
4. Confidentiality . During the Term, except as may be required by applicable law and except for Holder’s attorneys and
accountants, and other representatives who need to know the terms and conditions hereof to provide the services rendered to Holder,
Holder shall not make any disclosure concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Acquiror, the Company,
any of their respective Affiliates or the business, performance, structure or governance of any of the Acquiror, the Company, any of
their respective Affiliates, without prior written approval by the Acquiror, which approval may be given or withheld by the
2

Acquiror in its sole discretion. If any announcement is so required by applicable law with respect to any party hereto, prior to making
such announcement, such party will deliver a draft of such announcement to the Acquiror and shall give the Acquiror reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon.
5. Stay of Time . In the event a court of competent jurisdiction or other entity or person mutually selected by the parties to
resolve any dispute (collectively a “ Court ”) has determined that Holder has violated one or more provisions of this Agreement, the
running of the time period of such provisions so violated shall be automatically suspended as of the date of such violation and shall
be extended for the period of time from the date such violation commenced through the date that the Court determines that such
violation has permanently ceased.
6. Specific Performance . Holder acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Company
and the Acquiror would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is
accordingly agreed that, with respect to any such breach, the parties hereto (a) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action. In the event of litigation arising out of this
Agreement, if a Court issues a final non-appealable judgment, the non-prevailing party in such litigation agrees to reimburse the
prevailing party for its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) in obtaining such judgment.
7. Notices . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given (a) on the
date of delivery if delivered personally, or if by ‑mail, upon written confirmation of receipt by e‑mail or otherwise, (b) on the first
Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered utilizing a next-day service by a recognized next-day courier or (c) on the
earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return

8. Separate Covenants . This Agreement shall be deemed to consist of a series of separate covenants, one for each line of
business included within the Business as it may be conducted by the Company and its successors on or after the date hereof, and
each city, county, state, country or other region included within the Business Area. The parties expressly agree that the character,
duration and geographical scope of this Agreement are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on the date upon which
this Agreement has been executed. However, should a determination nonetheless be made by a Court at a later date that the
character, duration or geographical scope of this Agreement is unreasonable in light of the circumstances as they then exist, then it is
the intention and the agreement of the Company, the Acquiror and Holder that this Agreement shall be construed in such a manner as
to impose only those restrictions on the conduct of Holder that may be enforceable under applicable law, to the fullest extent of such
enforceability to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a
Court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants deemed included herein because, taken together, they are more extensive
than necessary to assure the Company and the Acquiror of the intended benefit of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and
agreed among the parties hereto that those of such covenants that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate covenants to be
enforced in such proceeding shall, for the purpose of such proceeding, be deemed eliminated from the provisions hereof.
9. Severability . If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a Court to be invalid, void,
unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
4

10. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction . This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and this Agreement
and all disputes hereunder shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of law provision
which would require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party or its successors or assigns against any other party shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such legal
action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment,
decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as
provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein
for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (a) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (b) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (c) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.
11.

Amendments and Waivers .

(a) This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of
the parties hereto at any time with respect to any of the terms contained herein.
(b) Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be
waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver,
but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as
a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
12. Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; except for that certain NonDisclosure and Restricted Use Agreement dated as of August 7, 2016, which is in full and force and effect, along with this
Agreement.
5

13. Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate counterparts (including facsimile and
electronic transmission counterparts), each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of which, when
taken as a whole, shall constitute one and the same instrument.
14. Section Headings and References . The headings of each Section, subsection or other subdivision of this Agreement are
for reference only and shall not limit or control the meaning thereof. All references to a Section are references to a Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and include all subparts thereof.
15. Assignment; Successors . Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent of
the Acquiror (in the case of an assignment by Holder) or the Holder (in the case of an assignment by the Acquiror or the Company),
and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; provided , however , that the Acquiror or the
Company may assign this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Acquiror without the prior consent of Holder; provided , further , that no
assignment shall limit the assignor’s obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
16. Further Assurances . From time to time, at the request of any member of the Company and without further
consideration, Holder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action as reasonably requested, to
make effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the terms of this Agreement.
17. Early Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our
operations, we help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile
capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for
our customers. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve over 260 million customers who visit our 11,695 stores under 59 banners in 28
countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a
great experience. By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday
low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change
under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost
savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital and physical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broad
assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.
Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
•

Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has
historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to
the Company's net sales and operating income.

•

Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These businesses consist of
numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement,
specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is
lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through
acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding digital retail.

•

Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a
significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage
of net sales than our other segments.

The following examples illustrate the pursuit of our strategy to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping:
•

In September 2016, we completed the acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"), a U.S. based e-commerce company. The total purchase price for the
acquisition was $2.4 billion, net of cash acquired. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in
intangible assets. As part of the transaction consideration, we will pay additional amounts accounted for as compensation of approximately $0.8
billion over a five year period, including approximately $0.5 billion in cash and approximately $0.3 billion in equity. The impact on fiscal 2017 net sales
and operating income as a result of the acquisition was not significant. The acquisition of jet.com is in line with the Company's strategic framework of
accelerating e-commerce growth.

•

In June 2016, we announced our strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and the sale to JD of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce
operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application in exchange for approximately 5 percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares
on a fully diluted basis. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain in our International segment, which gain is included in
membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9
billion of additional JD shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent,
for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares.

Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the
Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar
year basis. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, our
highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 .

Table of Contents
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "), January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 ") and January 31, 2015
("fiscal 2015 ") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the
reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to
period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's
performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of
how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store
and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain
corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain
corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so,
the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores
and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable store and
club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as ecommerce sales. We measure the e-commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through websites and mobile commerce applications and fulfilled
through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications, but fulfilled through our
stores and clubs. Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by
a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to e-commerce acquisitions
are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the
retail industry. The method of calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club
sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In discussing our operating results, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all
countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currency
exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange
rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of
this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating
income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.
The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar,
variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or
international chains or have a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in
attracting and retaining quality employees (whom we call "associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but
not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit
availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions,
insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating
results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 , and in the discussion under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 .

Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our
business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. For several years, our performance metrics
emphasized three financial priorities: growth, expense leverage and returns. We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the integration
of digital and physical retail. These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported by everyday
low cost. During this time of increased investments, we are focused primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term health of the Company including expense
leverage and returns. Although we will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, our growth going forward will rely more on increasing comparable store
and club sales and accelerating e-commerce sales growth.
Our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing
working capital to deliver strong free cash flow. We plan to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Growth
We measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over-period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales, which include the
impact of e-commerce sales. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments may
not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales in the near term.

Our consolidated net sales increased $2.7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 2017 and decreased $3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal
year. Net sales for fiscal 2017 were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and e-commerce sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in
consolidated retail square feet. The positive effect of such factors was partially offset by a negative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctuations in
currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. Net sales for fiscal 2016 were negatively
impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's
Club segment. The negative effect of such factors was partially offset by 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart
U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company.
Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales
Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores
and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable
store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club
sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our
calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable
store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store and
club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , were as follows:

Comparable store and club sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 1.4% and 0.3% in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal
year. The fiscal 2017 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the
Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales
positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.4% and 0.7% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2017 . The fiscal 2016 total U.S.
comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to a
significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable
sales approximately 0.2% and 0.6% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2016 .
As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.
We estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7% and 0.8% in fiscal 2017
and 2016 , respectively. Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on their
proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened.

Returns
While we are focused primarily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced. We generate returns by
efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital. We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, which
we discuss below. In addition, we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the
Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends
in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the
financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI.
ROA was 7.2% and 7.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ROI was 15.2% and 15.5% for the fiscal years ended January 31,
2017 and 2016 , respectively. The declines in ROA and ROI were primarily due to our decrease in operating income over these periods.
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing
12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets,
plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a
rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact
of the discontinued operations.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are
included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, we exclude the impact
of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of
eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure
computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is
consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and
adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a
factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our
key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.
Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate
our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional
cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be
considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a
measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in
investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash
provided by operating activities of $31.5 billion , $27.4 billion and $28.6 billion for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $20.9
billion , $15.9 billion and $16.4 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in
fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations
related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2016
from fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital
management.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the
measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we
believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by
Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to
be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used
in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $3.7 billion or 0.8% for fiscal 2017 and
decreased $3.5 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 2017 and decreased
$3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable
sales and e-commerce sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales
for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a negative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in
fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. For fiscal 2016 , net sales were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuations
in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors on our
consolidated net sales was partially offset by the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and
higher e-commerce sales across the Company.
Gross profit rate increased 36 and 29 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase
in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower
transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics
programs in the Walmart International segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017 . For fiscal 2016 , the increase in gross profit rate was
primarily due to improved margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables in the Walmart U.S. segment. Changes in the merchandise mix in the Walmart
International segment and a reduction in low margin fuel sales in the Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our fiscal 2016 gross profit rate, while pharmacy
reimbursement pressure at the Walmart U.S. segment negatively impacted our fiscal 2016 gross profit rate.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 88 and 91 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's
Club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure; a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and
severance; and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal
2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 . For fiscal 2016 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of
net sales was due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve the
overall customer experience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the store closures announced in January 2016 and our investments in digital retail and
information technology.
Membership and other income increased $1.0 billion for fiscal 2017 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2016 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in
the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due the recognition of a $535 million gain in the second
quarter of fiscal 2017 from the sale of certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and
application, to JD, and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 , and 32.2% for fiscal 2015 , respectively. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to
period and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws,
outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. The reconciliation from the
U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $14.3 billion , $15.1 billion and $16.8 billion of consolidated income from continuing operations for fiscal
2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively; a decrease of $0.8 billion and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart was $4.38 , $4.57 and $4.99 for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $9.5 billion or 3.2% and $10.3 billion or 3.6% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the
previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 1.6% and 1.0% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively,
driven primarily by positive customer traffic, as well as year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.4% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . Additionally, ecommerce sales contributed 0.4% and 0.2% to comparable store sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
Gross profit rate increased 24 and 12 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase
in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower
transportation expense from lower fuel costs. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandise
and consumables, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 101 and 113 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous
fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the continued investment in the associate wage structure; a
$249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects; and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology. The increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 . For
fiscal 2016 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours.
Enhancements to the customer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increased
maintenance expenses. In addition, the $670 million charge to operating expenses for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in store
associate incentive expense and our investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the fiscal 2016 increase in operating expenses as a
percentage of segment net sales.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was $17.7 billion , $19.1 billion and $21.3 billion during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $7.3 billion or 5.9% and $12.8 billion or 9.4% for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared
to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net sales was due to the $11.0 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Additionally, net sales for fiscal 2017 were impacted by positive comparable store sales in all of our markets, except in the United Kingdom, and year-over-year
growth in retail square feet of 1.2% . For fiscal 2016 , the decrease in net sales was due to the $17.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Additionally, net sales for fiscal 2016 were impacted by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and positive comparable sales in
Mexico and Canada, partially offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. and China.
Gross profit r ate increased 46 and 23 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs. For fiscal 2016 ,
the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to changes in the merchandise mix in certain markets.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 58 and 44 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous
fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to declining sales on relatively flat fixed costs
in the United Kingdom as well as adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment charges in certain markets. The increase in operating expenses as a
percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closure of 115 underperforming
stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets in January 2016, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates in Brazil and investments in
digital retail and information technology.
Membership and other income increased $0.8 billion for fiscal 2017 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2016 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2017 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due the recognition of a $535 million gain in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from the sale of
certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD, and a $194 million gain
from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was $5.8 billion , $5.3 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating income by $642 million , $765 million and $225 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively.

Sam's Club Segment
We believe the information in the following table under the caption "Excluding Fuel" is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of
the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact
the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.5 billion or 0.9% for fiscal 2017 and decreased $1.2 billion or 2.1% for fiscal 2016 when compared to the
previous fiscal year. The fiscal 2017 increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable club sales without fuel driven by higher e-commerce
sales, and a year-over-year increase in retail square feet of 0.9% , partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in fuel sales primarily from lower fuel prices. The
fiscal 2016 decrease in net sales was primarily due to declines in comparable club sales, which were driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resulted
primarily from lower fuel prices. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and higher e-commerce sales
at samsclub.com.
Gross profit rate increased 39 and 30 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2017 , the increase
was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel, health and wellness, and grocery, partially offset by changes in merchandise mix and the
growth of the Cash Rewards program. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was primarily due to the reduction in low margin fuel sales and lower merchandise acquisition
costs, partially offset by the segment's continued investment in the Cash Rewards program.
Membership and other incom e decreased 6.5% for fiscal 2017 and increased 5.3% for fiscal 2016 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For
fiscal 2017 , the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of 2.3% in membership income as a result of increased
Plus Member renewals. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades and Plus Member renewals.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 49 and 67 basis points for fiscal 2017 and 2016 when compared to the previous fiscal year. For
fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses from
the continued investment in the associate wage structure; our continued investments in digital retail and information technology; and an increase in advertising
expense. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales, an increase in wage
expense due to the new associate wage structure, our investments in new clubs, digital retail and information technology, and the approximately $60 million charge
for club closures announced in January 2016.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating inco me was $1.7 billion , $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion f or fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,
supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support
the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and
share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends and
fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $31.5 billion , $27.4 billion and $28.6 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in net cash
provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital management.
Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. The decrease in net
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations,
partially offset by improved working capital management.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $9.2 billion and $4.4
billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit reflects the Company's leverage achieved through savings from
procuring merchandise and improved inventory management. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding
operations, consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost
possible. We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash
flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain
exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations or
through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the
U.S. statutory rate, we realize an effective tax rate benefit. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our
foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less
applicable foreign tax credits. Although there can be no assurance of the impact on the Company of potential federal tax reform in the U.S., we do not expect
current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect
on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local
laws or other restrictions.

Net cash used in investing activities was $14.0 billion , $10.7 billion and $11.1 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and generally consisted of
payments to add stores and clubs, remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our digital retail capabilities and invest in other companies and technologies. For fiscal
2017 , we opened 292 new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year,
primarily due to our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD, partially offset by $0.7 billion in cash received from the sales of shopping malls in Chile. Refer to

We continued to focus on seamlessly integrating the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanding in digital retail in each of our
segments during fiscal 2017 . Our fiscal 2017 accomplishments in this area include continuing to roll out our new web platform in the U.S. and open new ecommerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as well as growing "Online Grocery" to over 600 pickup locations in over 100 U.S. markets.
Growth Activities
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 "), we plan to add between 249 and 279 new stores and clubs, which reflects a slowing of new store
openings in the U.S. compared to recent fiscal years while increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives. We
anticipate financing these growth activities through cash flows provided by operating activities and future debt financings.
The following table provides our projected fiscal 2018 capital expenditures by segment, and includes our anticipated digital retail expenditures. The amounts in the

Net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and
the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used
in financing activities increased $2.8 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.
Short-term Borrowings
Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings decreased $1.7 billion and increased $1.2 billion in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, when compared to the
balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend
payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings
was due to improved cash flows from operations driven by working capital improvements and changes to tax regulations. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in net cash
flows provided by short-term borrowings partially offset a larger $2.0 billion decrease in long-term debt due within one year.

Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. The current
$20.0 billion share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases. At January 31,
2017 , authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired
and returned to an unissued status. The Company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,
current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significant
majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis,
the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

Significant Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests
In fiscal 2016, as described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in
Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete this transaction. Additionally, during fiscal 2015,
we completed the purchase of substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash to
complete this transaction.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows from continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated
operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share
repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at
favorable rates in capital markets. At January 31, 2017 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as
follows:
Rating agency
Standard & Poor's
Moody's Investors Service
Fitch Ratings

Commercial paper

Long-term debt

A-1+
P-1

AA

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.
Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include
changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and
capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or
impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings
could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely
more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or
debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any
other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

"Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classified as fair value hedges.
"Capital lease and financing obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 in the
"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.
Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2017 .

Additionally, the Company has $12.5 billion in undrawn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2017 , and assumes interest rates
remain at current levels for our variable rate debt.
Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital
expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included
in the table above. Purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for
the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on
our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the
obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with
respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts
for some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as
liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for
additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of January 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not
represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,
however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by
managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2017 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased
approximately $177 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents the
principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows
and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to
be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2017 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges.

As of January 31, 2017 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 17% of our total short-term
and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2017 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by
approximately $63 million .

Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2017 ,
movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and
Mexico were the primary cause of the $2.7 billion loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a
portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment
hedges.
We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure
associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position
of $147 million and $290 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017 . A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the currency
exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2017 would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $521 million . A
hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2017 would have resulted in a loss or gain in value
of the swaps of $11 million .
In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our
foreign operations. At January 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had £2.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United
Kingdom. At January 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gain
or loss in the value of the debt of $284 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥10 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , that was designated as
a hedge of our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would
have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of $8 million .
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in
non-functional currencies.
Other Matters
We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2017 , including certain risks arising therefrom, in
Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the caption "Risk Factors" and under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the FCPA investigation in Item

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and
require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our
financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a
summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.
Inventories
We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for
substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method
of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since
permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the LIFO
method.
Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise
grouping's retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO
provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires
management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit
recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has
diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and
anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could
cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.
When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.
Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. At January 31, 2017 and 2016 , our
inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annual
inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results.
Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions
and operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash
flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of
conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These
factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management
determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a
quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is
more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a
quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows,
growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method
such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future
operating results could be materially impacted.

Income Taxes
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the
determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our
effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation
allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international
operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are
recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from
taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We
account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible
and taxable items.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors
are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of
future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by
assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and
available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or
through the Company's e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly
integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for our customers. Each week, the Company serves over 260 million customers who visit its 11,695 stores
under 59 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be
competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "),
January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 ") and January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 "). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. We consolidate variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the
equity method. These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The
Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during
January 2017 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic
benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions
classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and $3.4 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. In addition, cash and cash equivalents
included restricted cash of $265 million and $362 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from
various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements.
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, $5.9 billion and $4.5 billion , respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity
needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum
cost possible. Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidity
needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the
Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.
When the income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local
country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit. If the Company's intentions with respect
to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under
current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Although there can be no assurance of the impact on the
Company of potential federal tax reform in the U.S., the Company does not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated
future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
32

Table of Contents
As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.
due to local laws or other restrictions.
Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:
• insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;
• banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;
• consumer financing programs in certain international operations;
• suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and
• real estate transactions.
The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries. The
receivable balance from consumer credit products was $1.2 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $79 million at January 31, 2017 , compared to a
receivable balance of $1.0 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $ 70 million at January 31, 2016 . These balances are included in receivables, net, in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out
("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the
retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at
the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club
segment is valued using the LIFO method. At January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories
as if they were valued at FIFO.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while
costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and
includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total
depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2017 , 2016
and 2015 was $10.0 billion , $9.4 billion and $9.1 billion , respectively. Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were $36 million , $39 million and $59
million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Leases
The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the
abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected term
is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the
useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are
made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to
the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is
33

Table of Contents
shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining
straight-line rent expense for operating leases.
The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's
construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless
of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing
obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing
obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assets
and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease
term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a noncash gain on sale of the property.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are stated at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level
or, in certain circumstances, a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful
lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured
based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges of
long-lived assets for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were not material.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting
unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended
use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative
assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment
based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting
unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for
goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method
and relative market-based approaches.
The Company's reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the
carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 :

Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2016 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com").

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for

Table of Contents
annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded
for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain
employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance
sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out
expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-party
actuaries to ensure liability estimates are appropriate. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and
retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary
differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.
Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,
expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is
evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating
earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax
income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company
records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in
the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.
Revenue Recognition
Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Digital retail sales include
shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. The
following table summarizes membership fee activity for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee is
included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Shopping Cards
Customer purchases of shopping cards, to be utilized in our stores or on our e-commerce websites, are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the
customer purchases merchandise using the shopping card. Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can
redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely. Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates.
A
35

Table of Contents
certain number of shopping cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards and
recognizes revenue for these amounts when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates.
Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of
net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of
transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import
distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific
programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of
sales and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in certain limited situations when the
payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the
majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'
distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include
all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific,
incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.
Advertising costs were $2.9 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Pre-Opening Costs
The cost of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed as
incurred and included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled
$131 million , $271 million and $317 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance
sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The income statements of all
international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income
statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Management continues to
evaluate the impact this ASU, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. While
management does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flows, the ASU will impact the timing of
recognition of some revenue and may impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts. Management expects the most significant timing change
to result from the revenue associated
36

Table of Contents
with the unredeemed portion of Company issued gift cards, which will be recognized over the expected redemption period of the gift card under the new standard
rather than waiting until the likelihood of redemption becomes remote or waiting for the gift card to expire. Additionally, management continues to assess the
guidance and the related interpretation to determine if that guidance will impact the gross amount of revenue presented for certain contracts. The Company is
planning to adopt this ASU on February 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach, which will result in a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings.
Leases
In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitative
disclosures are required, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The Company is planning to adopt the ASU on February 1,
2019. Management is evaluating this ASU and currently expects it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Management is still
evaluating the effect on consolidated net income, cash flows and disclosures.
Financial Instruments
In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments–Overall ( Topic 825 ). ASU 2016-01 updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently
evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet and disclosures.
In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) . ASU 2016-13 modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of
certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is
currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's consolidated net income, balance sheet, cash flows and disclosures.
Stock Compensation
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . ASU 2016-09 includes new guidance on stock compensation, which
is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance will change several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Management has determined that the
Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of the year ended January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"). Management has evaluated this ASU and determined that,
upon adoption, it will have an immaterial retrospective impact on the classification of cash flows between operating and financing activities.

Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
relevant period. Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding
that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2017 ,
2016 and 2015 .

The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's Stock
Incentive Plan of 2010. The Plan was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation
awards for which 210 million shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
•

Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions
related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0%
to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance
share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is
determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is
recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units
in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was 8.3% , 7.4% and 7.1% , respectively.

•

Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from
the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant
using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The
expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to
determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was 9.0% , 8.7% and 9.5% , respectively.

In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The
stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above.

Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. The current $20.0
billion share repurchase program, as authorized by the Board of Directors on October 13, 2015, has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over
which the Company can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2017 , authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share
repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,
cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of
shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

In June 2016, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial
paper program.

The committed lines of credit mature at various times between May 2017 and June 2021 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis
points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the lines of credit listed in the
table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt.
Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling $3.6 billion and $4.5 billion at January 31, 2017 and 2016 ,
respectively. These letters of credit are utilized in normal business activities.

The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted
by certain derivative financial instruments described in Note 8 .
A portion of other debt at January 31, 2017 and 2016 includes secured debt in the amount of $14 million and $13 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an
aggregate carrying amount of approximately $82 million and $131 million , respectively.

At January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the
amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does
not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par. Accordingly, this issuance has
been classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset
could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the
amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability
with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
•
•
•

Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts the
Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the
income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the notional
amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Additionally, the Company has available-for-sale securities that are measured at fair value on recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Changes in fair value are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, other indefinite-lived
acquired intangible assets, and investments, are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not record any significant impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 or 2016 .
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to
their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate
for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , are as follows:

Note 8. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange
rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company
to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedging
relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.
Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or
contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's
exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing
credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.
The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to
entering into derivative transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements,
including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $242 million and $345 million at January 31, 2017 and January 31,
2016 , respectively. The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part of
the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net
derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31,
2017 , and had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2016 . The Company records cash collateral it posts with
counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the
contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are
effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge
accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the
ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the
Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.
Fair Value Instruments
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional
amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that
receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the
derivative instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fair
values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in
earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from
October 2020 to April 2024 .
Net Investment Instruments
The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixedrate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These
instruments will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 .
The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currencydenominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt
instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that is also
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. At January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , the Company had ¥10.0 billion of outstanding long-term debt
designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 billion at January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 that was
designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to
January 2039 .

Table of Contents
Cash Flow Instruments
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted
payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on
the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects
earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of
effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into
earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the
period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging
from April 2022 to March 2034 .
Financial Statement Presentation
Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on
maturity date, and those hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7
for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments.

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation
The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations,
including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company's
significant accounting policies in Note 1 . The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax
rate. Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are not subject to current U.S. income tax. A reconciliation of the significant
differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:

Unremitted Earnings
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries of approximately $26.6 billion
and $26.1 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S. However, if
any portion were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company provides
deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
At January 31, 2017 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $6.1 billion . Of these carryforwards,
approximately $3.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2037 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2017 , the
Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.9 billion , which will expire in various years through 2027 if not utilized.
The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including
taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the
extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a
valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the
valuation allowance will be released.
48

Table of Contents
The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily
with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Net activity in
the valuation allowance during fiscal 2017 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of
deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2017 , decreases due to operating loss
expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully
realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability
that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.1 billion and $607 million , respectively. The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $703 million and $522 million for January 31, 2017 and 2016 ,
respectively.
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,
respectively. During fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recognized interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $35 million , $5 million and $18
million , respectively. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $72 million and $60 million , respectively, was
recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of January 31, 2017 or
2016 .
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $300 million
, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as
expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve
months. The Company does not expect any change to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2017 . The Company also remains
subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2000 through 2017 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal
years ended 2011 through 2017 .
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in
various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless
otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if
decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In particular, Brazil federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large
number of non-income tax assessments. One of these interpretations common to the retail industry in Brazil relates to whether credits received from suppliers
should be treated as a reduction of cost for purposes of calculating certain indirect taxes. The Company believes credits received from suppliers are reductions in
cost and that it has substantial legal defenses in this matter and intends to defend this matter vigorously. As such, the Company has not accrued for this matter,
although the Company may be required to deposit funds in escrow or secure financial guarantees to continue the judicial process in defending this matter in Brazil.

Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an
accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its
shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 10,000 "equal value" claims that are proceeding before an
Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who
allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of
male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively
justified. Claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higher wage rates on a
prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the future. On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the
Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA's
requests. Following additional proceedings, the Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed to review the "strike out" issue and the Court of Appeals agreed to review the
stay issue. On May 26, 2016, the Court of Appeals denied ASDA's appeal of the stay issue. On October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment
Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.
Claimants will now proceed to the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work
performed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. On November 23, 2016, ASDA filed a request with the Employment Appeal Tribunal to
hear an appeal of the October 14, 2016 ruling, which was granted on January 11, 2017. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may
be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal
defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.
FCPA Investigation and Related Matters
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things,
alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including
Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company.
The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going
investigation of these matters.
The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is
engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company
voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since the
implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made
aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the
Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or
investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not
limited to, Brazil, China and India.
As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been
cooperating with the agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. As these discussions are preliminary, the Company
cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters.
A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican
governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the
50

Table of Contents
matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors,
certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.
The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in
respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments,
settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuits
referenced above may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company
expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could
impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.
In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony
and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations.
These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in
connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:

While the Company believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and
investigations, the Company cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters. Although the Company does
not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can
provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business in the future.
Note 11. Commitments
The Company has long-term leases for stores and equipment. Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and
contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $2.6 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ,

Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The
Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under
these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching
contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.
Participants age 50 or older may defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are

Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items
The Company completed the following transaction that impacts the operations of the Company's Walmart U.S. segment:
Jet.com, Inc.
In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based e-commerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. ecommerce business will build upon the current e-commerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer
base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in
goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part of the transaction, the Company will pay additional compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five
year period.
The Company completed the following transactions that impact the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment:
Suburbia
In August 2016, one of the Company's subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement to sell Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for approximately
$1.0 billion in total consideration, resulting in $634 million in current assets held for sale and $180 million in current liabilities held for sale as of January 31,
2017. The transaction has received regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2018.
Yihaodian and JD.com, Inc. ("JD")
In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application,
to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary shares of JD representing approximately five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The $1.5
billion investment in JD is carried at cost and is included in other assets and deferred charges in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The sale resulted
in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain, which gain is included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an
incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares.
In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian for approximately $760 million , using existing
cash to complete this transaction.
Walmart Chile
In fiscal 2014, the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders exercised put options that required the Company to purchase their shares in Walmart Chile. In
February 2014, the Company completed this transaction for approximately $1.5 billion using existing cash of the Company, increasing its ownership interest in
Walmart Chile to 99.7 percent . In March 2014, the Company completed a tender offer for most of the remaining noncontrolling interest shares at the same value
per share as was paid to the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders. As a result of completing these transactions, the Company owns substantially all of
Walmart Chile.
Vips Restaurant Business in Mexico
In fiscal 2014, Walmex, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement with Alsea S.A.B. de C.V. to sell the Vips restaurant
business ("Vips") in Mexico. The sale of Vips was completed on May 12, 2014. The Company received $671 million of cash and recognized a net gain of $262
million in discontinued operations at the time of the sale.

Note 14. Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,
India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and
Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results its chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze
performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify
revenues for each of these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as retail
websites such as walmart.com and jet.com. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail
websites. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporate
overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate
overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,
as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are
reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income
taxes, is provided in the following table:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 31, 2017 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. at
January 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2017 , in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 31, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , based on the
COSO criteria.
As indicated in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Jet.com, which is included in the fiscal year 2017 consolidated financial statements of WalMart Stores, Inc. and represented 1.3% and 0.1% of the Company's consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales, respectively, as of and for the year ended
January 31, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting of Jet.com.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and
redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2017 and our report dated March 31, 2017 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report to Our Shareholders
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Management of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "company" or "we") is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart's Consolidated
Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report to Shareholders. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to
make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of
our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal
auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with and without management present.
Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial
Statements found in this Annual Report to Shareholders. We have made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection
with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") the required certifications related
to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2017 . These certifications are attached as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended January 31, 2017 . Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief
Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2017 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2017 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 , has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report to Shareholders.
Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting
following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting excluded Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com"), a U.S.-based e-commerce company, which the Company acquired in fiscal 2017. Jet.com represented 1.3% and 0.1%
of the Company's consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales, respectively, as of and for the year ended January 31, 2017. The Company's acquisition of
jet.com is discussed in Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2017.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is
accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. Management has assessed the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of
January 31, 2017 , and determined they were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
