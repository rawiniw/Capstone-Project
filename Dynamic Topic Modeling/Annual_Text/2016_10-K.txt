WAL-MART STORES, INC.
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2016
PART I
ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or
through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and
physical shopping. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce
websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries
and e-commerce websites in 11 countries.
Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust
of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy
under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is
core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital
and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and
physical shopping experience.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States
("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "), January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 ") and January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 "). During fiscal 2016 , we generated
total revenues of $482.1 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $478.6 billion .
We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a
franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in
Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.
In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand
and, as of January 31, 2016 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries.
In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31,
2016 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.

Information About Our Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America,
Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart
International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly
reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to
segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as
well as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 62% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has
historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount
to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail,
wholesale and other. These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs,
cash & carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generated
approximately 26% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its
merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.
Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accounted
for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's
operating income. As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate
overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as
determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are
reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
Walmart U.S. Segment
The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as walmart.com. The
Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $298.4 billion , $288.0 billion and $279.4 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During the most recent
fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales.
Physical. The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states,
Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 31 states and Puerto
Rico. The following table provides square footage details on each of our formats as of January 31, 2016 :

Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous
period's presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Operations. Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters, and an increasing number of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets, are 24 hours each day. A
variety of payment methods are accepted at our stores and through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays,
as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.

Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar,
drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, e-commerce and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for
new or relocated retail units.
Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical
shopping largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our
industry. These programs include the following:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent
promotional activity;
EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers;
Rollbacks: our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;
Savings Catcher, Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price;
Walmart Pickup: customer places order online and picks it up for free from a store. The merchandise is fulfilled through our distribution facilities;
Pickup Today: customer places order online and picks it up at a store within four hours for free. The order is fulfilled through existing store inventory;
Online Grocery: customer places grocery order online and has it delivered to home or picks it up at one of our participating stores or remote locations; and
Money Back Guarantee: our commitment to ensure the quality and freshness of the fruits and vegetables in our stores by offering our customers a 100
percent money-back guarantee if they are not satisfied.

We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products
they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience. In addition, our retail website and mobile commerce applications are important
factors in our competition with other retailers, particularly e-commerce retailers.
Distribution. For fiscal 2016 , approximately 79% of the Walmart U.S. segment's purchases of merchandise were shipped through our 137 distribution facilities,
which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry
grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our
perishable grocery merchandise.
Walmart U.S. ships merchandise purchased by customers on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from
multiple locations including from its dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers.
The following table provides further details of our distribution facilities, including return facilities and 13 e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as of

Digital. The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South
Africa and the United Kingdom). Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a
broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click & Collect" in
the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope
of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed
market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate,"
"George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hometrends," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific
brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," "Extra Special" and "Smart Price." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and
local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries,
depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Each country accepts a variety of payment methods.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume
and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious
holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department,
drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the
markets in which we operate. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop,
open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a
large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model
and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant
impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce
applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases,
both in the digital and the physical retail operations.
11

Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and
the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International
segment. During fiscal 2016 , approximately 77% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the
balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further
details of our international distribution facilities, including 19 e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2015, with the exception of

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as
well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which are Costco Wholesale and BJ's Wholesale Club, as well as
with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's
Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality
merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the membershiponly warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry. Our e-commerce website and mobile commerce application have increasingly become important
factors in our ability to compete with other membership-only warehouse clubs.
Distribution. During fiscal 2016 , approximately 69% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's 24 dedicated
distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club
segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. The table below provides further
details of our dedicated distribution facilities, including one e-commerce dedicated fulfillment center and two dedicated import facilities, as of January 31, 2016 .

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution
process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and
sometimes less than an hour.
Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its ecommerce dedicated fulfillment center and other distribution centers.

Other Segment Information
Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 ("Annual Report
to Shareholders") under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 14 in the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 14 also includes information regarding total
revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as Exhibit 13 to
this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein.
Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United
States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores and clubs. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the
stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a
number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our
suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.
Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required
time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the
attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.
Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2016 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees ("associates") worldwide, with nearly 1.5 million
associates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt
associates and a large number of associates turn over each year. We believe our relationships with our associates are good.
On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time
associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016 and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and
part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases. Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring,
training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure. These changes will give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn
higher pay and advance in their careers.
Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards
or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock
Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S. The Company's medical
plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.
Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory
requirements.

The following chart names the executive officers of the Company, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The business

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could
also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.
Strategic Risks
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.
General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or
higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing
market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer
disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and
other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to
one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, otherwise adversely affect our net sales and result in slower
inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory.
Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending
and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand
for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These
conditions may adversely affect our net sales, gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and
consolidated operating results.
Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other
energy, higher transportation costs, inflation, higher commodity prices, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher
tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with
international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our
cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our
operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods,
a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not
producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or the integration of
physical and digital retail, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market
share.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on how
accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment,
whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. A
critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of
shipping. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media
available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail
offerings. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending
patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail, could negatively affect our
relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.
17

We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through the integration of
both areas), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other
important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and
international internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar,
variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment
competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors,
gasoline stations, as well as e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses.
Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores,
hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash & carry operations, convenience stores
and e-commerce and catalog businesses. We compete with such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers in a variety of ways, including the
prices at which we sell our merchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the
shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications,
cost and speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online, through mobile commerce applications and the
integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations.
Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower
our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our
financial performance. See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments.
Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could
result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved
financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive
positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated
companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditures
with all retailers and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications. If we fail to maintain or grow our overall market position
through the integration of our physical retail presence and digital retail, our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater
concentration of retail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores and
clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such in-store and in-club traffic creates and could
reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments’ overall operations.
Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as
major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events,
such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial
performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and
distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and
clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability
of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income,
the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the
disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of
products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their
impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in
2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance.
18

In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical
storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be
primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts
to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the
destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic
levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important
factor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to
otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and
efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers'
failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their
manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the
suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of
merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the
suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the
importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our
control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered
by our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our financial performance.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or
that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and
non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to
reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial
performance.
We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and
secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we
have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up
systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer
programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as
fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or
cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the
interim. Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our
information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are
undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may
fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.
19

If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our
ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com in the U.S. and
our retail websites in 10 other countries, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart
phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using
social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer "Walmart
Pickup" and "Club Pickup" and in a growing number of locations, "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be
shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.
Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart
International segment operates.
We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors through
focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide
attractive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and
that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related
technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material
adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a
result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, members, associates, vendors and
others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results.
As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and
store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without
limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations at
www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over
public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our
information systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes,
protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their
engagements with us.
However, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which
cyber-attackers may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers'
information systems. During fiscal 2016, we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for Walmart Canada suffered a
security breach that compromised information of users of that company's site, including some Walmart Canada customers, which we believe has not had a material
impact on Walmart Canada or the Company. Walmart Canada discontinued use of this third party service provider. Sam's Club in the United States also used the
same third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by Walmart Canada. After the breach in Canada,
Sam's Club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider. Once the security
review was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider, along with a determination that
the information of Sam's Club members was not compromised by the security breach, Sam's Club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the
same third party service provider.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully
defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future like the incident referenced
above and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access,
and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach
occurs. Moreover, associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service
providers' security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems (whether digital or otherwise).
20

Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period
of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any
customers and members whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our information
systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
In addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our
operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and
financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by
our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security
breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against
cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label cards and gift cards, and we may offer new
payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. By accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment, we are subject to
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains compliance
guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. The
payment card industry set October 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay,
MasterCard, Visa (EMV) chip card credit and debit transactions. While we already accept many EMV cards, if we are unable to fully implement EMV as planned,
we may incur increased costs associated with the liability shift. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the American
National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. Even though we comply with these guidelines and standards
and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able
to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the
extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers,
financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security
laws and standards could be significant to us.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially
adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates
globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and
distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a
sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates,
changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to
attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in
February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates aggregating $1.5 billion in the year ending January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") will increase our
wage and other labor expenses significantly. If we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross
profit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending January 31, 2018 and
thereafter, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating
income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even
more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our
labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
21

We may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the U.S., which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to
increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood
Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites
on acceptable terms. Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various
formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our
operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities
and states, including in market areas in which we have no existing operations.
Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters.
Moreover, our expansion in our existing local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level of
cannibalization of the sales of existing stores or clubs. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or
Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retail
concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to
our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have
existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as
supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a
market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to
acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to
build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand
product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods.
Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets
not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve.
Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets
as we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets, which closures impede the growth of our international operations.
Finally, some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries, making
our entry into those markets, which may present attractive growth opportunities, more difficult, if not impossible. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our
Walmart International segment, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected.
We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such
candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no
certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our
failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could
adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance.
Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are
denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses
of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of
22

operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our
consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period
improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency
exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect
on our reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the
goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable
to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with
a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these
expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, earnings and earnings per share or new store and
club openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies.
Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to
the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and
the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in
China in addition to our U.S. operations. During fiscal 2016 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net sales. Our
divisions also source goods and services from other countries. The future expansion of our operations in countries outside the U.S. could result in our international
operations accounting for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout
the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political
instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws,
anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or
in the future.
In particular, Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws,
the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of
business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial
performance.
Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations,
which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade,
monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar
organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks
inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences
and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also
exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in
culture, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business
practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as
the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to
ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including
those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will
engage in business practices that are prohibited by our
23

policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies,
could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
We are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The
determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes
could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or
accounting principles.
We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing
tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts
recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which
such determination and settlement is made.
We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a
number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of
cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.
In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 7,000 "equal value" claims that are
pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store
employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their
jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not
objectively justified. The claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the
warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in the
store rate prospectively, to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a case
management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation. At this time,
it is undetermined: (i) how many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to
consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of "test cases." Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted as
binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues. Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rate
of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, or
who have performed, like work in that position.
On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court
in the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March
23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules.
Following argument and appellate proceedings, the claims have remained in the Employment Tribunal. The issue of stay, strike out, and the scope of Employment
Tribunal rules are the subject of further appellate proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3.
Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 in the "Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other
things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign
subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or
misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global
anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and
we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of
potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In
November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the
DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government
agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several
of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.
We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the
matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines,
penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits
may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or
impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs
(incremental to the $126 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2016 and the costs incurred in prior years) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in
responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in
defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former
officers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to
other matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media
publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding
to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given
the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these
matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such
situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for
operations and field and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors
to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales
volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents.
For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under "Item 1. Business."

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies,"
which is one of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference in this item. We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal
proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal
proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Wage-and-Hour Class Action: Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart , Ct. of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, PA, 3/20/02 and 8/30/04; Superior Ct. of PA, Eastern
Dist., Philadelphia, PA, 12/7/07; Supreme Ct. of PA, Harrisburg, PA, 10/9/11; US Supreme Court, Washington, D.C., 3/13/15.
ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others-Manchester Employment Tribunal).
II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a
news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the " Times " ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges
various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or
acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants'
conduct affected the value of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of
the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company
is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western District
of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of
appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be
incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Securities Class Action: City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR, 5/7/12.
Derivative Lawsuits: In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, 5/31/12; 8th Circuit Ct. of Appeals, St. Louis,
MO; 4/15/15; In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Ct. of Chancery, 4/25/12.

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are
disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that
may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
During fiscal year 2015, a California Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company (including one of its subsidiaries) that it was investigating whether the
Company and its subsidiary had violated a California statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's and its subsidiary's suppliers as
"biodegradable" or "compostable." On January 13, 2016, the Task Force sent the Company and its subsidiary a settlement demand with the following terms: a $1.5
million civil penalty; a restitution program; a compliance program; and investigative costs. On March 7, 2016, the Company and its subsidiary responded to the
offer and are continuing to work with the Task Force towards a resolution.
On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transportation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection
Agency alleging that Walmart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filters
on some diesel fuelled vehicles. The Company is responding to the allegations and is cooperating with the agency.
On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda ("Walmart Brazil") had failed to
file required reports documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000 and prohibited
Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the imposition
of this penalty.
In September 2014, a spill of approximately 50 liters of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico. A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.
de R.L. de C.V., took steps to address the spill and engaged an expert to oversee the final cleanup. The Municipality of Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately
$128,000 along with the implementation of a monitoring program around the spill area to address the situation. The Company implemented a monitoring program
which concluded that there was no contamination in the spill area and is challenging the penalty in an administrative court.
In February 2014, a division of the Health Department of the City of Vitória notified Walmart Brazil, a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak had been
observed in the parking lot of a store. Walmart Brazil has been cooperating with the agency and believes that it has addressed the situation.
In January 2014, a division of the State Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the proper
license for a wastewater treatment system. Walmart Brazil resolved the matter by paying a penalty of approximately $50,000 and is awaiting the issuance of the
license.
In August 2013, the Company received a notice from the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") alleging that two products sold by the Company have
exceeded volatile organic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations. The Company is responding to the allegations and
cooperating with CARB's investigation.
In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of
Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution
center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the
time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.
In April and May 2011, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico ("Ministry") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de
Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. ("Arrendadora"), that five stores may have been constructed without first obtaining an environmental impact license as
required, and for failing to comply with conditions required by those licenses. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $178,000 related to such stores
and Arrendadora is currently in discussions with the Ministry regarding payment of such amount. In 2014, the Ministry informed Arrendadora it believed that four
additional stores may have been constructed with the same deficiencies. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $640,000 in respect to such additional
stores and also required Arrendadora to obtain the licenses and comply with the required conditions. Arrendadora was subsequently released by an administrative
court from the payment of such penalty. Arrendadora is in compliance with the conditions required for the licenses of all the foregoing stores.
In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil
contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the
District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES

Certain information required to be provided in this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information included under the captions "Market price of
common stock," "Listing" and "Dividends paid per share" in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to
Shareholders that is in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Our common stock is primarily traded in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange. At March 28, 2016 , the latest practicable date, there were 243,327 common
stock shareholders of record.
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On October 13,
2015, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had approximately $8.6 billion of remaining
authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program,
the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. At
January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are
constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for each of the three months in the quarter ended January 31, 2016, was as

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is
accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is
necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or
manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls
and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new,
more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing
monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains
effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions
"Management's Report to Our Shareholders" and "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,"
respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over accounting for leases. The material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting resulted from a lack of controls which allowed for the misinterpretation and historical misapplication of Accounting
Standards Codification 840, Leases ("ASC 840") regarding sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.
Specifically, we did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the sale-leaseback accounting guidance,
primarily leases in which we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets, which should have resulted
in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. To remediate the material weakness described above, we designed and
implemented controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly apply sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee
involvement in the construction of leased assets, under ASC 840.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.
Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

3.6. Award Contributions . Award Contributions shall be made, in the Committee’s sole discretion, by either (1) the Company or
the Participating Employer, as applicable, remitting to the Account Administrator on behalf of the Participant funds sufficient to
purchase any shares or fractional shares of Stock that have been granted to such Participant under the Award Program or (2) the
Participant receiving the Award Contribution directly as a certificate for a share or shares (as applicable) of Stock.
3.7. Voluntary Contributions . Participants may make Voluntary Contributions to the Plan subject to the terms and limitations
described herein or that may be prescribed by the Committee from time to time.
3.8.

Remittance of Contributions .

The Company or a Participating Employer, as applicable, will forward the total of all Payroll Deductions
for the applicable payroll period along with the corresponding Matching Contributions, a list of Participants for whom the

practicable.
4

(b)
Voluntary Contributions, whether made in cash or shares of Stock, shall be remitted to the Account
Administrator directly by the Participant.
(c)
As soon as practicable following a grant of an Award Contribution (for purposes of the “Great Job”
component of the Award Program, a “grant” shall refer to the date on which the Associate tenders his or her four Great Job buttons
to the Company in exchange for a share of Stock), an Award Contribution shall be made in the Committee’s sole discretion as
described in Section 3.6 of the Plan.
(d)
Prior to the time a Participant’s Payroll Deduction and corresponding Matching Contribution is distributed
to the Account Administrator, such amounts are considered general assets of the Company or Participating Employer (as applicable)
and, as such, are subject to the claims of the Company’s or Participating Employer’s (as applicable) creditors in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, no interest shall be paid on such amounts and all Participants assume the risk of fluctuations
in the value or market price of Stock.
IV. ACCOUNT PURCHASES, MAINTENANCE & SALES
4.1. Account Establishment . The Account Administrator shall establish an Account in accordance with the Plan for any Associate
who becomes a Participant. Upon the Committee’s (or its delegate’s) request, the Account Administrator shall establish an Account
for an Associate who is to be awarded shares under an Award Program and who is not then a Participant.
4.2. Share Purchases . No later than five business days after the Account Administrator receives the remittance of funds for
Contributions (including Voluntary Contributions made in cash) made to the Plan, the Account Administrator shall purchase shares
of Stock from the Company, a national stock exchange or in a combination of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Committee may from time to time provide instructions to the Account Administrator with respect to the purchase of such shares of
Stock but, absent such instructions, the Account Administrator shall determine the source of such Stock purchases in its discretion.
(a)
In the case of purchases from the Company of authorized but unissued or treasury shares of Stock, the
price of such shares is equal to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on the relevant date of purchase; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its discretion, designate
some other methodology for determining the fair market value of such shares of Stock purchased from the Company.
(b)
The Account Administrator’s purchase of shares of Stock from a national stock exchange and the price per
share shall be in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee from time to time.
(c)
As determined in the discretion of the Account Administrator (in accordance with any applicable rules and
procedures of the Committee), funds received as Voluntary Contributions may be bundled into a group for the purpose of purchasing
shares of Stock and such shares may be purchased over a time period that is greater than one day. If such shares of Stock are
purchased as part of a bundled group, a Participant’s purchase price for each
5

share of Stock shall be the average price of all shares of Stock purchased within that group as determined by the Account
Administrator.
(d)
No provision of this Plan shall limit the ability of the Committee to implement a real-time trading (or
other) mechanism for the purchase or sale of shares of Stock under the Plan and, to the extent determined by the Committee, shall
replace any other methodology for valuing and allocating shares of Stock purchased or sold under the Plan.
4.3. Share Purchases for Non-U.S. Participants . With respect to non-U.S. Participants, the amounts (1) withheld from such a
Participant’s compensation pursuant to an authorization for Payroll Deduction or (2) contributed as either a Matching Contribution
or an Award Contribution made directly to a Participant’s Account shall be converted from the applicable foreign currency to U.S.
dollars for the purpose of purchasing shares of Stock, and such conversion shall be pursuant to the exchange rate published in The
Wall Street Journal on a date as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of the cash transfer from the Company or the
Participating Employer, as applicable, to the Account Administrator. All such Participants assume the risk of fluctuations in the
value or market price of shares of Stock and applicable currency exchange rates. With respect to non-U.S. Participants making
Voluntary Contributions in cash, such amounts must be tendered to the Account Administrator in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
determined by the Committee.
4.4. Allocation to Accounts . The number of shares (whole and fractional shares) of Stock shall depend upon the purchase price as
described in Section 4.2 at the time such purchases are made. Purchases of Stock will be allocated by the Account Administrator
based upon the applicable purchase price to each applicable Participant’s Account in proportion to the respective amount of
Contributions received for each Participant’s Account. Allocations of Stock will be made in full shares and in fractional interests in
shares to the thousandths of a share.
4.5. Share Ownership . At the time shares of Stock are credited to a Participant’s Account, he or she will acquire full ownership of
all such shares (as well as any fractional interests) of Stock.
(a)
All shares of Stock will be registered in the name of the Account Administrator and will remain so
registered until delivery is requested by the Participant. The Participant may request from the Account Administrator that a
certificate for any or all full shares of Stock be delivered to the Participant at no cost to such Participant at any time.
(b)
The Account Administrator shall cause to be delivered at no cost to each Participant as promptly as
practicable, by mail or otherwise, all notices of meetings, proxy statements and other material distributed by the Company to its
stockholders. The full shares of Stock in each Participant’s Account shall be voted in accordance with the Participant’s signed proxy
instructions timely delivered to the Account Administrator. In the event that a Participant does not timely provide the Account
Administrator with proxy voting instructions, the Account Administrator may direct the voting of such shares of Stock held in an
Account to the extent such action or direction would comply with applicable law and any applicable listing standards of a national
stock exchange.
6

(c)
A Participant may not assign or hypothecate any interest in the Plan; provided, however, that upon
purchase of shares under the Plan, such shares may be sold, assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise dealt with as would be the
case with respect to any other shares of Stock the Participant might otherwise own.
(d)
Neither the Company nor any Participating Employer may make any deductions from amounts properly
credited to a Participant’s Account. Neither the Company nor any Participating Employer shall have any security interest on the
shares of Stock held in a Participant’s Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a lender may have a security interest on the shares of
Stock held in a Participant’s Account if the Participant has pledged such Stock as collateral in connection with a line of credit that
may be obtained by certain Participants (other than Section 16 Officers) through the Stock Secured Line of Credit Program.
4.6. Account Statements . Each Participant will be sent at least an annual statement reflecting all Account activity during the
period covered by the statement.
4.7. Risk of Loss . There is no guarantee of the value or market price of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan. In seeking
potential benefits of Stock ownership, each Participant bears the risks associated with Plan participation and ownership of Stock,
including the risk of any decrease in the value of market price of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan.
4.8.

Commission & Maintenance Charges .

(a)
No brokerage commissions are charged to Participants for purchases of Stock under the Plan, however,
brokerage commissions and other applicable fees shall be charged to the Participant for all sales of Stock from his or her Account.
Such commissions and other applicable fees for sales of Stock held in a Participant’s Account shall be at the rates posted by the
Account Administrator, which may be changed from time to time by the Account Administrator with approval of the Committee (or
its delegate).
(b)
The Company or Participating Employer, as applicable, shall pay the applicable annual maintenance fees
(if any) for the Participant’s Account until the earlier of (1) a Participant Account Closure occurs or (2) the Participant incurs a
termination of employment with the Company or Participating Employer, as applicable, subject to Section 5.3. Any services
requested of the Account Administrator by the Participant that are not covered by the Company’s arrangement with the Account
Administrator shall be paid for solely by the Participant.
(c)
At such time as the Company or Participating Employer, as applicable, ceases to pay the applicable
Account maintenance fees as set forth subsection (b) above, the Participant shall become responsible for any applicable Account
maintenance fees. In this case, annual maintenance fees and other applicable charges to the Account shall be paid from time to time
to the Account Administrator automatically from the proceeds of a sale of a sufficient number of shares of Stock held in the
Participant’s Account until the earlier of a Participant Account Closure or an Automatic Account Closure occurring.
4.9. Account Sales . The Participant may instruct the Account Administrator in writing (or any other method acceptable to the
Committee or its delegate) at any time to sell any portion or all of his or her full shares of Stock and the fractional interest in any
shares of Stock allocable
7

to his or her Account, and the timing for such sale of Stock shall be in accordance with rules and procedures established by the
Committee from time to time.
(a)
The sale price for a share of Stock under the Plan shall be the average price of all shares of Stock sold by
the Account Administrator on the date of the Participant’s sale transaction; provided, however, that the Committee reserves the right
to implement a real‑time trading or similar mechanism for Participants’ sales of shares of Stock from their respective Accounts
under the Plan and the valuation of shares of Stock would be in accordance with any such mechanism.
(b)
Upon such sale, the Account Administrator shall mail to the Participant a check (or such method of
payment as approved by the Committee or its delegate) for the proceeds, less the brokerage commission, and other normal charges
such as sales fees, which are payable by the Participant.
(c)
Such instruction to the Account Administrator, or a request for delivery of Stock certificates held in the
Participant’s Account, will not affect the Participant’s status as a Participant under the Plan unless an Account Closure occurs.
(d)
With respect to non-U.S. Participants, shares of Stock are sold or traded in U.S. dollars and such amounts
can be converted for the purpose of remitting the proceeds to the non-U.S. Participant. If the proceeds from the sale of shares of
Stock held in the Participant’s Account are converted, such conversion shall be made pursuant to the exchange rate published in The
Wall Street Journal on the date such transaction is executed. All such Participants assume the risk of fluctuations in the value or
market price of shares of Stock and applicable currency exchange rates.
V.

ACCOUNT CLOSURE & TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

5.1. Account Closure . A Participant who elects to discontinue Payroll Deductions under the Plan shall continue to be a Participant
until the earlier of a Participant Account Closure or an Automatic Account Closure occurring. In connection with a Participant
Account Closure, the Participant must elect to have his or her Account fully distributed in either (1) Stock (except that the value of
any fractional shares of Stock will be distributed in cash less any applicable fees) or (2) cash by directing all full shares (and
fractional interests) of Stock to be sold with the proceeds, less applicable brokerage commissions and other applicable fees, being
distributed.
5.2. By Termination of Employment Other Than Due to Death of Participant . The Account of a Participant who incurs a
termination of employment (other than by reason of death) with the Company or a Participating Employer will continue to be
maintained with the annual fees and any other applicable charges being paid by the Participant in accordance with Section 4.8(c) of
the Plan.
5.3. By Transferring Employment from the Company or a Participating Employer to an Affiliate . A Participant who transfers
employment from the Company or a Participating Employer to an Affiliate who does not sponsor or participate in the Plan may
continue to have his or her Account maintained at the expense of the Company while still employed with an Affiliate until the earlier
of a Participant Account Closure or an Automatic Account Closure occurring (provided that such Automatic Account Closure can
only occur following termination
8

of employment with such Affiliate). In connection with a Participant Account Closure, the Participant must elect to have his or her
Account fully distributed in either (1) Stock (except that the value of any fractional shares of Stock will be distributed in cash less
any applicable fees) or (2) cash by directing all full shares (and fractional interests) of Stock to be sold with the proceeds, less
applicable brokerage commissions and other applicable fees, being distributed. Such Participant shall no longer be eligible to make
or receive Contributions to the Plan (including by Payroll Deduction or Voluntary Contribution).
5.4. Termination Due to Death of Participant . Following a Participant’s death, the Company or Participating Employer, as
applicable, shall cease making Payroll Deductions and Matching Contributions to such Participant’s Account as soon as practicable.
In addition, as soon as practicable following the Participant’s death, the Account Administrator will distribute the proceeds of the
deceased Participant’s Account less any applicable fees in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee
(which may include a designation by a Participant of a beneficiary or a joint tenant with respect to a Participant’s Account) and, in
the absence of applicable rules and procedures (or such designations), to the Participant’s estate.
VI. AWARD PROGRAM
6.1. Scope of the Award Program . The Award Program is designed to provide an incentive to Associates of the Company and
Participating Employers who provide exceptional customer service and job performance. Awards under the Award Program are not

and an “Outstanding Performance” component.
6.2. Great Job Component . Awards under the Great Job component consist of “Great Job” buttons, which can be worn by
Associates while at work.

Great Job buttons are awarded by management of the Company or Participating Employers, as applicable.

Once an Associate earns four “Great Job” buttons, he or she is eligible to receive one (1) share of Stock
and such Participant will be given a new button signifying that he or she is a “Great Job Stockholder” Associate. As described in
Section 3.6 of the Plan, the Committee may, in its discretion, issue the award of Stock under the Award Program to a Participant’s
Account under the Plan instead of issuing the Stock certificate directly.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Great Job component of the Award Program is
discontinued effective March 9, 2007, with respect to associates in the United States and effective May 1, 2007, with respect to
associates in Canada, and no additional Great Job buttons shall be awarded from and after such date; provided, however, that the
Stock Option Committee is authorized to discontinue the issuance of the Great Job buttons to associates in Canada as of any earlier
appropriate date. Associates may voluntarily surrender Great Job buttons at any time during the period March 9, 2007 through
August 31, 2008 and shall receive one (1) share of Stock for each four (4) Great Job buttons surrendered, or a proportionate
fractional share of Stock for surrender of less than four (4) Great Job buttons. Any Great Job buttons not voluntarily surrendered
during this period shall be cancelled on September 1, 2008,
9

and no additional Stock shall be issued under this Section 6.2 of the Award Program on or after such date.
6.3. Outstanding Performance Component . An “Outstanding Performance” award is an award of Stock to an Associate in
recognition of the individual’s consistently outstanding performance in his or her specific job-related roles over a month, a quarter,
or a year.
(a)
Associates who receive “Outstanding Performance” awards may either be issued certificates for shares of
Stock or, at the discretion of the Committee, the Company (or Participating Employer) may have the Account Administrator
purchase shares of Stock to be credited to the Participant’s Account as described in Section 3.6 of the Plan.
(b)
“Outstanding Performance” awards are either approved directly by the Committee or by its delegate in

AMENDMENT & TERMINATION

suspend or discontinue the Plan at any time in its sole discretion without the approval of the Company’s stockholders, except that (a)

suspension or termination of the Plan.
IX. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
9.1. Successors . All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Contributions made hereunder shall be binding on
any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger,
consolidation, or otherwise of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
9.2. Severability . If any part of the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such
unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any other part of the Plan. Any Section or part of a Section so declared to be unlawful
or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the
fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.

securities exchanges as may be required. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, Participants shall not be entitled to receive
benefits under the Plan, and the Company (and any Affiliate) shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Stock or deliver benefits
to a Participant, if such delivery would constitute a violation by the Participant or the Company or any of its Affiliates of any
applicable law or regulation.
9.4.

Securities Law Compliance .

(a)
If the Committee deems it necessary to comply with any applicable securities law, or the requirements of
any stock exchange upon which shares of Stock may be listed, the Committee may impose any restriction on Contributions or shares
of Stock acquired pursuant to Contributions under the Plan as it may deem advisable. All certificates for shares of Stock delivered
under the Plan pursuant to any Contribution shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may
deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange
upon which shares of Stock are then listed, any applicable securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put
on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. If so requested by the Company, the Participant shall
make a written representation to the Company that he or she will not sell or offer to sell any shares of Stock unless a registration
statement shall be in effect with respect to such shares of Stock under the Securities Act of 1993, as amended, and any applicable
state securities law or unless he or she shall have furnished to the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that
such registration is not required.
(b)
If the Committee determines that the nonforfeitability of, or delivery of benefits pursuant to, any
Contribution would violate any applicable provision of securities laws or
12

the listing requirements of any national securities exchange or national market system on which are listed any of the Company’s
equity securities, then the Committee may postpone any such nonforfeitability or delivery, as applicable, but the Company shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause such nonforfeitability or delivery to comply with all such provisions at the earliest practicable date.
9.5. No Rights as a Stockholder . No Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares
of Stock which may be deliverable to the Participant’s Account in connection with a Contribution (other than a Voluntary
Contribution of previously‑owned shares of Stock) under the Plan until such shares of Stock have been credited to his or her
Account or have been delivered to him or her.
9.6. Nature of Payments . Matching Contributions and Award Contributions shall be special incentive payments to the Participant
and shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Participant for purposes of determining
any pension, retirement, death or other benefit under (a) any pension, retirement, profit‑sharing, bonus, insurance or other employee
benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan shall otherwise expressly provide, or (b) any agreement between
(i) the Company or any Affiliate and (ii) the Participant, except as such agreement shall otherwise expressly provide.
9.7. Non-Exclusivity of the Plan . Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board nor its submission to the stockholders of the
Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other compensatory
arrangements for Associates as it may deem desirable.
9.8. Military Service . The Plan shall be administered in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code and the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.
9.9. Construction . The following rules of construction will apply to the Plan: (a) the word “or” is disjunctive but not necessarily
exclusive, and (b) words in the singular include the plural, words in the plural include the singular, and words in the neuter gender
include the masculine and feminine genders and words in the masculine or feminine gender include the other neuter genders.
9.10. Headings . The headings of articles and sections are included solely for convenience of reference, and if there is any conflict
between such headings and the text of this Plan, the text shall control.
9.11. Stockholder Approval . All Contributions made on or after the effective date of the amended and restated Plan and prior to
the date the Company’s stockholders approve the amended and restated Plan are expressly conditioned upon and subject to approval
of the amended and restated Plan by the Company’s stockholders.
9.12. Taxes . All Matching Contributions and Award Contributions are subject to withholding for applicable federal, state and
local income taxes and will be reported as wage income by the Company. When a Participant authorizes a Payroll Deduction of a
specific
13

amount, more than that amount will actually be withheld from his or her compensation to cover the withholding taxes due on the
Matching Contribution. The distribution of shares of Stock to Participants will not be a taxable event.
9.13. Company-Associate Relationships . Nothing contained in this Plan shall in any way affect the rights of the Company in its
relationship with any Associate or affect the Company’s right to discharge any Associate or increase or reduce any Associate’s
compensation.
9.14. Governing Law . This Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas, except to the extent it is governed by the
federal securities laws or the choice of laws provision contained in the Company’s agreement with the Account Administrator.

1.1
Purpose and Effective Date. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”) believes it is important to provide incentives to Walmart’s
Associates, and Non-Management Directors, through participation in the ownership of Walmart and otherwise. The Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 was originally established under the name Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of
1998 (“1998 Plan”). The 1998 Plan was amended, restated and renamed from time to time, and approved and re-approved by
Walmart stockholders, as the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2005 (“2005 Plan”) and the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan of 2010 (“2010 Plan”), as amended and restated in 2013 (“2013 Restatement”), and most recently on June 5, 2015, as
the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (“Plan”). The Plan, as heretofore amended, is hereby further amended and
restated as set forth herein effective February 23, 2016. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentives to certain Associates and
Non-Management Directors to enhance their job performance, to motivate them to remain or become associated with Walmart and
its Affiliates, and to increase the success of Walmart. The Plan is not limited to Associates who are executive officers of Walmart,
but will be available to provide incentives to any Associate or Non-Management Director that the Committee believes has made or
may make a significant contribution to Walmart or an Affiliate of Walmart.
DEFINITIONS

that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 409A, then for purposes of such Plan Award, “Affiliate” means the entity for which
the Recipient performs services and with respect to which the legally binding right to deferred compensation arises, and all persons
that would be considered a single employer with such entity under section 414(b) of the Code (employees of controlled group of
corporations), or section 414(c) of the Code (employees of partnerships, etc. under common control); provided that the applicable
standard of control for purposes of such determination shall be “at least 50 percent”; and provided further that the entity is one with
respect to which Shares will qualify as “service recipient stock” under Code Section 409A.
2.2

“Associate” means any person employed by Walmart or any Affiliate.

2.3

“Board” means the Board of Directors of Walmart.

by Walmart or an Affiliate; provided that leave does not exceed one year, unless re-employment upon the expiration of that leave is
guaranteed by contract or law or unless provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart or an Affiliate. Notwithstanding the preceding
definition, if a Plan Award provides for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and if the applicable
Notice of Plan Award does not define a term that is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then for
purposes of such Plan Award the Recipient’s Continuous Status will terminate if it is reasonably anticipated that no further services
would be performed by the Recipient after a certain date or that the level of bona fide services the Recipient would perform after
such date (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor) would permanently decrease to no more than twenty percent
(20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an Associate or Non-Management Director, or in any other
capacity) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services to the Walmart or an Affiliate if the

excluded items are objectively determinable by reference to Walmart’s financial statements, notes to Walmart’s financial statements,

Stock Right” as used in such Notices of Plan Award shall, without formal amendment, be deemed to refer to Restricted Stock Units
(as defined above) payable in Shares. To the extent that Notices of Plan Award granted prior to the 2013 Restatement use the term

Shares Subject to the Plan. Subject to Section 11.9, the sum of (a) 50,000,000 Shares plus (b) the number of remaining
Shares under the 2005 Plan (not subject to outstanding Plan Awards and not delivered out of Shares reserved thereunder) as of the
date of stockholder approval of the Plan (collectively, the “Subject Shares”) are reserved for delivery under the Plan. The Subject
Shares may be authorized, but unissued Shares, treasury Shares held by Walmart or an Affiliate, or Shares acquired on the open
market, including shares acquired on the open market by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will purchase Shares on
behalf, and in the name of the Recipient. Shares reserved for delivery pursuant to a Plan Award or any rights

thereto that expire, are forfeited or otherwise are no longer exercisable may be the subject of a new Plan Award.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Shares already owned by a Recipient and used to pay all or a portion of the exercise price of
Shares subject to an Option, and (b) any other Shares reacquired by Walmart after such Shares have been issued (or, in the case of
Open Market Shares, have been delivered), other than Restricted Stock that is forfeited or reacquired by Walmart without lapse of
the Restrictions, shall not become Subject Shares to the extent such Shares are withheld, tendered, or reacquired by Walmart, or are
otherwise no longer exercisable. For avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) when Stock Appreciation Rights are
settled in shares, the full number exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, (ii) when Options are “net exercised,” the full number
exercised shall cease to be Subject Shares, and (iii) shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations shall cease to be Subject
Shares.
3.2 Limits on Shares. No Recipient may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a number of Shares in
any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares granted to such
Recipient in the same Fiscal Year would exceed 2,000,000 Shares; provided, however, that if the Performance Period applicable to a
Plan Award exceeds twelve months, the 2,000,000 Share limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. If a
Plan Award denominated in Shares is cancelled, the cancelled Plan Award continues to count against the maximum number of
Shares for which a Plan Award denominated in Shares may be granted to a Recipient in any Fiscal Year. The Share limit shall be
adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect adjustments to Shares required by Section 11.9.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Non-Management Director may be granted a Plan Award denominated in Shares with respect to a
number of Shares in any one Fiscal Year which when added to the Shares subject to any other Plan Award denominated in Shares
granted to such Non-Management Director in the same Fiscal Year would exceed a Share value of $500,000; provided, however,
that if the Performance Period applicable to a Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director exceeds twelve months, the
$500,000 limit shall apply to each 12-month period in the Performance Period. For sake of clarity, the $500,000 annual limit on
Shares subject to any Plan Award granted to a Non-Management Director applies to Options granted under Section 6.1, Stock
granted under Section 7.1, Restricted Stock granted under Section 7.2, Restricted Stock Units granted under Section 8.1, Stock
Appreciation Rights granted under Section 9.1, and Performance Units granted under Section 10.1, but shall not include any Shares
granted in lieu of cash compensation earned by a Non-Management Director or any Shares received by a Non-Management Director
in settlement a Plan Award pursuant to Sections 6.3, 7.4, 8.3, 9.5, and 10.6.

ADMINISTRATION
4.1 Administration. The Committee will administer the Plan and will grant all Plan Awards; provided that solely for purposes of

(a)

Duties and Powers. The Committee shall have these duties and powers as to the Plan:
to establish rules, procedures, and forms governing the Plan;

(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
(g)

(h)

(i)
(j)

to interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and any Plan Award;
to recommend amendments of the Plan to the Board;
to determine those individuals who will be Recipients and what Plan Awards will be made to them;
to set the terms and conditions of any Plan Award and to determine and certify whether, and the extent to which, any such
terms and conditions have been satisfied;
to determine the Fair Market Value of the Shares for any purpose;
to amend the terms of any Plan Award without the consent of the Recipient or any other person or to waive any conditions or
obligations of a Recipient under or with respect to any Plan Award; provided that no amendment that, in the judgment of the
Committee would materially adversely affect the Recipient shall be made without the Recipient’s consent; provided further
that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of the Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the
Recipient;
to make such adjustments or modifications to Plan Awards to Recipients who are working outside the United States as are
advisable to fulfill the purposes of the Plan or to comply with applicable local law and to establish, amend and terminate subplans for individuals outside the United States with such provisions as are consistent with the Plan as may be suitable in other
jurisdictions to the extent permitted under local law;
to correct any defect or supply any omission; and
take any other action it deems necessary or advisable.

Notwithstanding the authority of the Committee under this Section 4.2 and notwithstanding any other discretionary power granted to
the Committee under the Plan, except in connection with any corporate transaction involving Walmart, the terms of outstanding Plan
Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel outstanding
Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Plan Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an
exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights without the prior approval of
Walmart stockholders.
4.3
Delegation. Except for the administration of Qualified Performance Based Awards and matters under the Plan affected by
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules adopted thereunder, the Committee may delegate ministerial duties under the Plan
(including but not limited to the duties described in Section 4.2(h)) to one or more administrators, who may be Associates of
Walmart, and may delegate non-ministerial duties to an officer of Walmart; provided that the delegate of non-ministerial duties (a)
shall not be authorized to make Plan Awards to himself or herself, and (b) in any Fiscal Year shall not make Plan Awards in excess
of 100,000 Shares in the aggregate or 1,000 Shares to any one Recipient.
The Committee has delegated its powers, duties, and authority under the Plan (including the power to delegate, but not including the
power to recommend amendments under Section 4.2(c)) with respect to Associates who are not Section 16 Persons, and other than
Covered Employees whose awards are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, to the Global Compensation Committee
of the Board.
The Board may also delegate administration of the Plan or a particular feature of the Plan to another Committee of the Board.

Any delegated authority, duty or power may be revoked at any time by the delegator as it deems appropriate. Any delegated
authority, duty or power may be exercised by the delegator as well as the delegate; provided, however, that in the event of any
conflict between the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the delegator and the exercise of any authority, duty or power by the
delegate, the exercise by the delegator shall govern.
4.4 Determinations Binding. All actions taken or determinations made by the Committee, in good faith, with respect to the Plan,
a Plan Award or any Notice of Plan Award shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
all persons interested in the Plan or any Plan Award.
PARTICIPATION
5.1 All Associates and Non-Management Directors who the Committee determines have the potential to contribute significantly to
the success of Walmart or an Affiliate, are eligible to participate in the Plan, except that Non-Management Directors may not receive
Incentive Stock Options. An Associate may be granted one or more Plan Awards, unless prohibited by applicable law and subject to
the limitations under Code Section 422 with respect to Incentive Stock Options. For any Performance Period for which Plan Awards
are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the Committee shall designate the Associates eligible to be granted Plan
Awards no later than the 90th day of the Fiscal Year (or in the case of a Performance Period other than a Fiscal Year, after not later
than the date 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed).
STOCK OPTIONS
6.1
Term of Options. Walmart may grant Options covering Subject Shares to Associates and Non-Management Directors. The
term of each Option shall be the term stated in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock
Option, the term shall be no more than 10 years from the date of grant unless the Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Recipient
who, at the time of the grant, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any
Parent/Subsidiary Corporation, in which case the term may not exceed 5 years from the date of grant.
Each Option shall be a Nonqualified Option unless designated otherwise in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding the
designation of an Option, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares subject to Incentive Stock Options that are exercisable for the
first time by a Recipient during a calendar year exceeds $100,000 (whether due to the terms of the Plan Award, acceleration of
exercisability, miscalculation or error), or if such Option for any other reason fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, the
excess Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options.
6.2 Option Exercise Price and Consideration. The per Share exercise price of an Option shall be determined by the Committee
in its discretion, except that the per Share exercise price for an Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the date of grant except that, with respect to an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Associate who owns stock
representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of Walmart or any Parent/Subsidiary Corporation at the time
of the grant, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. The
type of consideration in which the exercise price of an Option is to be paid shall be determined by the

Committee in its discretion, and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant.
6.3 Exercise of Options. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when the person entitled to exercise the Option gives notice
of exercise to Walmart in accordance with the Option’s terms and Walmart receives full payment for the Shares as to which the
Option is exercised or other provision for such payment is made in accordance with rules and procedures established by the
Committee from time to time. Except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, such rules and procedures may include procedures for
a “net-share settlement” method of exercise, under which, subject to the method requirements in the rules and procedures, the
Recipient provides an irrevocable notice of exercise of the Option and Walmart retains a number of Shares sufficient to cover the
exercise price and the minimum required withholding, and delivers the net number of Shares to the Recipient. In addition, if
determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among Recipients or Plan Awards, an Option will
be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the
Recipient’s Option under Section 11.6) on the expiration date of the Option, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the
last day prior to the expiration date on which the NYSE is open, using a net share settlement method of exercise to the extent that as
of such expiration date the Option is vested and exercisable and the per Share exercise price of the Option is below the Fair Market
Value of a Share on such expiration date.
6.4 Termination of Employment. If a Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, the Recipient
may exercise Options that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date to the extent set out in the Recipient’s Notice of
Plan Award. Incentive Stock Options may be exercised only within 60 days (or other period of time determined by the Committee at
the time of grant of the Option and not exceeding 3 months) after the date of the termination (but in no event later than the expiration
date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), and only to the extent that Recipient was entitled to exercise
the Incentive Stock Option at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not exercise an Option
at the date of that termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan Award, the Option shall terminate. In
addition, the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the
existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with,
or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the
tolling period will end and the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the
exercise date of an Option be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status plus
the tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding any provision in
the Plan to the contrary, an Associate’s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate’s Options if immediately
upon the termination of the Associate’s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate the Associate becomes a NonManagement Director.
6.5
Administrative Suspension from Employment. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative
suspension from employment, the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be suspended. If upon the conclusion of the
administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient’s right to exercise Options will be reinstated

subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of an Option be
later than the expiration date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award.
6.6 Disability of Recipient. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.4, in the case of an Associate’s Incentive Stock Option,
if the Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated as a result of his or her total and permanent disability (as defined in Code Section
22(e)(3)), the Recipient may, but only within 12 months from the date of that termination (but in no event later than the expiration
date of the term of that Option as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award), exercise an Incentive Stock Option to the extent otherwise
entitled to exercise it at the date of that termination. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to exercise an Incentive Stock Option
at the date of termination, or if Recipient does not exercise that Incentive Stock Option to the extent so entitled within the time
specified herein, the Incentive Stock Option shall terminate.
6.7
Non-transferability of Options . An Option may not be sold, pledged, hedged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or
disposed of in any manner except by testamentary devise or by the laws of descent or distribution or, in those circumstances
expressly permitted by the Committee, to a Permitted Transferee. For this purpose, a “Permitted Transferee” means any member of
the Immediate Family of the Recipient, any trust of which all of the primary beneficiaries are the Recipient or members of his or her
Immediate Family or any partnership of which all of the partners or members are the Recipient or members of his or her Immediate
Family. The “Immediate Family” of a Recipient means the Recipient’s spouse, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents,
stepparents, siblings, grandparents, nieces and nephews, or the spouse of any of the foregoing individuals.

taxes upon any taxable event relating to an Option in accordance with Section 11.10 except to the extent otherwise provided under
Section 6.3.

then existing as to the Recipient’s Restricted Stock, receive the proceeds of the Restricted Stock in any stock split, reverse stock
split, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of Walmart, which proceeds shall automatically and without need for
any other action become Restricted Stock and be delivered as provided in Section 7.4, and (c) the Recipient shall be entitled to vote

7.4

Delivery of Shares. Subject to any deferral election under Section 7.8, a Share will be

delivered to the Recipient upon, or as soon as practicable after, the lapse of the Restrictions on a Share of Restricted Stock. Shares
awarded under Section 7.1 shall be delivered immediately upon issuance of any such Plan Award. During the period of Restriction
applicable to Restricted Stock, the Recipient shall not have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any
security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Restricted Stock or any interest therein. As a result of
the retention of rights in the Restricted Stock by Walmart, except as required by any law, neither any Shares of the Restricted Stock
nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge,
hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the
direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any
bankruptcy or other creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
7.5
Forfeiture. Unless expressly provided for in the Plan Award, any Restricted Stock held by the Recipient at the time the
Recipient ceases to be an Associate or Non-Management Director for any reason shall be forfeited by the Recipient to Walmart and
automatically re-conveyed to Walmart.
7.6
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to a Plan Award or the exercise or settlement thereof.
7.7 Evidence of Share Ownership. The Restricted Stock will be book-entry Shares held for the benefit of the Recipient with stop
transfer instructions on Walmart’s stop transfer records until the Restrictions lapse, at which time Walmart will remove stop transfer
instructions from the Shares on its stock transfer records.
7.8 Deferral of Shares or Restricted Stock. At the time of grant of Shares or Restricted Stock (or at such earlier or later time as
the Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit a Recipient
of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to defer his or her Stock or Restricted Stock in accordance with rules
and procedures established by the Committee. Alternatively, the Committee may, in its discretion and at the times provided above,
permit an individual who would have been a Recipient of a Plan Award of Shares or a Plan Award of Restricted Stock to elect
instead to receive an equivalent Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units to be settled in Shares and may permit the Recipient to elect to
defer receipt of Shares under such Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section 8.7.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
8.1
Grant of Restricted Stock Units. Walmart may grant Restricted Stock Units to those Associates and Non-Management
Directors as the Committee may select in its sole discretion. Each Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units shall have those terms and
conditions that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and the Notice of Plan Award, as the Committee may determine
in its discretion. The Restrictions imposed shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A.
8.2
Beneficial Ownership. Until the Restricted Stock Unit is released from Restrictions and settled in Shares or cash, the
Recipient shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares

subject to the Restricted Stock Unit, nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant
any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any Restricted Stock Unit or any interest therein.
Except as required by any law, no Restricted Stock Unit nor any interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or
involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation, encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability,
debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any
proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any
transaction of that type shall be void.
8.3
Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Upon the lapse of the Restrictions, the Recipient of Restricted Stock Units shall,
except as noted below, be entitled to receive, as soon as administratively practical, (a) that number of Shares subject to the Plan
Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, (b) in cash in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the number of Shares
subject to the Plan Award that are no longer subject to Restrictions, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee
shall determine in its sole discretion and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. Where in the judgment of the Committee, it is
in the interests of Walmart to do so, a grant of Restricted Stock Units may provide that Walmart or an Affiliate may purchase Shares
on the open market on behalf of a Recipient in accordance with Section 11.1 (“Open Market Shares”).
8.4 Forfeiture. Restricted Stock Units and the entitlement to Shares, cash, or any combination thereunder will be forfeited and all
rights of an Associate or Non-Management Director to such Restricted Stock Units and the Shares thereunder will terminate if the
applicable Restrictions are not satisfied.
8.5 Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Restricted Stock Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting
rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan. The Committee may, however, provide in the
Notice of Plan Award that the Recipient shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalent payments on Restricted Stock Units, on such
terms and conditions as the Notice of Plan Award shall specify.
8.6
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Restricted Stock Units.
8.7
Deferral of Restricted Stock Units . At the time of grant of Restricted Stock Units (or at such earlier or later time as the
Committee determines to be appropriate in light of the provisions of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to
elect to defer receipt of the Shares or cash to be delivered upon lapse of the Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units in
accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax
treatment under Code Section 409A, and may provide for payment in Shares or cash.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
9.1 Grant. Walmart may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as the Committee
selects in its sole discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. A Recipient granted a Stock Appreciation
Right will be entitled to receive payment as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award in an amount equal to (a) the excess of the Fair
Market Value of a Share on the date on which the Recipient properly

exercises Stock Appreciation Rights that are no longer subject to Restrictions over the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of
grant of the Recipient’s Stock Appreciation Rights, (b) a predetermined amount that is less than that excess, or (c) with respect to
Recipients who are exempt from U.S. taxation and who are expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan Award is
settled, any other amount as may be set by the Committee, multiplied by the number of Stock Appreciation Rights as to which the
Recipient exercises the Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee may provide that payment with respect to an exercised Stock
Appreciation Right may occur on a date which is different than the exercise date, and may provide for additional payment in
recognition of the time value of money and any delay between the exercise date and the payment date.
9.2
Award Vesting and Forfeiture. The Committee shall establish the Restrictions, if any, applicable to Stock Appreciation
Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights and the entitlement to Shares thereunder will be forfeited and all rights of the Recipient to such
Stock Appreciation Rights and the Shares thereunder will terminate if any applicable Restrictions in the Plan or Notice of Plan
Award are not satisfied.
9.3 Beneficial Ownership. The Recipient of any Stock Appreciation Rights shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares
subject to such Plan Awards until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Plan Award nor shall the Recipient have the right to sell,
transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose of or encumber any
Stock Appreciation Rights or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Stock Appreciation Rights nor any
interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hedge, hypothecation,
encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect
result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other
creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
9.4
Election to Receive Payments. A Recipient of a Stock Appreciation Right may elect to receive a payment to which the
Recipient is entitled under the Plan Award by giving notice of such election to the Committee in accordance with the rules
established by the Committee. In addition, if determined by the Committee in its discretion, which may be applied differently among
Recipients or Plan Awards, a Stock Appreciation Right will be deemed exercised by the Recipient (or in the event of the death of the
Recipient then by the person authorized to exercise the Recipient’s Stock Appreciation Right under Section 11.6) on the expiration
date of the Stock Appreciation Right, or if the NYSE is not open on the expiration date, on the last day prior to the expiration date on
which the NYSE is open, to the extent that as of such expiration date the Stock Appreciation Right is vested and exercisable and to
the extent that, if the Recipient exercised such Stock Appreciation Right, the Recipient would receive a payment under Section 9.5.
9.5
Payments to Recipients. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan Award granting the Stock Appreciation
Rights, a payment to a Recipient with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights may be made (a) in cash, (b) in Shares having an
aggregate Fair Market Value on the date on which the Stock Appreciation Rights are settled equal to the amount of the payment to
be made under the Plan Award, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion
and specify at the time the Plan Award is granted. The Committee shall not make any payment in Shares if such payment would
result in

any adverse tax or other legal effect as to this Plan or Walmart.
9.6 Termination of Continuous Status. If a Recipient’s Continuous Status is terminated for any reason other than Cause, then,
Recipient may elect payment with respect to Stock Appreciation Rights that are not subject to Restrictions as of the termination date
to the extent set out in the Recipient’s Notice of Plan Award. To the extent the Recipient is not entitled to or does not elect payment
with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right at the date of termination or within the time specified herein or in the Notice of Plan
Award, the Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate. In addition, the Recipient’s right to exercise Stock Appreciation Rights will be
tolled pending any period initiated by the Committee to determine the existence of Cause with respect to the Recipient regardless of
whether the commencement of such period is prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to the termination of the Recipient’s
Continuous Status. If the Committee determines there is no Cause, then the tolling period will end and the Recipient’s right to elect
payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated; provided, however, in no event will the exercise date of a Stock
Appreciation Right be later than the earlier of (a) 90 days following the termination of the Recipient’s Continuous Status plus the
tolling period, or (b) the expiration date of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in the Notice of Plan Award. Notwithstanding
any provision in the Plan to the contrary, an Associate’s Continuous Status is not terminated for purposes of the Associate’s Stock
Appreciation Rights if immediately upon the termination of the Associate’s employment relationship with Walmart or an Affiliate
the Associate becomes a Non-Management Director.
9.7
Administrative Suspension from Employment. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative
suspension from employment, the Recipient’s right to elect payment of Stock Appreciation Rights will be suspended. If upon the
conclusion of the administrative suspension the Recipient returns to employment, then the Recipient’s right to elect payment of
Stock Appreciation Rights will be reinstated subject to Restrictions set forth in the Notice of Plan Award; provided, however, in no
event will the date of the payment election be later than the expiration date of the term of the Stock Appreciation Right as set forth in
the Notice of Plan Award.
9.8
Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Stock Appreciation Rights is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g.,
voting rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of such Shares pursuant to the Plan.
9.9
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to the Stock Appreciation Rights.
9.10 Deferral of Stock Appreciation Rights. At the time of grant of a Plan Award of Stock Appreciation Rights the Committee
may permit a Recipient who is exempt from U.S. taxation and who is expected to remain exempt from U.S. taxation until the Plan
Award is settled to elect to defer the Shares or cash to be delivered in settlement of a Stock Appreciation Right in accordance with
rules and procedures established by the Committee.
PERFORMANCE UNITS
10.1 Grant. Walmart may grant Performance Units to those Associates and Non-Management Directors as it may select in its sole
discretion, on any terms and conditions the Committee deems desirable. Each Plan Award of Performance Units shall have those
terms and conditions

that are expressly set forth in, or are required by, the Plan and Notice of Plan Award.
10.2
Performance Goals. The Committee shall set Performance Goals which, depending on the extent to which they are met
during a Performance Period, will determine the number of Performance Units that will be earned by the Recipient at the end of the
Performance Period. The Performance Goals shall be set at threshold, target and maximum performance levels, with the number of
Performance Units to be earned tied to the degree of attainment of the various performance levels under the various Performance
Goals during the Performance Period. No Performance Units will be earned if the threshold performance level is not attained.
10.3 Beneficial Ownership. The Recipient of Performance Units shall not have any beneficial ownership in any Shares subject to
the Performance Units unless and until Shares are delivered in satisfaction of the Performance Units nor shall the Recipient have the
right to sell, transfer, assign, convey, pledge, hedge, hypothecate, grant any security interest in or mortgage on, or otherwise dispose
of or encumber any Performance Units or any interest therein. Except as required by any law, neither the Performance Units nor any
interest therein shall be subject in any manner to any forced or involuntary sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hypothecation,
encumbrance, or other disposition or to any charge, liability, debt, or obligation of the Recipient, whether as the direct or indirect
result of any action of the Recipient or any action taken in any proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other
creditors’ rights law. Any action attempting to effect any transaction of that type shall be void.
10.4
Determination of Achievement of Performance Goals. The Committee shall, promptly after the date on which the
necessary financial, individual or other information for a particular Performance Period becomes available, determine and certify the
degree to which each of the Performance Goals have been attained.
10.5 Settlement of Performance Units. After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the Recipient of Performance Units
shall be entitled to payment based on the performance level attained with respect to the Performance Goals applicable to the
Performance Units. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, reduce, eliminate or increase any amount of Shares or cash earned
under Performance Units for any individual or group, except that such amount of Shares or cash intended to be a Qualified
Performance Based Award may not be increased above the amount provided in the Notice of Plan Award. Unless deferred in
accordance with Section 10.9, Performance Units shall be settled as soon as practicable after the Committee determines and certifies
the degree of attainment of Performance Goals for the Performance Period.
The Committee shall have the discretion and authority to make adjustments to any Performance Units in circumstances where,
during the Performance Period: (a) a Recipient leaves Walmart or an Affiliate and is subsequently rehired; (b) a Recipient transfers
between positions with different incentive percentages or Performance Goals; (c) a Recipient transfers to a position not eligible to
participate in the Plan; (d) a Recipient becomes eligible, or ceases to be eligible, for an incentive from another incentive plan
maintained by Walmart or an Affiliate; (e) a Recipient is on a leave of absence; and (f) similar circumstances deemed appropriate by
the Committee, consistent with the purpose and terms of the Plan; provided however, that the Committee shall not be authorized to
increase the amount of Performance Units payable to a Covered Employee that would otherwise be payable if the amount was
intended to be Qualified Performance Based Award.
10.6

Payments to Recipients. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Notice of Plan

Award, payment to a Recipient with respect to Performance Units may be made (a) in Shares, (b) in cash or by check equal to the
Shares’ Fair Market Value on the date the Performance Units are settled, or (c) any combination of cash and Shares, as the
Committee shall determine at any time in its sole discretion.
10.7
Limitation of Rights. A Recipient of Performance Units is not entitled to any rights of a holder of the Shares (e.g. voting
rights and dividend rights), prior to the receipt of Shares pursuant to the settlement of the Plan Award (if the Plan Award is settled in
Shares). No dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to Performance Units.
10.8
Withholding. The Committee may withhold in accordance with Section 11.10 any amounts necessary to collect any
withholding taxes upon any taxable event relating to Performance Units.
10.9
Deferral of Shares or Cash Payout. At the time of grant of Performance Units (or at such earlier or later time as the
Committee determines to be appropriate in light of Code Section 409A) the Committee may permit the Recipient to elect to defer
delivery of Shares (or payment of cash) with respect to the Plan Award in accordance with such rules and procedures established by
the Committee. Such rules and procedures shall take into account potential tax treatment under Code Section 409A.
MISCELLANEOUS
11.1

Issuance of Stock Certificates; Book-Entry; or Purchase of Shares.

(a)

If a Recipient has the right to the delivery of any Shares pursuant to any Plan Award, Walmart shall issue or cause to be
issued a stock certificate or a book-entry crediting Shares to the Recipient’s account promptly upon the exercise of the Plan
Award or the right arising under the Plan Award.

(b)

A Recipient’s right to Open Market Shares pursuant to settlement of a Plan Award of Restricted Stock Units or Performance
Units shall not be satisfied by Walmart’s delivery of Shares but rather Walmart or an Affiliate shall purchase the Shares on
the open market on behalf of the Recipient by forwarding cash to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares
on the open market on behalf of the Recipient.

11.2

Compliance with Code Section 162(m).

(a)

To the extent awards to Covered Employees are intended to be Qualified Performance Based Awards, the material terms of
the Performance Goals under which awards are paid (and any material changes in material terms) shall be disclosed to and
approved by Walmart’s stockholders in a separate vote. Material terms include the eligible Recipients specified in Section
5.1, the Performance Measures pursuant to which the Performance Goals are set, and the maximum amount of compensation
that could be paid to any Covered Employee or the formula used to calculate the amount of compensation to be paid to the
Covered Employee if the Performance Goal is attained.

(b)

Performance Measures must be disclosed to and reapproved by the stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting
that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which stockholders previously approved the Performance Measures. If
applicable laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without conditioning
deductibility on obtaining stockholder approval (or reapproval) of any

changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make changes without obtaining stockholder approval or reapproval.
(c)

Whenever the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant or pay awards that do not qualify as Qualified Performance
Based Awards, the Committee may make grants or payments without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m).

(d)

The Committee may, but shall not be required to, establish rules and procedures providing for the automatic deferral of
Shares or other Plan payouts of Recipients who are Covered Employees as necessary to avoid a loss of deduction under Code
Section 162(m)(1).

11.3
Termination of Employment or Interruption or Termination of Continuous Status. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in the Plan, the Committee shall determine the effect of the termination of an Associate’s employment, or a Recipient’s
disability or death, or any other interruption or termination of Continuous Status, on the lapse of any Restrictions contained in a Plan
Award made to the Recipient. During a period for which the Recipient is subject to administrative suspension, a Recipient’s right to
exercise or receive payment for any rights under any Plan Award or the vesting of any rights under any Plan Award shall be
suspended to the extent permitted under local law.
11.4
Forfeiture for Cause. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, any Recipient upon a finding of
“Cause” by the Committee shall forfeit all Plan Awards (and rights thereunder) granted under the Plan, whether or not vested or
otherwise exercisable.
11.5

Repayment Obligation.

(a)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, in the event the Committee or its delegate (which expressly
may include any officer of Walmart or a non-Associate third party (such as counsel to Walmart)) determines that a Recipient
has engaged in Gross Misconduct, then the Recipient shall forfeit all Plan Awards then outstanding, and the Recipient shall
repay to Walmart any payments received from Walmart with respect to any Plan Awards subsequent to the date which is
twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of the behavior serving as the basis for the finding of Gross Misconduct. Any
amount to be repaid by a Recipient pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be held by the Recipient in constructive trust for the
benefit of Walmart and shall be paid by the Recipient to Walmart with interest at the prime rate (as published in The Wall
Street Journal ) as of the date the Committee or its delegate determines the Recipient engaged in Gross Misconduct. The
amount to be repaid pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be determined on a gross basis, without reduction for any taxes
incurred, as of the date of payment to the Recipient, and without regard to any subsequent change in the Fair Market Value of
a Share.

(b)

If the Committee determines at any time that the Recipient of a Plan Award, prior to or within one year after the date of
settlement of such Plan Award, (A) engaged in any act the Committee deems inimical to the best interest of Walmart or an
Affiliate, (B) breached any restrictive covenant or confidentiality requirement to which the Recipient was subject; or (C)
otherwise failed to comply with applicable policies of Walmart or an Affiliate at all times prior to the settlement of the Plan
Award, the Recipient shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the amount paid or distributed in settlement of such Plan
Award to Walmart. In addition, all Plan Awards, whether or not previously settled,

and whether or not previously deferred, shall be subject to Walmart’s policies, including Walmart’s Statement of
Ethics or requirements of applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance) regarding clawbacks
(recoupment) as in effect from time to time.
11.6
Death of Recipient. To the extent permitted in the Notice of Plan Award or under Committee rules and procedures, a
Recipient may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid, or who is authorized to
exercise the Recipient’s Plan Award, in the event of the death of the Recipient, subject to Committee rules and procedures. If no
such beneficiary is effectively named by the Recipient for any reason, then except to the extent otherwise provided in the Notice of
Plan Award or Committee rules and procedures, if the Recipient dies, the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid to the Recipient’s
estate or may be exercised, in accordance with its terms or as allowed by law, by the Recipient’s estate or by the beneficiary or
person to whom the award devolves by bequest or inheritance. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice of Plan Award, (a) Plan
Awards may be exercised after death only to the extent the Recipient was otherwise entitled to exercise the Plan Award at the date of
the Recipient’s death and only if exercised within 12 months after the Recipient’s death, and (b) to the extent a Plan Award was
unvested at the date of death, the Plan Award shall terminate.
11.7
Limitations on Liability and Award Obligations. Receiving a Plan Award or being the owner of any Option, Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Stock Appreciation Right, or Performance Unit shall not:
(a)

give a Recipient any rights except as expressly set forth in the Plan or in the Plan Award and except as a stockholder of
Walmart as set forth herein as to the Restricted Stock only;

(b)

as to Shares deliverable on the exercise of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or in settlement of Performance Units or
Restricted Stock Units, until the delivery (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of Walmart of a duly
authorized transfer agent of Walmart) of such Shares, give the Recipient the right to vote, or receive dividends on, or exercise
any other rights as a stockholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise (in the case of Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights) of the related Plan Award;

(c)

be considered a contract of employment or give the Recipient any right to continued employment, or to hold any position,
with Walmart or any Affiliate;

(d)

create any fiduciary or other obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to take any action or provide to the Recipient any
assistance or dedicate or permit the use of any assets of Walmart or any Affiliate that would permit the Recipient to be able
to attain any performance criteria stated in the Recipient’s Plan Award;

(e)

create any trust, fiduciary or other duty or obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate to engage in any particular business,
continue to engage in any particular business, engage in any particular business practices or sell any particular product or
products;

(f)

create any obligation of Walmart or any Affiliate that shall be greater than the obligations of Walmart or that Affiliate to any
general unsecured creditor of Walmart or the Affiliate; or

(g)

give a Recipient any right to receive any additional Plan Award of any type.

If Walmart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient’s employment with Walmart or the Affiliate, the potential value of any Plan Award
that must be returned to Walmart will not be an element of any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination of
employment or other relationship in violation of any contractual or other rights the Recipient may have.
11.8 No Liability of Committee Members. Walmart shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each
other officer and director of Walmart or any Affiliate that has any duty or power relating to the administration of the Plan against
any liability, obligation, cost or expense incurred by that person arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan
or any Plan Award if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of
Walmart. Indemnification of Associates, directors, and agents shall be determined pursuant to the requirements of Article VI of
Walmart’s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
11.9 Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger. Subject to any required action by the Walmart stockholders, the
number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) covered by each Plan Award, and the number and type of Shares (or
other securities or property) which have been authorized for delivery under the Plan but as to which no Plan Awards have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of a Plan Award, the price per Share covered by any
outstanding Plan Award that includes in its terms a price per Share, and the number of Shares with respect to which Plan Awards
may be granted to an individual shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect an extraordinary dividend or other distribution (whether
in the form of cash, Shares or other securities or property), stock split, reverse stock split, merger, reorganization, subdivision,
consolidation or reduction of capital, recapitalization, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or reclassification of the Shares,
or any other increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by Walmart, issuance
or warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of Walmart or other similar corporate transaction or event that
affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. That adjustment shall be made by the
Committee, whose determination shall be final, binding and conclusive as to every person interested under the Plan. Except as
expressly provided herein, no issuance by Walmart of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of
any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to a
Plan Award.
11.10 Tax Withholding. Whenever taxes are to be withheld in connection with the grant, vesting, lapse of restrictions, exercise or
settlement of a Plan Award or for any other reason in connection with a Plan Award (the date on which such withholding obligation
arises being hereinafter referred to as the “Tax Date”), the Committee may decide, in its sole discretion, to provide for the payment
for the withholding of federal, state and local taxes (including Social Security and Medicare (“FICA”) taxes by one or a combination
of the following methods and may (but need not) permit the Recipient to elect the method or methods: (a) payment in cash of the
amount to be withheld, (b) requesting Walmart to withhold from Shares that would otherwise be delivered in settlement of a Plan
Award payable in Shares (or upon the lapse of Restrictions on a Plan Award) a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the
Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date no greater than the amount to be withheld, (c) transfer of

unencumbered Shares owned by the Recipient in circumstances permitted by the Committee valued at their Fair Market Value on the
Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date, (d) withholding from any cash compensation otherwise due to the
Recipient; or (e) such other method as authorized by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee may set limits on the amount of
withholding to be satisfied through withholding of Shares; e.g., the Committee may require that only the minimum withholding be
satisfied in Shares, and may prohibit withholding from Open Market Shares or using a particular method if necessary or advisable in
a particular country. Any fractional share amount must be paid in cash or withheld from compensation otherwise due to the
Recipient.
11.11 Amendment and Termination of the Plan. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time without the approval
of the Recipients or any other person, except to the extent any action of that type is required to be approved by the stockholders of
Walmart under applicable law, listing standards, or in connection with any outstanding Qualified Performance Based Awards.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment that, in the judgment of the Board would materially adversely affect a Recipient
holding an Award shall be made without the Recipient’s consent; provided that no amendment that changes the timing of taxation of
a Plan Award shall be deemed to materially adversely affect the Recipient.
11.12 Compliance with Law. The making of any Plan Award or delivery of any Shares is subject to compliance by Walmart with
all applicable laws as determined by Walmart’s legal counsel. Walmart need not issue or transfer any Plan Award or Shares pursuant
to the Plan unless Walmart’s legal counsel has approved all legal matters in connection with the delivery of any Plan Award or
Shares.
11.13 No Representation or Warranty Regarding Tax Treatment. Notwithstanding any language contained in the Plan or any
Plan Award, Walmart does not represent or warrant that any particular tax treatment will be achieved.
11.14

Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

11.15 Superseding Existing Plans, Effective Date, and Transition. The Plan, as set forth herein, was approved by the Board on
February 6, 2015, to be effective on June 5, 2015, subject to the approval of Walmart’s stockholders. The 2013 Restatement was
approved by the Board on April 12, 2013, to be effective August 12, 2013. The 2010 Plan was effective January 1, 2010, and
approved by Walmart’s stockholders on June 4, 2010. The 2005 Plan was effective January 1, 2005, and was approved by Walmart’s
stockholders on June 3, 2005. The 1998 Plan was effective as of March 5, 1998, and was approved by Walmart’s stockholders on
June 5, 1998. Shares made available for delivery in settlement of Plan Awards shall also be available for delivery in settlement of
amounts payable under the provisions of the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Director Compensation Deferral Plan.
11.16
Funding. To the extent the Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), it is
intended to be (and will be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly
compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. It is intended that the Plan be unfunded for federal tax purposes and for
purposes of Title I of ERISA.
11.17 Code Section 409A. Plan Awards are intended to be exempt from the definition of “nonqualified deferred compensation”
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, or to the extent

not so exempt, to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the Plan and Plan Awards shall be interpreted accordingly.

WALMART DEFERRED COMPENSATION MATCHING PLAN
ARTICLE I.
GENERAL
1.1

Purpose.

The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation
and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to
the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by
providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan.
1.2

Effective Date.
The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2016.

1.3

Nature of Plan.

The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of
management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and
for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A
Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any
Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive
payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart.
The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in
accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder.

4

(z)

Scheduled In-Service Account means a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of a Participant to which the

3.5. The number of Scheduled In-Service Accounts a Participant may have under the Plan at any time shall be

of the second Plan Year beginning after the Plan Year for which Deferral Credits are first allocated to such Scheduled
In-Service Account. Once selected, the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to any Scheduled In-Service Account is
irrevocable. If a Participant fails to designate a Scheduled Pay Date with respect to a Scheduled In-Service Account,
then the Participant is deemed to have designated as the Scheduled Pay Date for such Scheduled In-Service Account
the first day of the second Plan Year beginning after the Plan Year for which Deferral Credits are first allocated to
such Scheduled In-Service Account.

(bb)

Separation from Service means the Participant has a termination of employment (other than on account of death)
with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph, “Company” means the Employer and any Related Affiliate.

indicate the Participant and the Company reasonably anticipate that no further services will be performed by the
Participant for the Company; provided, however, that a Participant shall be deemed to have a termination of
employment if the level of services he or she actually performs for the Company after a certain date permanently
decreases to no more than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of bona fide services performed for the
Company by the Participant (whether as an employee or independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36month period (or the full period of services for the Company if the Participant has been providing services to the
Company for less than 36 months). For this purpose, a Participant is not treated as having a Separation from Service
while he or she is on a military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence, if the period of such leave does
not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Participant has a right to reemployment with the Company
under an applicable statute or by contract. This definition of Separation from Service is intended to be consistent with
the separation from service requirements as defined in Code Section 409A.

(cc)

Separation Pay Date means the last day of the calendar month in which falls the date that is six (6) months after a
Participant’s Separation from Service.

(dd)

Special Bonus means a bonus, other than a bonus payable under the MIP, that is payable to an Eligible Officer with
respect to services rendered or to be rendered for an Employer and that is eligible for deferral under the Plan either
because (1) the bonus is payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by the
5

Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the
bonus by explicit reference to this Plan or (2) the bonus is eligible for deferral in accordance with guidelines
established by the Committee, or by an officer to whom the Committee has delegated authority to establish such
guidelines, and the bonus requires as a condition of receipt of the bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the bonus that the
recipient continue to perform services for the Employer for a period of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he
or she obtains the legally binding right to the bonus.
(ee)

Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident
of the Participant, the Participant’s spouse, the Participant’s beneficiary, or the Participant’s dependent (as defined in
Code Section 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) and (d)(1)(B)), the loss of the Participant’s property
due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond
the control of the Participant.

(ff)

Valuation Date means each day of the Plan Year.

(gg)

Walmart means Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

(hh)

Years of Participation means a period of Plan Years which includes the first Plan Year with respect to which an
Eligible Participant makes a deferral election in accordance with any one or more of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 and an
amount is credited to the Participant’s Account with respect to any such deferral election, and each subsequent Plan
Year during all or part of which the Participant remains a Participant. In addition to the preceding definition, a
Participant’s Years of Participation shall include any period commencing February 1 and ending January 31, whether
before or after the effective date of the Plan, during which or with respect to which an account is maintained for the
Participant under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Officer Deferred Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from
time to time.

ARTICLE III.
DEFERRAL CREDITS AND MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CREDITS AND ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS
3.1 Deferred Compensation.
(a)

For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer, as Deferred Compensation, all or a portion of the
Eligible Officer’s Compensation to be otherwise paid for such Plan Year by the Employer, provided, however, that no
election shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an Eligible Officer to an amount which is less
than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or
local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) or for insurance premiums or other
withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A.
6

The Eligible Officer’s Deferred Compensation will be deferred proratably for each payroll period of the Plan Year. If
a payroll period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Deferred Compensation with
respect to such payroll period shall be determined by the Eligible Officer’s deferral election made with respect to the
Plan Year in which the payroll period ends. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with
Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive
Compensation.
(b)

Compensation deferral elections must be filed:
(1)
(2)

With respect to an individual who is an Eligible Officer as of the December 31 preceding the Plan Year for
which the deferral election is to be effective, no later than such December 31; or
With respect to an individual who first becomes an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year, within thirty (30)
days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Officer. For purposes of this rule, an Eligible
Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year only if:
(A)

he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date
during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Officer; or

(B)

he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code
Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was
not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment.

A deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only with respect to Compensation for payroll
periods beginning after the payroll period in which the Eligible Officer’s election form (which may be
electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. In addition, a deferral election
under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only if the deferral election meets the requirements set forth in
Code Section 409A(a)(4)(B).
(c)

The Deferred Compensation of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s
Compensation under this Section 3.1 with respect to a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral
Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in
accordance with Section 3.5.
7

3.2 Deferred MIP Bonuses.
(a)

For each Plan Year, each Eligible Participant may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s bonus (if
any) to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Participant under the MIP with respect to a performance period under the
MIP that coincides with the Plan Year or that ends within the Plan Year; provided, however, an Eligible Participant
who is not an Eligible Officer may elect to defer no more than eighty percent (80%) of the Eligible Participant’s MIP
bonus for a Plan Year. No election under this Section 3.2 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer
to an Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold
for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA
withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A. All bonus deferral
elections made under this Section 3.2 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms
(which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation.

(b)

MIP bonus deferral elections must be filed:
(1)

No later than the December 31 (or such other date as determined by the Committee or its delegate) preceding
the first day of the performance period for which the deferral election is to be effective.

(2)

If authorized by the Committee or its delegate with respect to an Eligible Participant, and if the MIP bonus
constitutes “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A based on services
performed over a performance period of at least twelve (12) months, and if the Eligible Participant has been
continuously employed by an Employer or a Related Affiliate since the first day of the performance period,
then no later than the earlier of (i) the date that is six months prior to the last day of the performance period, or
(ii) the date in the performance period as of which the amount of the MIP bonus has become both substantially
certain to be paid and calculable.

(3)

Solely with respect to an Eligible Officer who first becomes an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year,
within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Participant, as described in Code
Section 409A(a)(4)(B). For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an
Eligible Participant during the Plan Year only if:
(A)

he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date
during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Participant; or
8

(B)

he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code
Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was
not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment.

An MIP bonus deferral election under this Section 3.2(b)(3) will be effective only with respect to an MIP
bonus paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the MIP bonus payable
to the Eligible Officer for services rendered subsequent to the Eligible Officer’s election will be determined by
multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days remaining in the
performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in
such performance period. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b)(3), the date of an Eligible Officer’s election is
the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive
Compensation department.
(c)

The Deferred MIP Bonus of an Eligible Participant who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s
MIP bonus under this Section 3.2 with respect to a performance period that coincides with a Plan Year or that ends
within a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Participant’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be
allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5.

3.3 Deferred Special Bonuses.
(a)

An Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special Bonus to be otherwise paid to
the Eligible Officer in a Plan Year. All Special Bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.3 must be filed
with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive
Compensation. No election under this Section 3.3 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an
Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a
Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding)
for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A.For purposes of this Section 3.3, the
date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by
Executive Compensation. A deferral election is not permitted with respect to a Special Bonus unless the Special
Bonus is a type described in, and the deferral election with respect to the Special Bonus satisfies the applicable
conditions of, Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c).
9

(b)

A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) is one that: (1) requires as a condition of receipt of the Special
Bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the Special Bonus that the Eligible Officer continue to perform services for a period
of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he or she obtains the legally binding right to the Special Bonus; (2) may
not have an earlier vesting date for a good reason termination or the Eligible Officer’s retirement; and (3) must
otherwise meet the qualifications as described in Code Section 409A. The deferral election with respect to a Special
Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) must be filed within thirty (30) days after the Eligible Officer obtains the
legally binding right to the Special Bonus.

(c)

A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(c) is one payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by an
Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the Special
Bonus by explicit reference to the Plan. The deferral election with respect to a Special Bonus described in this Section
3.3(c) must be filed prior to the time the Eligible Officer renders any services to the Employer, regardless of whether
the deferral election relates to all of the Special Bonus or a portion of the Special Bonus.

(d)

The Deferred Special Bonus of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special
Bonus under this Section 3.3 otherwise payable in a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral
Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in
accordance with Section 3.5.

3.4 Employer Matching Contribution Credits.
(a)

If a Participant is employed by the Employer or any Related Affiliate on the last day of the Plan Year and if Deferral
Credits have been made to the Participant’s Account with respect to the Plan Year, then to the extent applicable under
the following provisions of this Section 3.4 an Employer Matching Contribution Credit will be made to the
Participant’s Matching Account. The amount of the Employer Matching Contribution Credit, if any, made to a
Participant’s Matching Account for the Plan Year will equal the total amount of Deferred Compensation and Deferred
MIP Bonus credited to the Participant’s Account for the Plan Year under Section 3.1(c) and Section 3.2(c); provided,
however, in no event shall the Employer Matching Contribution Credit made to a Participant’s Matching Account for
a Plan Year exceed 6% of the Participant’s Excess Compensation for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this Section 3.4(a), an Employer Matching Contribution Credit for a Plan Year shall not be made with
respect to any Deferral Credits for the Plan Year that have been withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.5.

(b)

A Participant shall become vested in his or her Matching Account, including earnings thereon, if the Participant has
completed at least three (3) Years of Participation. If a Participant is not otherwise vested in the Participant’s
Matching Account under the preceding sentence of this Section 3.4(b), the
10

Participant will become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account if the Participant dies prior to the
Participant’s Separation from Service, or if the Participant is Disabled. Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to
the contrary, a Participant’s Matching Account shall be distributed pursuant to Article V only if the Participant has
become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account under this Section 3.4(b) as of the date of the
Participant’s Separation from Service.
3.5 Account Allocation Elections.
(a)

At the same time that an Eligible Participant makes an election to defer Compensation, an MIP bonus, or a Special
Bonus in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate
the amount or amounts subject to each such deferral election to a Retirement Account or Accounts or to a Scheduled
In-Service Account or Accounts. In addition to the preceding requirement, at the same time that an Eligible
Participant makes an election to defer Compensation or an MIP bonus in accordance with the provisions of this Plan,
the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate the Employer Matching Contribution Credits (if any)
with respect to such Deferred Compensation or Deferred MIP Bonus to a Retirement Account or Accounts.

(b)

At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless
of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer
Matching Contribution Credit) to a Retirement Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the form of
distribution with respect to such Retirement Account. The form of distribution must be a form permitted under
Section 5.4(a).

(c)

At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless
of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus or Deferred Special Bonus) to a Scheduled
In-Service Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to such
Scheduled In-Service Account.

(d)

If at the time of an Eligible Participant’s deferral election under the Plan the Eligible Participant fails to make an
account allocation election under Section 3.5(a), then the amount subject to such deferral election shall be allocated in
the same manner as the same category of deferred amounts (meaning either Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP
Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer Matching Contribution Credits) were allocated for the most recent
preceding Plan Year for which the Eligible Participant made an allocation election, but if none then to the Eligible
Participant’s Retirement Account if there is only one, or equally to the Eligible Participant’s Retirement Accounts if
the Eligible Participant has more than one Retirement Accounts, but if the Eligible Participant has no Retirement
Account then the amount subject to such
11

deferral election shall be allocated to a Retirement Account deemed to be elected by the Participant with a lump sum
form of payment, and such Retirement Account shall be one of the Participant’s permitted Retirement Accounts under
the Plan.
3.6 Irrevocability of Deferral Elections and Account Allocation Elections.
(a)

Except as otherwise provided herein, once made for a Plan Year, a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)
(1), 3.2(b)(1) and 3.2(b)(2), and the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not
be revoked, changed or modified after the applicable deferral election filing deadline specified in Sections 3.1(b)(1),
3.2(b)(1), and 3.2(b)(2), and a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c), and
the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or
modified after the date of each such deferral election as provided in Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c). A
deferral election for one Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if a
deferral is desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Participant.

(b)

In the event an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral election under
Section 3.1 will terminate as of the date of such Separation from Service (but will be effective with respect to the last
regular paycheck issued to such Eligible Officer), regardless of whether the Eligible Officer continues to receive
Compensation, or other remuneration, from any Employer or Related Affiliate thereafter. If an Eligible Officer has a
Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Officer) within the same Plan
Year, his or her deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall be automatically reinstated and shall remain in effect
for the remainder of such Plan Year.

(c)

In the event an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral elections, if
any, under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral
election. If an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an
Eligible Participant) within the same Plan Year or the same performance period, his or her deferral elections, if any,
under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral
elections.

(d)

In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account
of a Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under
Section 3.1 will terminate as of the next following January 31. In addition, in the event the Compensation of such
individual is reduced as a result of the change in status, his or her deferral election following such loss and through
the date of
12

termination of such election as provided in the preceding sentence will be pro rated based on his or her new level of
Compensation.
(e)

In the event an Eligible Officer receives Company-paid short term disability payments and the Compensation of such
individual is reduced as a result of the short term disability status, then following such reduction in Compensation his
or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will be pro rated based on his or her new level of
Compensation through the date of termination of such election.

(f)

In the event an Eligible Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant (other than on account of a Separation from
Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.2 will terminate for any
performance period beginning in the calendar year following the year of the loss of Eligible Participant status.

(g)

In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account
of Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.3
will remain in effect.

(h)

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event an Eligible Officer goes on an unpaid leave of absence,
his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall automatically cease when he or she
commences the unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that if he or she returns from the unpaid leave of absence
during the same Plan Year, his or her Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1 shall automatically resume
immediately upon return from the leave of absence and shall continue in effect for the balance of the Plan Year. An
Eligible Officer’s Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1, if any, shall remain in effect with respect to any
Compensation to which such election applies that is paid while on a leave of absence. An Eligible Participant’s
deferral election under Sections 3.2 or 3.3, if any, shall not be affected by his or her leave of absence.

3.7 Automatic Suspension of Deferral Elections.
(a)

In the event a Participant receives a distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan (or any other plan or successor plan
sponsored by Walmart or any Related Affiliate) on account of hardship, which distribution is made pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) and requires suspension of deferrals under other arrangements such as
this Plan, the Participant’s deferral elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, pursuant to which deferrals would
otherwise be made during the six (6)-month period following the date of the distribution from the Walmart 401(k)
Plan shall be cancelled.

(b)

In the event a Participant requests a distribution pursuant to Section 5.5 due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, or the
Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan in order to alleviate his or her Unforeseeable
13

Emergency, and the Committee or its delegate determines that the Participant’s Unforeseeable Emergency may be
relieved through the cessation of deferrals under the Plan, some or all the Participant’s deferral elections under
Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, for such Plan Year as determined by the Committee or its delegate, shall be cancelled
as soon as administratively practicable following such determination by the Committee or its delegate.
ARTICLE IV.
ACCOUNTS AND TIMING OF CREDITS TO ACCOUNTS
4.1 Nature of Accounts.
Each Participant’s Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under
this Plan. The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time
attributable to a Participant’s Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant’s rights hereunder are limited
to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart to pay the benefits
provided by the Plan.
4.2 Deferral Credits and Employer Matching Contribution Credits.
Deferral Credits and Employer Matching Contribution Credits will be credited to each Participant’s Account as follows:
(a)

Deferred Compensation will be credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account as soon as practicable after the date
such Compensation would have otherwise been paid in cash.

(b)

Deferred MIP Bonuses and Deferred Special Bonuses will be credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account as soon
as practicable after the date the bonus could have otherwise been paid in cash.

(c)

Employer Matching Contribution Credits for a Plan Year will be credited to the Participant’s Matching Account as of
the last day of the Plan Year.

A Participant’s Account, including earnings credited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant’s Plan
benefits have been paid in full.
4.3 Valuation of Accounts.
Each Participant’s Account will be valued daily as of each Valuation Date.
4.4 Credited Earnings.
(a)

Every Valuation Date during a Plan Year, a Participant’s Account will be credited with an equivalent of a daily rate
of simple interest based on the yield on United States Treasury securities (not indexed for inflation) with a constant
14

maturity of ten (10) years, as of the first business day of January preceding such Plan Year, plus two hundred seventy
(270) basis points. This rate shall be determined on the basis of Federal Reserve Statistical Release H-15 (or any
successor statistical release of the Federal Reserve) and, if there is no such statistical release, on the basis of such
other generally recognized source of information concerning the market for United States Treasury securities as the
Committee selects.
ARTICLE V.

In-Service Benefits. Each of a Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts will be distributed in a lump sum within
the 90-day period commencing on the Scheduled Pay Date applicable to such Scheduled In-Service Account. The
lump sum amount will be the value of the applicable Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Account as of the Scheduled
Pay Date.

(b)

Intervening Separation or Death. Notwithstanding the preceding, should an event occur prior to the Scheduled Pay
Date of any Scheduled In-Service Account that would trigger a distribution under Section 5.2 or 5.3 earlier than the
Scheduled Pay Date, such Scheduled In-Service Account or Accounts shall be distributed in accordance with Section
5.2 or 5.3, as applicable, and not in accordance with Section 5.1(a).

5.2 Separation Benefits.

of the last day of the month preceding the date of the distribution.

Installment Distributions.
(1)

If a Participant’s Retirement Account is to be distributed in the form of annual installments, the first such
installment shall be made within the 9015

day period commencing on the first January 31 following the Participant’s Separation from Service; provided,
however, that if such January 31 is earlier than the Participant’s Separation Pay Date, the first such installment
shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the Participant’s Separation Pay Date. Subsequent
installments shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on each successive January 31, until the
Participant’s benefits under such Account are distributed in full.
(2)

The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan
equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Retirement Account determined in accordance with Section
5.2(b)(2) (using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with
interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s Separation from
Service occurs.

5.3 Death Benefits.
(a)

General. In the event of the Participant’s death before incurring a Separation from Service or before commencement
of benefits, the Participant’s Account will be distributed in one of the forms provided in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c)
below in accordance with the Participant’s distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.4
below.
A Participant may elect only one form of payment under the Plan for all beneficiaries (at any level). If the Participant

shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the first January 31 coincident with or next following
the Participant’s death. Subsequent installments will be made during the 90-day period commencing on each
successive January 31, until the Participant’s benefits are distributed in full.
16

(2)

The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan
equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Account determined in accordance with Section 5.3(b)(2)
(using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with interest
calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s death occurs.

(d)

Death After Commencement of Installments. Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a Participant’s death
after installment payments to the Participant have commenced, such installment payments shall continue to be made
to the Participant’s designated beneficiary in the same manner as they were being distributed to the Participant prior
to his or her death, provided, however, that if the Participant’s distribution election applicable to Section 5.3(a) is a
lump sum payment, the Participant’s remaining installments will be distributed in lump sum to the Participant’s
designated beneficiary within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’s
death occurs.

(e)

Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the
form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries (which may be a trust or trusts) to
receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant’s death, and may
designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. A Participant may change such
designation from time to time and the last designation filed with the Committee in accordance with its procedures
prior to the Participant’s death will control. In the event no beneficiary is designated, or if all designated beneficiaries
predecease the Participant, payment shall be payable to the following “default” beneficiaries of the Participant in the
following order of priority: (1) the Participant’s surviving spouse known to the Committee, if any; (2) the
Participant’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the Participant’s living parents known to the
Committee in equal shares; (4) the Participant’s surviving siblings known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the
beneficiary’s estate for distribution in accordance with the terms of the beneficiary’s last will and testament or as a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine.

(f)

Death of Beneficiary. In the event a beneficiary dies before full payment of the Participant’s benefits under the Plan,
benefits that would have been paid to such beneficiary shall continue in the same form in equal shares to the
remaining beneficiaries at the same level (i.e., primary, contingent) and, if none, to the next level of beneficiaries. If
there are no beneficiaries at the next level, then any remaining benefits shall be paid to the following “default”
beneficiaries of the last living beneficiary in the following order of priority: (1) the beneficiary’s surviving spouse
known to the Committee, if any; (2) the beneficiary’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the
beneficiary’s surviving parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the beneficiary’s surviving
17

siblings known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the beneficiary’s estate for distribution in accordance with the
terms of the beneficiary’s last will and testament or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine.
5.4 Form of Distribution.
(a)

Forms Available. In the event of a Participant’s Separation from Service, or in the event of a Participant’s death if the
Participant dies prior to Separation from Service, distribution of his or her Retirement Account or, in the event of
death, his or her Account, may be made, at the Participant’s election per this Section 5.4, in one of the following
forms:
(1)

a lump sum;

(2)

subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years; or

(3)

solely with respect to distribution of the Participant’s Account in the event of death, partially a lump sum and,
subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years;

provided, however, that an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum
payment would be valued, the value of the Participant’s Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, Account, is at
least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Retirement Account, or in the event of death, Account,
is valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued
shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment.
(b)

Subsequent Elections. A Participant may change his or her distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with
respect to his or her Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, his or her Account, per this Section 5.4 at any time
by making a new election (referred to in this subsection as a “subsequent election”) on a form (which may be
electronic) approved by Executive Compensation and filed with Executive Compensation; provided, however, that
such subsequent election shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(1)

A subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which such
subsequent election is made;

(2)

Payment or initial payment pursuant to a subsequent election may not be made earlier than five (5) years from
the date such payment would have been made absent the subsequent election (but, for this purpose, installment
payments shall not commence until the first January 31 after such delay), unless the distribution is made on
account of the Participant’s death;
18

(3)

A subsequent election related to a payment must be made not less than twelve (12) months before the date the
payment is scheduled to be paid;

(4)

Payment of a Participant’s Retirement Account or, in the event of death, Account, pursuant to a subsequent
election must be completed by the last day of the Plan Year which contains the twentieth (20 th ) anniversary
of the Participant’s Separation Pay Date or the Participant’s death;

(5)

For purposes of this Section 5.4(b) and Code Section 409A, the entitlement to annual installment payments is
treated as the entitlement to a single payment.

If a Participant’s distribution election does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b), it will not be recognized
or given effect by the Committee. In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the
Participant’s most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b).
(c)

Filing of Election. A Participant’s distribution election applicable to the Participant’s Account in the event of the
Participant’s death prior to Separation from Service, and a Participant’s distribution election with respect to the
Participant’s Retirement Account or Retirement Accounts, and the Participant’s Scheduled Pay Date with respect to
the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts, must be filed with Executive Compensation on forms (which may
be electronic) prescribed by Executive Compensation.

5.5 Distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies.
(a)

In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee or its delegate, in its sole and absolute discretion and
upon written application of a Participant or, following the Participant’s death, the beneficiary to whom a Participant’s
benefits are then being paid, or will be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3, may direct immediate distribution of all or a
portion of the Participant’s Account (excluding the Participant’s Matching Account and related earnings if the
Participant is not fully vested in his or her Matching Account). The Committee will permit distribution on account of
an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, plus amounts
necessary to pay federal, state or local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the
distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant’s or beneficiary’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of
such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any
distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be made from the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts with
respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then from the
Participant’s Retirement Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan
19

Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then proratably from the remaining amount of the Participant’s
Scheduled In-Service Accounts and then proratably from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts.
(b)

5.6

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect
to any distribution under this Section 5.5 would not be permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m); such
payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction would not be permitted until the earliest date at which it
reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution would not be barred by application of Code Section
162(m); provided, however, that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date.

Distributions for Payment of Taxes.

Walmart’s Senior Vice President of Global Compensation, or any successor position, may accelerate and pay a portion of a
Participant’s Plan benefits in a lump sum equal to (a) the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed on Plan benefits and any
income tax withholding related to such amounts, as well as (b) any state, local or foreign tax obligations arising from participation in
the Plan (and related withholding under Code Section 3401) that apply to the amounts deferred under the Plan before such amount is
paid or made available to the Participant.
5.7

Reductions Arising from a Participant’s Gross Misconduct.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant’s Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not
engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an
ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee
determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions
hereunder to the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Matching Contribution Credits and credited Plan earnings
thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount
which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect
for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining installments shall be recalculated
to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per
annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the
Participant’s Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus and Deferred Special Bonus. Any payments received hereunder by a
Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross
Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or
during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts
hereunder, that the Participant
20

has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) shall repay to
Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7.
ARTICLE VI.

21

In the exercise of such allocated responsibilities, any action of the member to whom responsibilities are allocated
shall have the same force and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee.
The Committee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of such member. The member to whom responsibilities
have been allocated shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the discharge of the allocated
responsibilities.

authorize) and in the same manner to revoke any such delegation of responsibility. Any action of the delegate in the
exercise of such delegated responsibilities shall have the same force and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such
action had been taken by the Committee. The Committee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of any such
delegate. The delegate shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the discharge of the delegated
responsibilities.

23

meaning of Code Section 409A) of a relevant affiliate, partially terminate the Plan and distribute benefits to all Participants involved

WAL-MART STORES, INC.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These Share-Settled Performance Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any applicable special terms and conditions
for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the “Agreement”), contain the terms and conditions of the
Performance Units granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), a Delaware corporation, under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the “Plan”).
All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.
By signing or electronically accepting this Agreement, you hereby acknowledge, UNDERSTAND, agree to, and accept the
following:
1.
Grant of Performance Units . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the Performance Units, which
consist of the right to receive a number of Shares underlying the Performance Units set forth above (as further determined in
Paragraph 5 below), subject to certain vesting conditions during the Performance Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Performance Period will mean the period beginning on February 1 of the calendar year in which the Grant Date falls, and ending on
the Vesting Date as specified in the table at the top of this Agreement.
2.
Plan Governs . The Performance Units and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are
accepting the Performance Units, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and
acknowledging that the Performance Units and your participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan
and of this Agreement. You further agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and
interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising under the Plan, including whether, and the extent to which,
the Performance Measures and Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied.
1

3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the Performance Units or the Shares underlying Performance Units granted to
you pursuant to this Agreement.
4.

Stockholder Rights . Unless and until your Performance Units vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you:
A.

You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your Performance Units;

B.
You will not receive, or be entitled to receive, cash or any non-cash dividends on the Performance Units or the
Shares underlying the Performance Units; and
C.
You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the Performance Units. Upon
receipt of the Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and
will be provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart.
5.

Vesting of the Performance Units and Delivery of Shares .
A.
Incentive Years and Achievement Rates . The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and Performance
Measures applicable to your Performance Units. You will be informed of the performance criteria applicable to your
Performance Units in respect of each fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the "Employer")
during the Performance Period. Each such fiscal year during the Performance Period is referred to in this Agreement as an
“Incentive Year.” The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as set
forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The number of Performance Units that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that may be delivered to you shall
depend upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordance
with the Plan, for each Performance Measure during each Incentive Year of the Performance Period. With respect to each
applicable Performance Measure during an Incentive Year:
1.
“Threshold” performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established by
the Committee;
2.

“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and

3.
“Maximum” performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established by
the Committee.
An achievement rate is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of each Incentive
Year of the Performance Period. The achievement rate value applied to each weighted Performance Measure during an
Incentive Year is
2

expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for achieving at
least, but no less than, Threshold performance), 100% (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (for achieving
Maximum performance). A percentage of 0% shall be applied to a Performance Measure during an Incentive Year if
Threshold performance is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable achievement rates during an Incentive Year is
referred to as the “Incentive Year Achievement Rate.”
At the end of the Performance Period, the number of Performance Units that ultimately vest (the “Vested Performance
Units”) is determined by multiplying : (x) the average of all Incentive Year Achievement Rates during the Performance
Period and (y) the number of Performance Units granted by this Agreement.
In some instances, and as set forth more specifically in the summary table at the beginning of this Agreement, your
Performance Units may be subject to a Performance Period of less than three years.
1.
If your Performance Units are subject to a two-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested
Performance Units is determined by multiplying : (x) the average of the Incentive Year Achievement Rates during the
two-year Performance Period and (y) the number of Performance Units granted.
2.
If your Performance Units are subject to a one-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested
Performance Units shall be calculated as the lesser of :
a) the Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period multiplied by the number of
Performance Units granted; and
b)
one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the result of multiplying : (x) the three year average of the
Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period and the incentive achievement rates
for the two fiscal years immediately preceding the one-year Performance Period and (y) the number of
Performance Units granted.
B.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares
equal to the number of Vested Performance Units as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold to
satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as
administratively feasible, but in any event:
1.

within 150 days of the Vesting Date; or

2.

within 74 days of an Accelerated Vesting pursuant to Paragraph 8 below.

Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
C.
Mandatory Deferral. If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of any Shares in any year would, when
considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s
3

inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section
162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that
the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the
Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder. However, if you have made an
irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such
Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and
the Deferral Procedures.
1.
Covered Employee Plan Awards Subject to Shareholder Approval. To the extent you are a “covered
employee” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), your Plan Award and this Agreement are subject to, and
conditioned upon, shareholder approval of the material terms of the performance goals referred to in Paragraph 5.A
above.
D.
Elective Deferral of Shares. If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock
award to a future date in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be
advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
6.
Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Performance Units that would otherwise vest in whole or in part
on the Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.
your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
B. You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of
this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to
Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination
Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash
dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the
forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Performance Units
may be suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good
standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, your Performance Units may be immediately forfeited and you shall
have no further rights with respect to such Performance Units or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good
standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Performance Units will resume as provided in
Paragraph 5, and any Performance Units that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will
4

vest and the corresponding number of Shares will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74
days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8.
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your
Performance Units will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.A. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a
Vesting Date under the following circumstances:
A.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, you will become vested in a number of Shares equal to
the number of Shares that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous Status as an Associate
continued through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar months
during the Performance Period in which you had Continuous Status. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means,
unless provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease or
mental disorder that constitutes total disability under applicable laws and regulations, for which disability benefits have
actually been approved. It is your responsibility to notify the Walmart Global Equity team in the event you terminate due to
Disability.
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your death on or after ten years of service, you will become vested in a
number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous
Status continued through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A. If your Continuous Status is terminated by your death
before you have completed ten years of service, you will become vested in a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares
that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous Status as an Associate continued through the
Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar months during the Performance
Period (as shown above) in which you had Continuous Status.
In the event of accelerated vesting under this Paragraph 8, the vested Shares, as determined above, shall be delivered as soon
as administratively feasible after the later of the Vesting Date or the Committee’s determination of whether, and the extent to which,
the performance goals described in Paragraph 5.A have been satisfied.
9.

Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates .
A.
Permanent Transfers and Continuous Status . For the avoidance of doubt, a permanent transfer of Continuous
Status from Walmart, or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute a
termination of your Continuous Status.
B.

Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer .
1.
Incentive Year Prorated when Permanent Transfer Occurs . If you permanently transfer your Continuous
Status during the Performance Period, then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof)
and Performance Goals for the Incentive Year in which you transferred Continuous Status will be prorated and/or
adjusted to reflect the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if different,
the Affiliate that initially employed you (the “Initial
5

Employer”) and the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart or, if different,
the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the “Subsequent Employer”).
2.
Incentive Years Following Permanent Transfer . Once you permanently transfer your Continuous Status,
the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals applicable for the
Subsequent Employer shall be applied to your Performance Units for the subsequent Incentive Years remaining in
your Performance Period.
C.
Permanent Transfers to Affiliate or Position where Performance-Based Awards are Not Granted . If you
permanently transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are not
granted (other than where Paragraph 6.B applies), then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings
thereof) and Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units will be prorated and adjusted in the same method as
set forth in Paragraph 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above; provided however , that for the purposes of Paragraph 9.B.2., you will be
informed of the applicable performance criteria in respect of the subsequent Incentive Years in your Performance Period.
D.
Transfers to New Position with Same Employer . If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as defined
herein) but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings
thereof) and Performance Goals, then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and
Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units for the remainder of the Performance Period will be prorated and
adjusted using the same methodology as described in Paragraphs 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .
A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Performance Units and
acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart (or if different, the Employer), the ultimate
liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related
items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains your
responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that
Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items
in connection with any aspect of the Performance Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the
Performance Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and
(b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Performance Units or any aspect of the
Performance Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if
you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or
your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction.
6

C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all TaxRelated Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Vested Performance Units. In the event that such
withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting
consequences, by your acceptance of the Performance Units and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart and any
broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the
Vested Performance Units that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to
satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any
other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you
are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Performance Units, notwithstanding that a
number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole
Shares, an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or
regulatory body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may
be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share
equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by
the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if
you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11.
Performance Units Not Transferable . The Performance Units may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged
or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Performance Units and the issuance of the underlying
Shares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Share-Settled Performance Unit Notification and
Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of Performance Units also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set
forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules and regulations specific to your country.
Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will
apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal
or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Share7

Settled Performance Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of Performance Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future grants of Performance Units or other awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance Units, even if Performance
Units have been granted in the past;
C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of Performance Units or other awards, if any, will be at the sole
discretion of the Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with
or limit in any way the right of Walmart or, if different, the Employer to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor
confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, relate
exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your Performance Units;
F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, are
not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
I.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, are not
part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance,
resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or
retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;
J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units,
and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you
may provide as a director of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the Performance Units is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be
predicted with certainty;
8

L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Units resulting
from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in
breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any),
and in consideration of the grant of the Performance Units to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree (i)
never to institute any claim against Walmart or any Affiliate; (ii) waive your ability, if any, to bring such claim, and (iii)
release Walmart and all Affiliates from such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such
claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right
to receive and vest in the Performance Units under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no
longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of
service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the
Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this
Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Performance Units and the benefits
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance Units or any such benefits transferred to,
or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction
affecting the Shares underlying the Performance Units; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
Performance Units or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Performance Units or the subsequent sale
of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the
Performance Units acquired upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding
the decision to participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart
and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You
understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you,
9

including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number
or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all
Performance Units or any other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for
the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in
the future, which is assisting Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the
recipients of the Data may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may
have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and
addresses of any potential recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart,
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with
implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form,
for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of
Data as may be required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as
is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the
United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require
any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing
your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely
voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career with the
Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart
would not be able to grant Performance Units or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore,
you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information
on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human
resources representative.
16.

Other Provisions .
A.
Determinations regarding this Agreement (including, but not limited to, whether, and the extent to which, the
Performance Measures and Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied, and whether an event has
occurred resulting in the forfeiture of or accelerated vesting of a Performance Unit) shall be made by the Committee in its
sole and exclusive discretion and in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan, and all determinations of the Committee
shall be final and conclusive and binding on you and your successors and heirs.
B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force
and effect for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
10

C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are
similarly situated.
D.
Walmart reserves the right to amend any applicable Performance Measures (including any weightings thereof)
and/or Performance Goals for any Plan Award under this Agreement. In such a case, any amendments will be communicated
to you in writing (which may include a communication transmitted by electronic means, such as an e-mail communication or
a communication posted online for your review).
E.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.

F.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law
provisions.
G.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
H.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English
language version of such document will control.
I.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation
in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to
participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party
designated by Walmart.
J.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award and
the Shares underlying the Performance Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent Walmart determines it is
necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or
undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
K.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by
you or any other Associate.
L.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability
to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the
laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider
trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations and any
applicable Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
11

M.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds
arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or
legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts,
assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account,
exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
N.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver
any Shares issuable upon vesting of the Performance Units prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the
Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any
approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or
approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no
obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or
clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good

SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC APPENDIX
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Share-Settled
Performance Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions (the “T&C’s”).
Terms and Conditions . This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance Units granted to you
under the Plan if you work and/or reside in one of the countries listed below.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, Walmart shall, in its
discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you .
Notifications . This Appendix also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be
aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in
effect in the respective countries as of November 2015. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Walmart
strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the
consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the Performance Units
vest or you receive a cash payout under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and Walmart is not
in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the
relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications
contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
ARGENTINA
Notifications
Securities Law Information . Neither the Performance Units nor any Shares subject to the Performance Units are publicly offered or
listed on any stock exchange in Argentina. The offer is private and not subject to the supervision of any Argentine governmental
authority.
1

Exchange Control Information . If you transfer proceeds from the sale of any Shares acquired under the Plan into Argentina within
10 days of sale ( i.e. , if the proceeds have not been held in a U.S. bank or brokerage account for at least 10 days prior to transfer),
you must deposit 30% of the sale proceeds into a non-interest bearing account in Argentina for 365 days. If you have satisfied the 10
day holding obligation, the Argentine bank handling the transaction may request certain documentation in connection with your
request to transfer sale proceeds into Argentina, including evidence of the sale and proof of the source of funds used to purchase the
Shares. If the bank determines that the 10-day rule or any other rule or regulation promulgated by the Argentine Central Bank has
not been satisfied, it will require that 30% of the transfer amount be placed in a non-interest bearing dollar denominated mandatory
deposit account for a holding period of 365 days. You understand that you must comply with any and all Argentine currency
exchange restrictions, approvals and reporting requirements in connection with the Performance Units and your participation in the
Plan.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . If you are an Argentine tax resident, you must report any Shares acquired under the
Plan and held by you on December 31st of each year on your annual tax return for that year.

Termination of Continuous Status . This provision replaces Paragraph 14(M) of the T&C’s:
In the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid for any reason, including for
breaching either applicable employment laws or your employment agreement, if any), your right to receive and vest in the
Performance Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as the earlier of (i) the date on which your Continuous Status is
terminated, or (ii) the date you no longer actively provide service to Walmart or any Affiliate due to the termination of your
Continuous Status, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law. Walmart shall
have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you
may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).
Vesting and Delivery of Shares . This provision supplements Paragraph 5 of the T&C's:
Instead of delivering Shares upon vesting of your Performance Units to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C's, Walmart or
Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle your Vested Performance Units in
cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you hereby acknowledge
and agree that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in respect of the Vested
Performance Units to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so
purchased on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C’s.
The Following Provisions Apply to Associates and Non-Management Directors Resident in Quebec:
Language Consent . The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Agreement, as well as all documents, notices, and
legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
Consentement relatif à la langue utilisée . Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette convention, ainsi que
de tous documents, avis et procédures judiciaires, exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement à, la
présente convention.
Data Privacy . This provision supplements Paragraph 15 of the T&C’s:
You hereby authorize Walmart, any Affiliate and their representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all
personnel, professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Plan. You further authorize Walmart, any Affiliate
and any stock plan service provider that may be selected by Walmart to assist with the Plan to disclose and discuss the Plan with
their respective advisors. You further authorize Walmart or an Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in
your employee file.
Notifications
Securities Law Information . You are permitted to sell the Shares acquired through the Plan through the designated broker, if any,
provided the resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes
3

place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed ( i.e. , the NYSE).
Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information . Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive
Shares ( e.g. , Performance Units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported
annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds
C$100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Performance Units likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000
cost threshold is exceeded because of other specified foreign property that you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally
is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of
acquisition, but if you own other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.
CHILE
Terms and Conditions
Labor Law Acknowledgement . The Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value
of same, shall not be considered as part of the your remuneration for purposes of determining the calculation base of future
indemnities, whether statutory or contractual, for years of service (severance) or in lieu of prior notice, pursuant to Article 172 of the
Chilean Labor Code.
Notifications
Securities Law Information . This grant of Performance Units constitutes a private offering of securities in Chile effective as of the
Grant Date. This offer of Performance Units is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Superintendence of Securities
and Insurance (“SVS”). The offer refers to securities not registered at the securities registry or at the foreign securities registry of the
SVS, and, therefore, such securities are not subject to oversight of the SVS. Given that the RSUs are not registered in Chile,
Walmart is not required to provide public information about the Performance Units or the Shares in Chile. Unless the Performance
Units and/or the Shares are registered with the SVS, a public offering of such securities cannot be made in Chile.
Esta Oferta de Performance Units (“Unidades”) constituye una oferta privada de valores en Chile y se inicia en la Fecha de la
Oferta. Esta oferta de Unidades se acoge a las disposiciones de la Norma de Carácter General Nº 336 (“NCG 336”) de la
Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros de Chile (“SVS”). Esta oferta versa sobre valores no inscritos en el Registro de Valores o
en el Registro de Valores Extranjeros que lleva la SVS, por lo que tales valores no están sujetos a la fiscalización de ésta. Por
tratarse de valores no inscritos en Chile no existe la obligación por parte de Walmart de entregar en Chile información pública
respecto de los mismos. Estos valores no podrán ser objeto de oferta pública en Chile mientras no sean inscritos en el Registro de
Valores correspondiente.
Exchange Control Information . You are not required to repatriate any funds you receive with respect to the Performance Units ( e.g.
, any proceeds from the sale of any Shares issued upon vesting of the Performance Units) to Chile. However, if you decide to
repatriate such funds, you
4

acknowledge that you will be required to effect such repatriation through the Formal Exchange Market ( i.e. , a commercial bank or
registered foreign exchange office) if the amount of the funds repatriated exceeds US$10,000. Further, if the value of your aggregate
investments held outside of Chile exceeds US$5,000,000 at any time in a calendar year, you must report the status of such
investments to the Central Bank of Chile.
You will also be required to provide certain information to the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (“CIRS”) regarding the results of
investments held abroad and the taxes you have paid abroad (if you will be seeking a credit against Chilean income tax owed). This
information must be submitted on an electronic sworn statement, Formulario 1851 (for investments held abroad) and Formulario
1853 (for taxes paid abroad) before March 15 of each year. The formularios may be found at the CIRS website at www.sii.cl.

advisor regarding any obligations that you may have in connection with the Performance Units.

If payment or withholding of the income tax is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the tax year in which the income tax
liability arises or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax Act (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the

SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These Share-Settled Performance Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any applicable special terms and conditions
for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the “Agreement”), contain the terms and conditions of the
Performance Units granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), a Delaware corporation, under the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the “Plan”).
All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.
BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING:
1.
Grant of Performance Units . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the Performance Units, which
consist of the right to receive a number of Shares underlying the Performance Units set forth above (as further determined in
Paragraph 5 below), subject to certain vesting conditions during the Performance Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Performance Period will mean the period beginning on February 1 of the calendar year in which the Grant Date falls, and ending on
the Vesting Date as specified in the table at the top of this Agreement.
2.
Plan Governs . The Performance Units and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are
accepting the Performance Units, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and
acknowledging that the Performance Units and your participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan
and of this Agreement. You further agree to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions and
1

interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising under the Plan, including whether, and the extent to which,
the Performance Measures and Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied.
3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the Performance Units or the Shares underlying Performance Units granted to
you pursuant to this Agreement.
4.

Stockholder Rights . Unless and until your Performance Units vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you:
A.

You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your Performance Units;

B.
You will not receive, or be entitled to receive, cash or any non-cash dividends on the Performance Units or the
Shares underlying the Performance Units; and
C.
You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the Performance Units. Upon
receipt of the Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and
will be provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart.
5.

Vesting of the Performance Units and Delivery of Shares .
A.
Incentive Years and Achievement Rates . The Committee establishes the Performance Goals and Performance
Measures applicable to your Performance Units. You will be informed of the performance criteria applicable to your
Performance Units in respect of each fiscal year of Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you (the "Employer")
during the Performance Period. Each such fiscal year during the Performance Period is referred to in this Agreement as an
“Incentive Year.” The Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals as set
forth in such separate writing are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
The number of Performance Units that ultimately may vest and, accordingly, the Shares that may be delivered to you shall
depend upon the degree to which the Performance Goals have been achieved, as determined by the Committee in accordance
with the Plan, for each Performance Measure during each Incentive Year of the Performance Period. With respect to each
applicable Performance Measure during an Incentive Year:
1.
“Threshold” performance means the achievement of the lowest possible Performance Goal established by the
Committee;
2.

“Target” performance means the achievement of the Performance Goal established by the Committee; and

3.
“Maximum” performance means the highest possible achievement of the Performance Goal established by the
Committee.
An achievement rate is determined for each Performance Measure applicable to your Plan Award in respect of each Incentive
Year of the Performance Period. The achievement rate value applied to each weighted Performance Measure during an
Incentive Year is
2

expressed as a percentage and may range from 0% (for achieving less than Threshold Performance), 50% (for achieving at
least, but no less than, Threshold performance), 100% (for achieving Target performance), or up to 150% (for achieving
Maximum performance). A percentage of 0% shall be applied to a Performance Measure during an Incentive Year if
Threshold performance is not achieved. The weighted average of all applicable achievement rates during an Incentive Year is
referred to as the “Incentive Year Achievement Rate.”
At the end of the Performance Period, the number of Performance Units that ultimately vest (the “Vested Performance
Units”) is determined by multiplying : (x) the average of all Incentive Year Achievement Rates during the Performance
Period and (y) the number of Performance Units granted by this Agreement.
In some instances, and as set forth more specifically in the summary table at the beginning of this Agreement, your
Performance Units may be subject to a Performance Period of less than three years.
1.
If your Performance Units are subject to a two-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested Performance
Units is determined by multiplying : (x) the average of the Incentive Year Achievement Rates during the two-year
Performance Period and (y) the number of Performance Units granted.
2.
If your Performance Units are subject to a one-year Performance Period, then the number of Vested Performance
Units shall be calculated as the lesser of :
a) the Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period multiplied by the number of
Performance Units granted; and
b)
one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the result of multiplying : (x) the three year average of the
Incentive Year Achievement Rate for the one-year Performance Period and the incentive achievement rates
for the two fiscal years immediately preceding the one-year Performance Period and (y) the number of
Performance Units granted.
B.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Plan Award, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares
equal to the number of Vested Performance Units as calculated in Paragraph 5.A. above less any Shares withheld or sold to
satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as
administratively feasible, but in any event:
1. within 150 days of the Vesting Date; or
2. within 74 days of an Accelerated Vesting pursuant to Paragraph 8 below.
Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
Furthermore, Walmart or Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may
settle your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a
3

combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you hereby acknowledge and agree
that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in respect of the vested RSUs
to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so purchased
on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in this Paragraph 5.
C.
Mandatory Deferral . If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of any Shares in any year would, when
considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the
limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until
the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m)
(the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A and the
regulations thereunder. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First
Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your
Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the Deferral Procedures.
1.
Covered Employee Plan Awards Subject to Shareholder Approval . To the extent you are a “covered employee”
within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), your Plan Award and this Agreement are subject to, and conditioned upon,
shareholder approval of the material terms of the performance goals referred to in Paragraph 5.A above.
D.
Elective Deferral of Shares . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock
award to a future date in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be
advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
6.
Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Performance Units that would otherwise vest in whole or in part
on the Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.
Your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
B.
You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of
this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to
Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination
Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash
dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the
forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.

4

7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Performance Units may be
suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at
the end of the administrative suspension period, your Performance Units may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further
rights with respect to such Performance Units or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the
end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Performance Units will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and
any Performance Units that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the corresponding number
of Shares will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the
administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8.
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your
Performance Units will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.A. above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a
Vesting Date under the following circumstances:
A.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, you will become vested in a number of Shares equal to
the number of Shares that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous Status as an Associate
continued through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar months
during the Performance Period in which you had Continuous Status. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means,
unless provided otherwise by a policy of Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease or
mental disorder that constitutes total disability under applicable laws and regulations, for which disability benefits have
actually been approved. It is your responsibility to notify the Walmart Global Equity team in the event you terminate due to
Disability.
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your death on or after ten years of service, you will become vested in a
number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous
Status continued through the Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A. If your Continuous Status is terminated by your death
before you have completed ten years of service, you will become vested in a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares
that would have become vested under Paragraph 5.A had your Continuous Status as an Associate continued through the
Vesting Date described in Paragraph 5.A, prorated based upon the number of full calendar months during the Performance
Period (as shown above) in which you had Continuous Status.
In the event of accelerated vesting under this Paragraph 8, the vested Shares, as determined above, shall be delivered as soon
as administratively feasible after the later of the Vesting Date or the Committee’s determination of whether, and the extent to which,
the performance goals described in Paragraph 5.A have been satisfied.
9.

Permanent Transfers Between Walmart and Walmart Affiliates .
A.
Permanent Transfers and Continuous Status . For the avoidance of doubt, a permanent transfer of Continuous
Status from Walmart, or the Employer (if different), to another Affiliate or from an Affiliate to Walmart does not constitute a
termination of your Continuous Status.

5

B.

Applicable Performance Measures and Goals Upon Permanent Transfer .
1.
Incentive Year Prorated when Permanent Transfer Occurs . If you permanently transfer your Continuous Status
during the Performance Period, then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and
Performance Goals for the Incentive Year in which you transferred Continuous Status will be prorated and/or adjusted to
reflect the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided service to Walmart, or, if different, the Affiliate
that initially employed you (the “Initial Employer”) and the proportion of the Incentive Year during which you provided
service to Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate to which you permanently transferred (the “Subsequent Employer”).
2.
Incentive Years Following Permanent Transfer . Once you permanently transfer your Continuous Status, the
Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and Performance Goals applicable for the
Subsequent Employer shall be applied to your Performance Units for the subsequent Incentive Years remaining in your
Performance Period.

C.
Permanent Transfers to Affiliate or Position where Performance-Based Awards are Not Granted . If you
permanently transfer your Continuous Status to an Affiliate or into a position where performance-based Plan Awards are not
granted (other than where Paragraph 6.B applies), then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings
thereof) and Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units will be prorated and adjusted in the same method as
set forth in Paragraph 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above; provided however , that for the purposes of Paragraph 9.B.2., you will be
informed of the applicable performance criteria in respect of the subsequent Incentive Years in your Performance Period.
D.
Transfers to New Position with Same Employer . If you transfer to a position with the same Employer (as defined
herein) but your new position is subject to different applicable Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings
thereof) and Performance Goals, then the Performance Measures (including any applicable weightings thereof) and
Performance Goals applicable to your Performance Units for the remainder of the Performance Period will be prorated and
adjusted using the same methodology as described in Paragraphs 9.B.1. and 9.B.2. above.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .
A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Performance Units and
acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart (or if different, the Employer), the ultimate
liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related
items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”) is and remains your
responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge that
Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items
in connection with any aspect of the Performance Units, including, but not limited to, the
6

grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and
the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Performance
Units or any aspect of the Performance Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any
particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that
Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for TaxRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all TaxRelated Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Vested Performance Units. In the event that such
withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting
consequences, by your acceptance of the Performance Units and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart and any
broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the
Vested Performance Units that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to
satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any
other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you
are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Performance Units, notwithstanding that a
number of the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole
Shares, an excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or
regulatory body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may
be entitled to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share
equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by
the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if
you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11.
Performance Units Not Transferable . The Performance Units may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged
or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Performance Units and the issuance of the underlying
Shares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
7

12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Share-Settled Performance Unit Notification and
Terms and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of Performance Units also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set
forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules and regulations specific to your country.
Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will
apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal
or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Share-Settled Performance Unit Notification and
Terms and Conditions and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of Performance Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to
receive future grants of Performance Units or other awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance Units, even if Performance
Units have been granted in the past;
C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of Performance Units or other awards, if any, will be at the sole
discretion of the Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with
or limit in any way the right of Walmart or, if different, the Employer to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor
confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, relate
exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your Performance Units;
F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, are
not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
I.
the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value of same, are not
part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance,
resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or
retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;
8

J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units,
and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you
may provide as a director of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the Performance Units is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be
predicted with certainty;
L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance Units resulting
from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in
breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any),
and in consideration of the grant of the Performance Units to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree (i)
never to institute any claim against Walmart or any Affiliate; (ii) waive your ability, if any, to bring such claim, and (iii)
release Walmart and all Affiliates from such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such
claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right
to receive and vest in the Performance Units under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no
longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of
service would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the
Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this
Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Performance Units and the benefits
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance Units or any such benefits transferred to,
or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction
affecting the Shares underlying the Performance Units; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
Performance Units or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Performance Units or the subsequent sale
of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the
Performance Units acquired
9

upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to participate in
the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart
and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You
understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your
name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number or other identification number,
salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all Performance Units or any
other awards granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of
implementing, administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith and its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is assisting
Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be
located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws
and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential
recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering
and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be
required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to
implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you
may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary
amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human
resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career with the Employer will not be adversely
affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant
Performance Units or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you understand that
refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences
of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.
16.

Other Provisions .
A.
Determinations regarding this Agreement (including, but not limited to, whether, and the extent to which, the
Performance Measures and Performance Goals referred to in Paragraph 5 have been satisfied, and whether an event has
occurred resulting in the forfeiture of or accelerated vesting of a Performance Unit) shall be made by the Committee in its
sole and exclusive discretion and in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan, and all determinations of the Committee
shall be final and conclusive and binding on you and your successors and heirs.
10

B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force
and effect for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are
similarly situated.
D.
Walmart reserves the right to amend any applicable Performance Measures (including any weightings thereof)
and/or Performance Goals for any Plan Award under this Agreement. In such a case, any amendments will be communicated
to you in writing (which may include a communication transmitted by electronic means, such as an e-mail communication or
a communication posted online for your review).
E.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.

F.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law
provisions.
G.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
H.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English
language version of such document will control.
I.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation
in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to
participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party
designated by Walmart.
J.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award and
the Shares underlying the Performance Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent Walmart determines it is
necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or
undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
K.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by
you or any other Associate.
L.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your ability
to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such
11

times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the laws in your country). The restrictions applicable
under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your
responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations and any applicable Walmart insider trading policy, and
are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds
arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or
legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts,
assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account,
exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
N.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver
any Shares issuable upon vesting of the Performance Units prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the
Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any
approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or
approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no
obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or
clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good
faith actions, place legend restrictions upon Shares underlying your Vested Performance Units and issue “stop transfer”
instructions requiring compliance with applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan.
Further, you agree that Walmart shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to
the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares.
12

WAL-MART STORES, INC.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
SHARE-SETTLED PERFORMANCE UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC APPENDIX
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Share-Settled
Performance Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions (the “T&C’s”).
Terms and Conditions . This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Performance Units granted to you
under the Plan if you work and/or reside in one of the countries listed below.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, Walmart shall, in its
discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you .
Notifications . This Appendix also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be
aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in
effect in the respective countries as of November 2015. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Walmart
strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the
consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the Performance Units
vest or you receive a cash payout under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and Walmart is not
in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the
relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications
contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
ARGENTINA
Notifications
Securities Law Information . Neither the Performance Units nor any Shares subject to the Performance Units are publicly offered or
listed on any stock exchange in Argentina. The offer is private and not subject to the supervision of any Argentine governmental
authority.
1

Exchange Control Information . If you transfer proceeds from the sale of any Shares acquired under the Plan into Argentina within
10 days of sale ( i.e. , if the proceeds have not been held in a U.S. bank or brokerage account for at least 10 days prior to transfer),
you must deposit 30% of the sale proceeds into a non-interest bearing account in Argentina for 365 days. If you have satisfied the 10
day holding obligation, the Argentine bank handling the transaction may request certain documentation in connection with your
request to transfer sale proceeds into Argentina, including evidence of the sale and proof of the source of funds used to purchase the
Shares. If the bank determines that the 10-day rule or any other rule or regulation promulgated by the Argentine Central Bank has
not been satisfied, it will require that 30% of the transfer amount be placed in a non-interest bearing dollar denominated mandatory
deposit account for a holding period of 365 days. You understand that you must comply with any and all Argentine currency
exchange restrictions, approvals and reporting requirements in connection with the Performance Units and your participation in the
Plan.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . If you are an Argentine tax resident, you must report any Shares acquired under the
Plan and held by you on December 31st of each year on your annual tax return for that year.
BRAZIL
Terms and Conditions
Compliance with the Law . By accepting the Performance Units, you acknowledge your agreement to comply with applicable
Brazilian laws and to pay any and all applicable Tax-Related Items associated with the Performance Units and the sale of any Shares
acquired under the Plan.
Labor Law Acknowledgement . By accepting the Performance Units, you agree that you are (i) making an investment decision, (ii)
the Shares will be issued to you only if the vesting conditions are met, and (iii) the value of the underlying Shares is not fixed and
may increase or decrease in value over the vesting period without compensation to you.
Notifications
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . If you hold assets and rights outside Brazil with an aggregate value exceeding
US$100,000, you will be required to prepare and submit to the Central Bank of Brazil an annual declaration of such assets and
rights, including: (i) bank deposits; (ii) loans; (iii) financing transactions; (iv) leases; (v) direct investments; (vi) portfolio
investments, including Shares acquired under the Plan; (vii) financial derivatives investments; and (viii) other investments, including
real estate and other assets. Please note that foreign individuals holding Brazilian visas are considered Brazilian residents for
purposes of this reporting requirement and must declare at least the assets held abroad that were acquired subsequent to the date of
admittance as a resident of Brazil. Individuals holding assets and rights outside Brazil valued at less than US$100,000 are not
required to submit a declaration. Please note that the US$100,000 threshold may be changed annually.
CANADA
Terms and Conditions
2

Termination of Continuous Status . This provision replaces Paragraph 14(M) of the T&C’s:
In the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid for any reason, including for
breaching either applicable employment laws or your employment agreement, if any), your right to receive and vest in the
Performance Units under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as the earlier of (i) the date on which your Continuous Status is
terminated, or (ii) the date you no longer actively provide service to Walmart or any Affiliate due to the termination of your
Continuous Status, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice required under local law. Walmart shall
have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you
may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).
Vesting and Delivery of Shares . This provision supplements Paragraph 5 of the T&C's:
Instead of delivering Shares upon vesting of your Performance Units to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C's, Walmart or
Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle your Vested Performance Units in
cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you hereby acknowledge
and agree that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in respect of the Vested
Performance Units to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so
purchased on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C’s.
The Following Provisions Apply to Associates and Non-Management Directors Resident in Quebec:
Language Consent . The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Agreement, as well as all documents, notices, and
legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
Consentement relatif à la langue utilisée . Les parties reconnaissent avoir exigé la rédaction en anglais de cette convention, ainsi que
de tous documents, avis et procédures judiciaires, exécutés, donnés ou intentés en vertu de, ou liés directement ou indirectement à, la
présente convention.
Data Privacy . This provision supplements Paragraph 15 of the T&C’s:
You hereby authorize Walmart, any Affiliate and their representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all
personnel, professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Plan. You further authorize Walmart, any Affiliate
and any stock plan service provider that may be selected by Walmart to assist with the Plan to disclose and discuss the Plan with
their respective advisors. You further authorize Walmart or an Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in
your employee file.
Notifications
Securities Law Information . You are permitted to sell the Shares acquired through the Plan through the designated broker, if any,
provided the resale of Shares acquired under the Plan takes
3

place outside of Canada through the facilities of a stock exchange on which the Shares are listed ( i.e. , the NYSE).
Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information . Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive
Shares ( e.g. , Performance Units) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported
annually on a Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of your specified foreign property exceeds
C$100,000 at any time during the year. Thus, Performance Units likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000
cost threshold is exceeded because of other specified foreign property that you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally
is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of
acquisition, but if you own other Shares (acquired separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.
CHILE
Terms and Conditions
Labor Law Acknowledgement . The Performance Units and the Shares underlying the Performance Units, and the income and value
of same, shall not be considered as part of the your remuneration for purposes of determining the calculation base of future

Taxes and Tax Withholding . This section supplements Paragraph 10 of the T&C’s:
If payment or withholding of the income tax is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the tax year in which the income tax
liability arises or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax Act (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the
“Due Date”), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by you to Walmart or an Affiliate, effective on

(“HMRC”), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and Walmart or an Affiliate may recover it at any time thereafter by the
means referred to in Paragraph 10 of the T&C’s. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of Walmart
(within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), you shall not be eligible for a
loan from Walmart or an Affiliate to cover the income tax. In the event that you are a director or an executive officer and the income
tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you
on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions may be payable. You will be responsible for reporting and
paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime and for reimbursing
Walmart or an Affiliate, as applicable, for the value of any national insurance contributions due on this additional benefit, which

Vesting . Your Restricted Stock will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture Condition
described below:
Percentage of
Restricted Stock Vesting

Vesting Date

B.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Restricted Stock, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled
to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of vested Restricted Stock, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax
withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively
feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date. Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name
with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart. You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such designated
broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
6. Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Shares underlying your Restricted Stock that would otherwise vest in
whole or in part on a Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
a. your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in Paragraph
8 below); or
b. You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
2

Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this
Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to
Compete, in a form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination
Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash
dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the
forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Restricted Stock may be
suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at
the end of the administrative suspension period, your Restricted Stock may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further
rights with respect to such Restricted Stock (including any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Restricted Stock for
which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in
good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Restriced Stock will resume as provided in
Paragraph 5, and any Restricted Stock that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the number
of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock will be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event
within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this
Paragraph 7.
8. Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your Restricted Stock
will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.A above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, under
the following circumstances:
A.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, your Restricted Stock that would have become vested
on a Vesting Date no more than 90 days after your Continuous Status is so terminated will become vested on the date your
Continuous Status is so terminated. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means, unless provided otherwise by a policy of
Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease or mental disorder that constitutes total disability under
applicable laws and regulations, for which disability benefits have actually been approved; or
B. If your Continuous Status is terminated by reason of your death on or after ten years of service or on or after the third
anniversary of the Grant Date, then your unvested Restricted Stock shall immediately become fully vested.
For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date on
which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of Disability. It is your responsibility to
notify the Walmart Global Equity team in the event you terminate due to Disability.

9.

Deferral of Restricted Stock.

A.
Mandatory Deferral . If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of Restricted
Stock in any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of such
Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then Walmart shall defer the delivery of
such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related deduction will not be limited under Section
162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under the Plan and Code Section 409A. However,
if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not
deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election
and the Deferral Procedures.
B.
Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your Restricted
Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto, you will be advised
as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such deferral election.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .

A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Restricted Stock and
acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. Please see Paragraph 10.F
regarding Section 83(b) elections.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you
(the “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on
account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is and
remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge
that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in
connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted
Stock, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to
and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your
liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer, as applicable) may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Restricted Stock. In the event that such withholding in
Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your acceptance
of the Restricted Stock and this
4

Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a
whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to
generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy
the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from
your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have
been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are
withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess amount of tax
is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event that any
excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any overwithheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the
means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply
with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
F.
By accepting this Agreement, you agree not to make a Code Section 83(b) election with respect to this award of
Restricted Stock.
11.
Restricted Stock Not Transferable . The Restricted Stock may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Restricted Stock and the issuance of the underlying Shares.
Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Restricted Stock Award Notification of Award and
Terms and Conditions of Award to the contrary, the grant of Restricted Stock also shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions as set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific
to your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such
country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Restricted Stock Award
Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
5

A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

all decisions with respect to future grants of Restricted Stock or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion
of the Committee;

the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, relate

any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, and the income and value of same, are not
intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;

of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare
benefits or similar payments;
J.

director of any Affiliate;
K.
with certainty;

the future value of the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted

L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock and the
Shares underlying the Restricted Stock resulting from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever,
whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of
your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock to which you are otherwise not
entitled, you irrevocably agree (i) never to institute any claim against
6

Walmart or any Affiliate; (ii) waive your ability, if any, to bring such claim, and (iii) release Walmart and all Affiliates from such
claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the
Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary
to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right to
receive and vest in the Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively
providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law (e.g., your period of service would not include any
contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction
where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to
determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered
to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Restricted Stock and the benefits
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Restricted Stock, the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock,
or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any
corporate transaction affecting the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
Restricted Stock or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Stock or the subsequent sale of any Shares
acquired upon settlement.

participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.

Walmart in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be
located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws
and protections than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential
recipients of Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering
and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of
implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be
required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to
implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you
may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary
amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human
resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do
not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career with the Employer will not be adversely
affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart would not be able to grant RSUs or other
Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your
consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.

binding on you and your successors and heirs.

I.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and
the Shares underlying the Restricted Stock, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
J.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by you or any
other Associate.
K.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your
ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the
laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider trading
policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and any applicable
Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
L.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds arising
from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity

M.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any
Shares issuable upon vesting of the Restricted Stock prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under
any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of

approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or
approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation
to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any
governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend
restrictions upon Shares underlying your vested Restricted Stock and issue “stop transfer” instructions requiring compliance with
applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart shall have
unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or
other laws applicable to issuance of Shares.

These Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award, including any

All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined

BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING:
1. Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the right to receive the
number of Shares set forth above on the Vesting Date as further set forth in Paragraph 5 below, subject to certain vesting conditions.
Before the Shares are vested and delivered to you, they are referred to in this Agreement as “Performance-Based Restricted Stock.”
2. Plan Governs . The Performance-Based Restricted Stock and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
You are accepting the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering
the Plan, and acknowledging that the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and your participation in the Plan are subject to all the

3. Payment . You are not required to pay for the Performance-Based Restricted Stock or the Shares underlying the Resticted Stock
granted to you pursuant to this Agreement.
1

4. Stockholder Rights . Your Performance-Based Restricted Stock will be held for you by Walmart until the applicable delivery
date described in Paragraph 5. You shall have all the rights of a stockholder of Shares of Performance-Based Restricted Stock that
vest. With respect to your unvested Performance-Based Restricted Stock:
A.
you shall have the right to vote the Shares underlying your Performance-Based Restricted Stock on any matter as
to which Shares have voting rights at any meeting of shareholders of Walmart;
B.
you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting restrictions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes) all cash
dividends paid with respect to such Shares underlying your Performance-Based Restricted Stock; and
C.
any non-cash dividends and other non-cash proceeds of such Shares underlying your Performance-Based
Restricted Stock, including stock dividends and any other securities issued or distributed in respect of such Shares underlying your
Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting and forfeiture conditions as are applicable to your
Performance-Based Restricted Stock, and the term “Performance-Based Restricted Stock,” as used in this Agreement, shall also
include any related stock dividends and other securities issued or distributed in respect of such Shares underlying your PerformanceBased Restricted Stock.
5.

Vesting of Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Delivery of Shares .

A.
Vesting . Your Performance-Based Restricted Stock will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a
Forfeiture Condition described below:
Percentage of
Performance-Based
Restricted Stock Vesting

Vesting Date

B.
Delivery of Shares . Upon the vesting of your Performance-Based Restricted Stock, subject to Paragraph 9 below,
you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to the number of vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock, less any
Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10 below. The Shares shall be delivered to
you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date. Such Shares will be deposited into an
account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart. You will be responsible for all fees imposed by such
designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.

2

6.

Forfeiture Conditions .

A.
Satisfaction of Performance Goals . Within 90 days of the Grant Date, the Committee will adopt one or more
performance goals which must be met or exceeded during one or more performance periods as a condition precedent to the vesting
of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock. Those performance goals will be communicated to you in a separate writing, which will
be incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Unless the Company meets or exceeds the applicable performance goal or goals
for the applicable performance period or periods, as certified by the Committee in accordance with the Plan, your PerformanceBased Restricted Stock award that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on any Vesting Date will not vest and shall be
immediately forfeited as of the last day of such performance period.
B.
Other Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the Shares underlying your Performance-Based
Restricted Stock that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on a Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if,
prior to the Vesting Date:
i.
your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
ii.
You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a
form to be provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A, 6.B.i, and 6.B.ii above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for
purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such
Performance-Based Restricted Stock (including any cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Performance-Based
Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your Performance-Based
Restricted Stock may be suspended as of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an
Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension period, your Performance-Based Restricted Stock may be
immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such Performance-Based Restricted Stock (including any
cash dividends and non-cash proceeds related to the Performance-Based Restricted Stock for which the record date occurs on or after
the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the
administrative suspension period, then the vesting of your Restriced Stock will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any
Performance-Based Restricted Stock that would have vested while you were on administrative suspension will vest and the number
of Shares corresponding to the vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock will be delivered to you as soon as administratively
feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be considered the Vesting
Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.

3

8.
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your
Performance-Based Restricted Stock will vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5.A above, and such earlier vesting date shall also
be considered a Vesting Date, under the following circumstances:
A.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, your Performance-Based Restricted Stock that would
have become vested on a Vesting Date no more than 90 days after your Continuous Status is so terminated will become vested on
the date your Continuous Status is so terminated. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means, unless provided otherwise
by a policy of Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease or mental disorder that constitutes total
disability under applicable laws and regulations, for which disability benefits have actually been approved; or
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by reason of your death on or after ten years of service or on or after the
third anniversary of the Grant Date, then your unvested Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall immediately become fully vested.
For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date on
which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of Disability. It is your responsibility to
notify the Walmart Global Equity team in the event you terminate due to Disability.
9.

Deferral of Performance-Based Restricted Stock.

A.
Mandatory Deferral . If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of
Performance-Based Restricted Stock in any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s
inability to deduct the value of such Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Code Section 162(m), then
Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related
deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the Deferral Procedures under
the Plan and Code Section 409A. However, if you have made an irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the
First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your
Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and the Deferral Procedures.
B.
Elective Deferral of Performance-Based Restricted Stock . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares
underlying your Performance-Based Restricted Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 7.8 of the Plan and rules and
procedures relating thereto, you will be advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures
applicable to such deferral election.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .

A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your Performance-Based
Restricted Stock and acknowledge that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice. Please
see Paragraph 10.F regarding Section 83(b) elections.

4

B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you
(the “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on
account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related Items”), is and
remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You further acknowledge
that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in
connection with any aspect of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement
of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any
dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the PerformanceBased Restricted Stock to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you
are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former
employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related
Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock. In the event that
such withholding in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences,
by your acceptance of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any
broker or other third party designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole number of Shares corresponding to the vested
Performance-Based Restricted Stock that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient
to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by any
other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding from your wages or other cash
compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable
rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have
been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock, notwithstanding that a number of
the Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an excess
amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory body. In the event
that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled to receive a refund of any
over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your
5

participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the
proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
F.
By accepting this Agreement, you agree not to make a Code Section 83(b) election with respect to this award of
Performance-Based Restricted Stock.
11. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Not Transferable . The Performance-Based Restricted Stock may not be sold, conveyed,
assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the Performance-Based
Restricted Stock and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation of this Paragraph 11 shall be null,
void, and without effect.
12. Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award Notification
of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award to the contrary, the grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock also shall be subject
to any special terms and conditions as set forth in any appendix attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules,
and regulations specific to your country. Moreover, if you relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special
terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and
conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award Notification of Award and Terms and Conditions of Award and, together, these
documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or
other right to receive future grants of Performance-Based Restricted Stock or other awards, or benefits in lieu of Performance-Based
Restricted Stock, even if performance-based restricted stock has been granted in the past;
C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of Performance-Based Restricted Stock or other awards, if any, will be at
the sole discretion of the Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with or limit
in any way the right of Walmart or the Employer, if different, to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor confer upon you
the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, and
the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your
Performance-Based Restricted Stock;
6

F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, and
the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;
I.
the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, and
the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited
to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service
awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments;
J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the
Performance-Based Restricted Stock, and the income and the value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection
with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock is unknown, indeterminable and
cannot be predicted with certainty;
L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Performance-Based
Restricted Stock and the Shares underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock resulting from the termination of your
Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the
jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the
Performance-Based Restricted Stock to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree (i) never to institute any claim
against Walmart or any Affiliate; (ii) waive your ability, if any, to bring such claim, and (iii) release Walmart and all Affiliates from
such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating
in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents
necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim;
M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right to
receive and vest in the Performance-Based Restricted Stock under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are
no longer actively providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of service
would not include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws
in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the
exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes
7

of this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the Performance-Based Restricted Stock and
the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, the Shares
underlying the Performance-Based Restricted Stock, or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be
exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares underlying the Performance-Based
Restricted Stock; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
Performance-Based Restricted Stock or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Performance-Based Restricted
Stock or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the RSUs
acquired upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to
participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart
and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You
understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your
name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number or other identification number,
salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all RSUs or any other awards
granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and
its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is assisting Walmart in the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in your
country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections
than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by
contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and any
other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the
Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of Data as may be required to
Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement,
administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may, at any
time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and
8

processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost,
by contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents
herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and
career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that
Walmart would not be able to grant RSUs or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you
understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the
consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.

9

I.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and

legal or administrative reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to
accomplish the foregoing.
J.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not

K.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your
ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined in the
laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s insider trading
policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and any applicable
Walmart insider trading policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
L.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds arising
from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or legal entity
located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts, assets, the balances
therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such country. You acknowledge that
you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account, exchange control and tax reporting
requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver any
Shares issuable upon vesting of the Performance-Based Restricted Stock prior to the completion of any registration or qualification
of the Shares under any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or
other clearance from any local, state, federal or foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval Walmart
shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation to register or
qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any
governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend
restrictions upon Shares underlying your vested Performance-Based Restricted Stock and issue “stop transfer” instructions requiring
compliance with applicable U.S. or other securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart
shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with
securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
SHARE-SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
These Share-Settled Restricted Stock Unit Notification and Terms and Conditions, including any applicable special terms and
conditions for your specific country set forth in the appendix attached hereto (jointly, the “Agreement”), contain the terms and
conditions of the Restricted Stock Units or RSUs (as defined in the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the “Plan”))
granted to you by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), a Delaware corporation, under the Plan.
All the terms and conditions of the Plan are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. All capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan.
BY SIGNING OR ELECTRONICALLY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTAND, AGREE TO, AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING:
1.
Grant of RSUs . Walmart has granted to you, effective on the Grant Date, the RSUs, which consist of the right to receive
the number of Shares underlying the RSUs set forth above on the Vesting Date as further set forth in Paragraph 5 below, subject to
certain vesting conditions.
2.
Plan Governs . The RSUs and this Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. You are accepting the
RSUs, acknowledging receipt of a copy of the Plan and the prospectus covering the Plan, and acknowledging that the RSUs and your
participation in the Plan are subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and of this Agreement. You further agree to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions and interpretations by the Committee upon any disputes or questions arising under the
Plan.
3.
Payment . You are not required to pay for the RSUs or the Shares underlying the RSUs granted to you pursuant to this
Agreement.
4.

Stockholder Rights . Unless and until your RSUs vest and the underlying Shares have been delivered to you:
A.

You do not have the right to vote the Shares underlying your RSUs;
1

B.
you shall have the right to receive, free of vesting conditions (but subject to applicable withholding taxes),
dividend equivalent payments made in the form of cash (paid to you in your normal payroll), until the Vesting Date(s) shown
below; and
C.
You will not have any other beneficial rights as a shareholder of Walmart due to the RSUs. Upon receipt of the
Shares, however, you will be accorded the same rights and responsibilities as any shareholder of Walmart, and will be
provided with information regarding Walmart that is provided to all other shareholders of Walmart.
5.
Vesting of the RSUs and Delivery of Shares . Your RSUs will vest as follows, provided you have not incurred a Forfeiture
Condition (as defined in Paragraph 6 below):
Percentage of RSUs Vesting

Vesting Date

Upon the vesting of your RSUs, subject to Paragraph 9 below, you shall be entitled to receive a number of Shares equal to
the number of vested RSUs, less any Shares withheld or sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations as set forth in Paragraph 10
below. The Shares shall be delivered to you as soon as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the Vesting Date.
Such Shares will be deposited into an account in your name with a broker or other third party designated by Walmart. You will be
responsible for all fees imposed by such designated broker or other third party designated by Walmart.
Furthermore, Walmart or Wal-Mart Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle
your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you
hereby acknowledge and agree that such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in
respect of the vested RSUs to an independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any
Shares so purchased on the open market shall be delivered to you as set forth in this Paragraph 5.
6.
Forfeiture Conditions . Subject to Paragraph 8 below, the RSUs that would otherwise vest in whole or in part on the
Vesting Date will not vest and will be immediately forfeited if, prior to the Vesting Date:
A.
your Continuous Status terminates for any reason (other than death or Disability, to the extent provided in
Paragraph 8 below); or
B.
You have not executed and delivered to Walmart a Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use Agreement, in a form to be
provided to you by Walmart.
Each of the events described in Paragraphs 6.A and 6.B above shall be referred to as a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of
this Agreement. Furthermore, if applicable, you shall be advised if the Committee has determined that your acceptance of this Plan
Award is further
2

conditioned upon your execution and delivery to Walmart of a Post Termination Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete, in a
form to be provided to you by Walmart. If applicable, the failure to execute and deliver such Post Termination Agreement and
Covenant Not to Compete shall also be deemed a “Forfeiture Condition” for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a
Forfeiture Condition, you shall have no further rights with respect to such RSUs (including any cash dividends related to the RSUs
for which the record date occurs on or after the date of the forfeiture) or the underlying Shares.
7.
Administrative Suspension . If you are subject to an administrative suspension, vesting of your RSUs may be suspended as
of the date you are placed on administrative suspension. If you are not reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the
administrative suspension period, your RSUs may be immediately forfeited and you shall have no further rights with respect to such
RSUs or the underlying Shares. If you are reinstated as an Associate in good standing at the end of the administrative suspension
period, then the vesting of your RSUs will resume as provided in Paragraph 5, and any RSUs that would have vested while you were
on administrative suspension will vest and the number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs will be delivered to you as soon
as administratively feasible, but in any event within 74 days of the end of the administrative suspension period which shall be
considered the Vesting Date for purposes of this Paragraph 7.
8.
Accelerated Vesting; Vesting Notwithstanding Termination of Continuous Status by Death or Disability . Your RSUs will
vest earlier than described in Paragraph 5 above, and such earlier vesting date shall also be considered a Vesting Date, under the
following circumstances:
A.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by your Disability, your RSUs that would have become vested on a
Vesting Date no more than 90 days after your Continuous Status is so terminated will become vested on the date your
Continuous Status is so terminated. “Disability” for the purpose of this Agreement means, unless provided otherwise by a
policy of Walmart, a physical or mental condition resulting from bodily injury, disease or mental disorder that constitutes
total disability under applicable laws and regulations, for which disability benefits have actually been approved. It is your
responsibility to notify Global Equity in the event you terminate due to Disability; or
B.
If your Continuous Status is terminated by reason of your death on or after ten years of service or on or after the
third anniversary of the Grant Date, then your unvested Restricted Stock shall immediately become fully vested.
For purposes of this Paragraph 8, your Continuous Status will be considered terminated on the date of death or the date on
which your employment or other service relationship has been legally terminated by reason of Disability.
9.

Deferral .
A.
Mandatory Deferral. If Walmart reasonably anticipates that the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs in
any year would, when considered with your other compensation, result in Walmart’s inability to deduct the value of such
Shares because of the limitation on deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, then
3

Walmart shall defer the delivery of such Shares until the first year in which Walmart reasonably anticipates that the related
deduction will not be limited under Section 162(m) of the Code (the “First Non-162(m) Year”) in accordance with the
deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code. However, if you have made an
irrevocable election to defer such Shares to a date later than the First Non-162(m) Year, then Walmart shall not deliver such
Shares in the First Non-162(m) Year, but shall instead deliver your Shares in accordance with your irrevocable election and
the deferral procedures established pursuant to the Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
B.
Elective Deferral of Restricted Stock Units . If you are eligible to defer delivery of the Shares underlying your
Restricted Stock award to a future date in accordance with Section 8.7 of the Plan and rules and procedures relating thereto,
you will be advised as to when any such deferral election must be made and the rules and procedures applicable to such
deferral election.
10.

Taxes and Tax Withholding .
A.
You agree to consult with any tax advisors you think necessary in connection with your RSUs and acknowledge
that you are not relying, and will not rely, on Walmart or any Affiliate for any tax advice.
B.
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by Walmart or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you
(the “Employer”), the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, pension, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment
on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“Tax-Related
Items”) is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Walmart or the Employer. You
further acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment
of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or
settlement of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends;
and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the RSUs or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce
or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to TaxRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Walmart and/or the Employer (or your former employer,
as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
C.
Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactory to Walmart and the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Walmart and/or the
Employer, or their respective agents, at their sole discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all TaxRelated Items by withholding of Shares to be issued upon settlement of the vested RSUs. In the event that such withholding
in Shares is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, by your
acceptance of the RSUs and this Agreement, you authorize and direct Walmart, and any broker or other third party
designated by Walmart to sell on your behalf a whole
4

number of Shares corresponding to the vested RSUs that Walmart or the Employer determines to be appropriate to generate
cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items. However, Walmart may also require you to satisfy
the Tax-Related Items by any other method of withholding it authorizes, in its sole discretion, including through withholding
from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Walmart or any Affiliate.
D.
Depending on the withholding method, Walmart or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items
by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum
applicable rates. Further, if the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you
are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the
Shares are withheld solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. If as a result of withholding whole Shares, an
excess amount of tax is withheld, such excess tax will be reported and paid to the applicable tax authorities or regulatory
body. In the event that any excess amounts are withheld to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items, you may be entitled
to receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in the form of cash and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent.
E.
Finally, you agree to pay to Walmart or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Walmart or the
Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by
the means previously described. Walmart may refuse to deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to
comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
11.
RSUs Not Transferable . The RSUs may not be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of or
encumbered at any time prior to vesting of the RSUs and the issuance of the underlying Shares. Any attempted action in violation of
this Paragraph 11 shall be null, void, and without effect.
12.
Country-Specific Appendix . Notwithstanding any provision in these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Terms
and Conditions to the contrary, the grant of RSUs also shall be subject to any special terms and conditions set forth in any appendix
attached hereto (the “Appendix”) with respect to certain laws, rules, and regulations specific to your country. Moreover, if you
relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the
extent Walmart determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
reasons. The Appendix is incorporated by reference into these Global Share-Settled RSU Notification and Terms and Conditions
and, together, these documents constitute this Agreement.
13.

Nature of Plan Award . You further acknowledge, understand and agree that:
A.

the Plan is established voluntarily by Walmart and is discretionary in nature;

B.
the grant of RSUs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
grants of RSUs or other awards, or benefits in lieu of RSUs, even if RSUs have been granted in the past;
5

C.
all decisions with respect to future grants of RSUs or other awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the
Committee;
D.
neither this Agreement nor the Plan creates any contract of employment with any entity involved in the
management or administration of the Plan or this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall interfere with
or limit in any way the right of Walmart or, if different, the Employer to terminate your Continuous Status at any time, nor
confer upon you the right to continue in the employ of Walmart or any Affiliate;
E.
the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, relate exclusively to your
Continuous Status during the vesting period applicable to your RSUs;
F.
nothing in this Agreement or the Plan creates any fiduciary or other duty owed to you by Walmart, any Affiliate, or
any member of the Committee, except as expressly stated in this Agreement or the Plan;
G.

you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;

H.
the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, are not intended to replace any
pension rights or compensation;
I.
the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or
expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation,
termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare
benefits or similar payments;
J.
unless otherwise agreed with Walmart, the RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and the
value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service (if any) you may provide as a director
of any Affiliate;
K.
the future value of the Shares underlying the RSUs is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with
certainty;
L.
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the RSUs and the Shares
underlying the RSUs resulting from the termination of your Continuous Status (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your
employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the RSUs to which you are otherwise not entitled, you
irrevocably agree (i) never to institute any claim against Walmart or any Affiliate; (ii) waive your ability, if any, to bring
such claim, and (iii) release Walmart and all Affiliates from such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is
allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have
agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of
such claim;
6

M.
in the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of
employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right
to receive and vest in the RSUs under the Plan, if any, may terminate effective as of the date that you are no longer actively
providing services and may not be extended by any notice period under local law ( e.g. , your period of service would not
include any contractual notice period or any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any); the Committee shall have the
exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of this Agreement (including
whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence);
N.
unless otherwise provided in the Plan or by Walmart in its discretion, the RSUs and the benefits evidenced by this
Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the RSUs, the Shares underlying the RSUs, or any such benefits transferred
to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction
affecting the Shares underlying the RSUs; and
O.
if you are providing services outside of the United States: neither Walmart nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any
foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the
RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired
upon settlement.
14.
No Advice Regarding Award . Walmart and/or its Affiliates are not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor are
Walmart or any Affiliate making any recommendation regarding your participation in the Plan or the Shares underlying the RSUs
acquired upon vesting. You are advised to consult with your personal tax, legal, and financial advisors regarding the decision to
participate in the Plan and before taking any action related to the Plan.
15.
Data Privacy . You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other
form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other grant materials by and among, as applicable, Walmart
and any Affiliate for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan. You
understand that Walmart and its Affiliates may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your
name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance identification number or other identification number,
salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Walmart or an Affiliate, details of all RSUs or any other awards
granted, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing,
administering and managing the Plan. You understand that Data may be transferred to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and
its affiliates or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by Walmart in the future, which is assisting Walmart in the
implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in your
country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections
than your country. You understand that you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of Data by
contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize
7

Walmart, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and any other possible recipients which may assist Walmart (presently or in the
future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer Data, in electronic or
other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any
requisite transfer of Data as may be required to Walmart’s designated broker or other third party. You understand that Data will be
held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you
reside outside the United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing
of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by
contacting in writing your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein
on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your Continuous Status and career
with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that Walmart
would not be able to grant RSUs or other Plan Awards to you or administer or maintain such Plan Awards. Therefore, you
understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the
consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources
representative.
16.

Other Provisions .
A.
Determinations regarding this Agreement (including, but not limited to, whether an event has occurred resulting in
the forfeiture of or accelerated vesting of the RSUs) shall be made by the Committee in its sole and exclusive discretion and
in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan, and all determinations of the Committee shall be final and conclusive and
binding on you and your successors and heirs.
B.
Walmart reserves the right to amend, abandon or terminate the Plan, including this Agreement, at any time subject
to Committee approval. Nothing in the Plan should be construed as to create any expectations that the Plan will be in force
and effect for an indefinite period of time nor shall give rise to any claims to acquired rights or similar legal theories.
C.
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee’s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and
may be made by the Committee selectively among recipients and eligible Associates, whether or not such persons are
similarly situated.
D.

By accepting this Agreement, you agree to provide any information reasonably requested from time to time.

E.
This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law
provisions.
F.
The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or
otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
8

G.
If you receive this Agreement or any other documents related to your Plan Award or the Plan translated into a
language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English
language version of such document will control.
H.
Walmart may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to your current or future participation
in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to
participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Walmart or a third party
designated by Walmart.
I.
Walmart reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on your Plan Award, and
the Shares underlying the RSUs, to the extent Walmart determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative
reasons and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the
foregoing.
J.
You acknowledge that a waiver by Walmart or an Affiliate of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by
you or any other Associate.
K.
You understand that your country may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws which may affect your
ability to acquire or sell Shares under the Plan during such times you are considered to have “inside information” (as defined
in the laws in your country). The restrictions applicable under these laws may be the same or different from Walmart’s
insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations
and any applicable Walmart insider trader policy, and are advised to speak to your personal legal advisor on this matter.
L.
You understand that you may be subject to foreign asset/account, exchange control and/or tax reporting
requirements as a result of the acquisition, holding and/or transfer of Shares or cash (including dividends and the proceeds
arising from the sale of Shares) derived from your participation in the Plan in, to and/or from a brokerage/bank account or
legal entity located outside your country. The applicable laws of the your country may require that you report such accounts,
assets, the balances therein, the value thereof and/or the transactions related thereto to the applicable authorities in such
country. You acknowledge that you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable foreign asset/account,
exchange control and tax reporting requirements, and you are advised to consult your personal legal advisor on this matter.
M.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from
any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the Shares, Walmart shall not be required to deliver
any Shares issuable upon vesting of the RSUs prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of the Shares under
any local, state, federal or foreign securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any
9

other governmental regulatory body, or prior to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any local, state, federal or
foreign governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval Walmart shall, in its absolute discretion, deem
necessary or advisable. You understand that Walmart is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or
any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance
or sale of the Shares. Walmart may, without liability for its good faith actions, place legend restrictions upon Shares
underlying your vested RSUs and issue “stop transfer” instructions requiring compliance with applicable U.S. or other
securities laws and the terms of the Agreement and Plan. Further, you agree that Walmart shall have unilateral authority to
amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws
applicable to issuance of Shares.
Grantee:
I acknowledge that the Plan and this Agreement have been made available to me and that I have read and understood these
documents. I accept the terms and conditions of my RSU award as set forth in this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2015
SHARE-SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT NOTIFICATION
AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC APPENDIX
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Share-Settled RSU
Notification and Terms and Conditions (the “T&C’s”).
Terms and Conditions . This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the RSUs granted to you under the Plan
if you work and/or reside in one of the countries listed below.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, Walmart shall, in its
discretion, determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you .
Notifications . This Appendix also includes information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be
aware with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in
effect in the respective countries as of November 2015. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Walmart
strongly recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the
consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that the RSUs vest or you
receive a cash payout under the Plan.
In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and Walmart is not
in a position to assure you of a particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional advice as to how the
relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation.
Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working and/or residing, transfer
Continuous Status after the Grant Date, or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the notifications
contained herein may not be applicable to you in the same manner.
ARGENTINA
Notifications
Securities Law Information . Neither the RSUs nor any Shares subject to the RSUs are publicly offered or listed on any stock
exchange in Argentina. The offer is private and not subject to the supervision of any Argentine governmental authority.
1

Exchange Control Information . If you transfer proceeds from the sale of any Shares acquired under the Plan into Argentina within
10 days of sale ( i.e. , if the proceeds have not been held in a U.S. bank or brokerage account for at least 10 days prior to transfer),
you must deposit 30% of the sale proceeds into a non-interest bearing account in Argentina for 365 days. If you have satisfied the 10
day holding obligation, the Argentine bank handling the transaction may request certain documentation in connection with your
request to transfer sale proceeds into Argentina, including evidence of the sale and proof of the source of funds used to purchase the
Shares. If the bank determines that the 10-day rule or any other rule or regulation promulgated by the Argentine Central Bank has
not been satisfied, it will require that 30% of the transfer amount be placed in a non-interest bearing dollar denominated mandatory
deposit account for a holding period of 365 days. You understand that you must comply with any and all Argentine currency
exchange restrictions, approvals and reporting requirements in connection with the RSUs and your participation in the Plan.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . If you are an Argentine tax resident, you must report any Shares acquired under the
Plan and held by you on December 31st of each year on your annual tax return for that year.
BRAZIL

Termination of Continuous Status . This provision replaces Paragraph 13(M) of the T&C’s:
In the event of the termination of your Continuous Status (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws
in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), your right to receive and vest in the
RSUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that is the earlier of (i) the date on which your Continuous Status
is terminated, (ii) the date on which you receive a notice of termination of Continuous Status, or (iii) the date on which you are no
longer providing active services to Walmart or any Affiliate, regardless of any notice period or period of pay in lieu of such notice

this Agreement (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a leave of absence).
Vesting and Delivery of Shares . This provision supplements Paragraph 5 of the T&C’s:
Instead of delivering Shares upon vesting of your RSUs to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C's, Walmart or Wal-Mart
Canada Corp. or an Affiliate (“WM Canada”), in their sole discretion, also may settle your vested RSUs in cash, Shares, or a
combination of cash and Shares. To the extent your Plan Award will be settled in Shares, you hereby acknowledge and agree that
such settlement will be satisfied by WM Canada by forwarding a cash settlement amount in respect of the vested RSUs to an
independent broker who will in turn purchase the Shares on the open market on your behalf. Any Shares so purchased on the open
market shall be delivered to you as set forth in Paragraph 5 of the T&C’s.
The Following Provisions Apply to Associates and Non-Management Directors Resident in Quebec:
Language Consent . The parties acknowledge that it is their express wish that the Agreement, as well as all documents, notices, and

and any stock plan service provider that may be selected by Walmart to assist with the Plan to disclose and discuss the Plan with
their respective advisors. You further authorize Walmart or an Affiliate to record such information and to keep such information in
your employee file.

Foreign Asset/ Account Reporting Information . Foreign property, including shares of stock (i.e., Shares) and other rights to receive
Shares ( e.g. , RSUs) of a non-Canadian company held by a Canadian resident employee must generally be reported annually on a
Form T1135 (Foreign Income Verification Statement), if the total cost of his or her foreign property exceeds C$100,000 at any time
during the year. Thus, RSUs likely must be reported (generally at a nil cost) if the C$100,000 cost threshold is exceeded because of
other foreign property you hold. When Shares are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the Shares. The
ACB ordinarily is equal to the fair market value of the Shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other Shares (acquired
separately), this ACB may have to be averaged with the ACB of the other Shares.
CHILE
Terms and Conditions
Labor Law Acknowledgement . The RSUs and the Shares underlying the RSUs, and the income and value of same, shall not be
considered as part of the your remuneration for purposes of determining the calculation base of future indemnities, whether statutory

Securities Law Information . This grant of RSUs constitutes a private offering of securities in Chile effective as of the Grant Date.
This offer of RSUs is made subject to general ruling n° 336 of the Chilean Superintendence of Securities and Insurance (“SVS”).
The offer refers to securities not registered at the securities registry or at the foreign securities registry of the SVS, and, therefore,
such securities are not subject to oversight of the SVS. Given that the RSUs are not registered in Chile, Walmart is not required to
provide public information about the RSUs or the Shares in Chile. Unless the RSUs and/or the Shares are registered with the SVS, a
public offering of such securities cannot be made in Chile.
Esta Oferta de RSUs constituye una oferta privada de valores en Chile y se inicia en la Fecha de la Oferta. Esta oferta de RSUs se
acoge a las disposiciones de la Norma de Carácter General Nº 336 (“NCG 336”) de la Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros de
Chile (“SVS”). Esta oferta versa sobre valores no inscritos en el Registro de Valores o en el Registro de Valores Extranjeros que
lleva la SVS, por lo que tales valores no están sujetos a la fiscalización de ésta. Por tratarse de valores no inscritos en Chile no
existe la obligación por parte de Walmart de entregar en Chile información pública respecto de los mismos. Estos valores no
podrán ser objeto de oferta pública en Chile mientras no sean inscritos en el Registro de Valores correspondiente.
Exchange Control Information . You are not required to repatriate any funds you receive with respect to the RSUs ( e.g. , any
proceeds from the sale of any Shares issued upon vesting of the RSUs) to Chile. However, if you decide to repatriate such funds, you
acknowledge that you will
4

be required to effect such repatriation through the Formal Exchange Market ( i.e. , a commercial bank or registered foreign exchange
office) if the amount of the funds repatriated exceeds US$10,000. Further, if the value of your aggregate investments held outside of
Chile exceeds US$5,000,000 at any time in a calendar year, you must report the status of such investments to the Central Bank of
Chile.
You will also be required to provide certain information to the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (“CIRS”) regarding the results of
investments held abroad and the taxes you have paid abroad (if you will be seeking a credit against Chilean income tax owed). This
information must be submitted on an electronic sworn statement, Formulario 1851 (for investments held abroad) and Formulario
1853 (for taxes paid abroad) before March 15 of each year. The formularios may be found at the CIRS website at www.sii.cl .

advisor regarding any obligations that you may have in connection with the RSUs.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our
operations, we help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile
capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping. Physical retail
encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile
commerce applications. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce
websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leading
on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP
is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional
activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to
our customers. Our digital and physical presence, which we are investing in to integrate, provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.
We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.
Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
•

Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has
historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to
the Company's net sales and operating income.

•

Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These businesses consist of
numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement,
specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is
lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions,
as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding digital retail.

•

Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as digital retail. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a
significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage
of net sales than our other segments.

Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently, but each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's
net sales and operating income in recent years.
Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar
year basis. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, our
highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 .
This discussion, which presents our results for periods occurring in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "), January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 ") and
January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 ") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this
discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial
statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to
assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a
better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store
and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain
corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain
corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so,
the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.
Comparable store and club sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores
and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable store and
club sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as ecommerce sales. We measure the e-commerce sales impact by including those sales initiated through our websites and our mobile commerce applications and
fulfilled through our e-commerce distribution facilities, as well as an estimate for sales initiated online and on our mobile commerce applications, but fulfilled
through our stores and clubs. Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from
3

Table of Contents
comparable store and club sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square
feet of more than five percent. Comparable store and club sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of
calculating comparable store and club sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store and club sales is not necessarily
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In discussing our operating results, we use the term "currency exchange rates" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all
countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currency
exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange
rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of
this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating
income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.
We made certain reclassifications to prior period amounts or balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These reclassifications did not
impact the Company's operating income or consolidated net income.
The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar,
variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or
international chains or have a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in
attracting and retaining quality employees (whom we call "associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but
not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit
availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions,
insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating
results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 , and in the discussion under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information" in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 .

Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our
business strategies to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the countries in which we operate. For several years, our
performance metrics emphasized three financial priorities: growth, leverage and returns. We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the
integration of digital and physical retail. These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported
by everyday low cost. During this time of increased investments, we have shifted our financial priorities to focus primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term
health of the Company including returns. We will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, and through increasing comparable store and club sales, which
include our e-commerce sales. While leverage remains important to everyday low cost, during this time of increased investments, operating expenses may grow at
a rate that is greater than or equal to the rate of our net sales growth, and operating income may grow at a rate that is equal to or less than the rate of our net sales
growth.
Our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing
working capital to deliver strong free cash flow. We will also continue to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Growth
We measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over-period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales. We also review the
progress of our digital retail investments by measuring the impact e-commerce sales have on our comparable store and club sales. At times, we make strategic
investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales
in the near term.

Our consolidated net sales decreased $3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal
year. Net sales for fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease
in fuel sales primarily due to the lower selling prices of fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors was offset by 1.3% year-over-year
growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The increase in net sales for
fiscal 2015 was primarily due to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales across the
Company. The increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal 2015.
Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales
Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores
and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable
store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club
sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our
calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable
store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store and
club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , were as follows:

Fuel Impact

Comparable store and club sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 0.3% and 0.5% in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal
year. The fiscal 2016 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted
5

Table of Contents
by continued traffic improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel
sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.2% and 0.6% for
Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2016 . The fiscal 2015 total U.S. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by higher traffic
during the end of the fiscal year. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.3% and 0.2% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club,
respectively, for fiscal 2015 .
As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the U.S., we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.
We estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.8% and 0.9% in
fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based
on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are
opened.
Strategic Growth Investments
During fiscal 2016, we made capital investments globally of $11.5 billion . These capital investments primarily consisted of payments to add new stores and clubs,
remodel existing stores and clubs, construct distribution centers and invest in technology. In addition, we made an incremental operational investment of $296
million in e-commerce in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. We also made operational investments of approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016 in connection
with the new associate wage structure and comprehensive associate training and educational programs announced in first quarter of fiscal 2016. These operational
investments will continue into the year ending January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017").

Returns
While we are focused primarily on growth, we also place a priority on generating returns to ensure our approach is appropriately balanced. We generate returns by
efficiently deploying assets and effectively managing working capital. We monitor these efforts through our return on investment and free cash flow metrics, which
we discuss below. In addition, we are focused on providing returns to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the
Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Investment
Management believes return on investment ("ROI") is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is
deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.
ROI was 15.5% and 16.9% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating
income, as well as continued capital investments.
We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year divided
by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average
accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor
equal to the rent for the fiscal year multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are
included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the U.S. ("GAAP"). For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our
calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. We consider
return on assets ("ROA") to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation
of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated income from continuing operations for the period divided by average total assets of continuing operations
for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets of continuing operations for
the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested
capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to
investors than ROA.
Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate
our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional
cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be
considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by
operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We generated
free cash flow of $15.9 billion , $16.4 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in free cash flow in fiscal 2016 from
fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the
measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we
believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by
Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to
be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used
in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, decreased 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased 2.0% for
fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales decreased 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased 1.9% for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous
fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , net sales were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a decrease of $1.9 billion
in fuel sales that resulted primarily from lower selling prices for fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales
was partially offset by the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales
across the Company. For fiscal 2015 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in
the U.S. and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency
exchange rates for fiscal 2015 .
Our gross profit rate increased 29 basis points for fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. Improved margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables in
the Walmart U.S. segment positively impacted our gross profit rate. Changes in the merchandise mix in the Walmart International segment and a reduction in low
margin fuel sales in the Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate, while continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure at the Walmart U.S.
segment negatively impacted our gross profit rate. Our gross profit rate was relatively flat in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 and 6 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
For fiscal 2016 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment due
to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve the overall customer experience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the store
closures announced in January 2016 and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology. For f iscal 2015 , the increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to our continued investments in digital retail and higher health-care expenses in the U.S. from increased enrollment
in our associate health-care plans and medical cost inflation, the $249 million impact of wage and hour litigation in the U.S., as well as expenses of $148 million
related to the closure of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan. The impact of these factors in the increase of operating expenses as a percentage of net
sales for fiscal 2015 was partially offset by nearly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% , 32.2% and 32.9% for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period
and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of
administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory
rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $15.1 billion , $16.8 billion and $16.6 billion of consolidated income from continuing operations for fiscal
2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively; a decrease of $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and an increase of $263 million for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal
year. Diluted income from continuing operations per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $4.57 , $4.99 and $4.85 for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,
respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased 3.6% and 3.1% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases
in net sales were primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.4% and 3.2% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as well as increases in
comparable store sales of 1.0% and 0.6% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Positive customer traffic and higher e-commerce sales contributed to the increases
in comparable store sales in both periods.
The fiscal 2016 gross profit rate increased 12 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandise,
and consumables, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. The fiscal 2015 gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points when compared to the
previous fiscal year, primarily due to the result of the segment's strategic focus on price investment, pharmacy cost inflation, reductions in third-party
reimbursement rates and changes in merchandise mix.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 113 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the previous
fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate
hours. Enhancements to the customer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increased
maintenance expenses. In addition, the approximately $700 million charge for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in store associate
incentive expense and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the fiscal 2016 increase in operating expenses as a
percentage of segment net sales. For fiscal 2015 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily driven by higher healthcare expenses from increased enrollment in our associate health-care plans and medical cost inflation. In addition, expenses from severe winter storms early in
fiscal 2015 contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was $19.1 billion , $21.3 billion and $21.8 billion during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,
respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased 9.4% and 0.3% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For
fiscal 2016 , the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the $17.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and negative
comparable sales in the U.K. and China, partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and positive comparable sales in Mexico and
Canada. For fiscal 2015 , the decrease in net sales was primarily due to $5.3 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, partially offset
by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.6% and higher e-commerce sales in each country with e-commerce operations, particularly in the United
Kingdom, China and Brazil.
Gross profit r ate increased 23 and 12 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The fiscal
2016 and 2015 increases in gross profit rate were primarily due to changes in the merchandise mix in certain markets.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 basis points for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closure
of 115 underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets in January 2016, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates in
Brazil and continued investments in digital retail and information technology.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 51 basis points for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year due to the nearly $1.0
billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014 , including charges for contingencies in Brazil, store closure costs in China and Brazil, store lease expenses
in China and Mexico and expenses for the termination of the joint venture in India, partially offset by fiscal 2015 expenses of $148 million related to the closure of
approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was $5.3 billion , $6.2 billion and $5.2 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating income $765 million , $225 million and $26 million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,
respectively.

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased 2.1% for fiscal 2016 and increased 1.5% for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year. The fiscal 2016
decrease in net sales was primarily due to declines in comparable club sales, which were driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resulted primarily
from lower selling prices for fuel. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and higher e-commerce sales
at samsclub.com. The fiscal 2015 increase in net sales was primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.5%, driven by the addition of 15 new
clubs, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices. Comparable club sales were flat for fiscal 2015.
Gross profit rate increased 30 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 12 basis points for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016
, the increase was primarily due to the reduction in low margin fuel sales and lower merchandise acquisition costs, partially offset by the segment's continued
investment in the Cash Rewards program. Fo r fiscal 2015 , the gross profit rate decreased primarily due to the segment's investment in the Cash Rewards program,
changes in merchandise mix, and commodity cost inflation, partially offset by an increased gross profit rate on fuel sales.
Membership and other incom e increased 5.3% and 7.7% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the
increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades and Plus Member renewals. For fiscal 2015 , the increase was primarily the result of increased
membership upgrades, Plus Member renewals and an increase in members from the opening of 15 new clubs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 67 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 16 basis points for fiscal 2015 , when compared to
the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales, an increase
in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure, our continued investments in new clubs, digital retail and information technology, and the approximately
$60 million charge for club closures announced in January 2016. For fiscal 2015 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was
primarily due to better expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the new in-club staffing structure announced in fiscal 2014, which
resulted in decreases in wage expense and payroll taxes.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating inco me was $1.8 billion , $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion f or fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,
supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support
the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and
share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global expansion activities, pay dividends and
fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.4 billion , $28.6 billion and $23.3 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in net cash
provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations,
partially offset by improved working capital management. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous
fiscal year, was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the timing of income tax payments.
In fiscal 2017, the Company will move forward with the second year of our new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and
educational programs which was announced in fiscal 2016. We anticipate cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund these programs in
fiscal 2017 and future years.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $4.4 billion and $2.0
billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit reflects the Company's efficient leverage achieved through
improved working capital management, in addition to the timing of payments. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash
in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share
repurchases.
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost
possible. We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash
flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to
continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations or through
intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the U.S.
statutory rate, we realize an effective tax rate benefit. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign
operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable
foreign tax credits. We do not expect local laws, other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a
material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, may not be freely
transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.

Net cash used in investing activities was $10.7 billion , $11.1 billion and $12.5 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and generally consisted of
payments to add stores and clubs, remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our digital retail capabilities and invest in other technologies. For fiscal 2016 , we
opened 423 new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $450 million and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when
compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to lower capital expenditures. The following table provides additional capital expenditure detail:

Cash proceeds of $671 million received from the sale of the Vips restaurant business in Mexico ("Vips") on May 12, 2014, which is further described in Note 13 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements, also reduced net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 .
We continued to focus on seamlessly integrating the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanding in digital retail in each of our
segments during fiscal 2016 . Some of our fiscal 2016 accomplishments in this area were to successfully launch "Walmart Pay," grow integrated mobile
applications and services including "Online Grocery" and "Pickup Today," continue to roll out our new web platform in the U.S. and open new e-commerce
dedicated fulfillment centers.
Growth Activities
In fiscal 2017, we plan to add between 342 and 405 new stores and clubs, which will include a continued investment in Neighborhood Markets and a moderation of
Supercenter growth in the U.S. compared to recent fiscal years. In addition, we plan to continue the growth of our digital retail capabilities by investing
approximately $1.1 billion in e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications that will include technology, infrastructure and other elements of our ecommerce operations to better serve our customers and support our stores and clubs. We anticipate financing these growth activities through cash flows provided
by operating activities and future debt financings.
The following table provides our projected fiscal 2017 capital expenditures. Our anticipated digital retail expenditures are included in our projected fiscal 2017

Net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and
the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used
in financing activities increased $1.1 billion and $4.3 billion for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal
year.
Short-term Borrowings
Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings increased $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016 and decreased $6.3 billion in fiscal 2015 , when compared to the balance at
the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments,
share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2016 , the increase in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings partially
offset a larger $2.0 billion decrease in long-term debt due within one year. For fiscal 2015 , more cash provided from operating activities combined with less cash
used for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 allowed us to minimize our

short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2015 . In addition to our short-term borrowings, we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit that provide
$15.0 billion of additional liquidity, if needed.

Our total outstanding long-term debt balance decreased $4.7 billion for the twelve months ended January 31, 2016 , primarily due to no significant new long-term
debt issuances in the current year offset by maturities of existing long-term debt.
Dividends
Our total dividend payments were $6.3 billion , $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. On February 18, 2016 , the Board of
Directors approved the fiscal 2017 annual dividend of $ 2.00 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2016 annual dividend of $1.96 per share. For fiscal 2017 , the
annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.50 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:

Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. On October 13,
2015, the Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had $8.6 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases
as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new share repurchase program
has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of
share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The
Company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,
current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significant
majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis,
the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :

Share repurchases increased $3.1 billion for fiscal 2016 and decreased $5.7 billion for fiscal 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For
fiscal 2016 , the increase in share repurchases resulted from our intention to utilize the current share repurchase authorization over the next two years. For fiscal
2015 , the decrease was a result of cash needs, reduced leverage and increased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below.
16

Table of Contents
Significant Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests
As described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in July 2015, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in
Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete this transaction and during fiscal 2015, we
completed the purchase of substantially all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Walmart Chile for approximately $1.5 billion, using existing cash to
complete this transaction.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows from continuing operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated
operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share
repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at
favorable rates in capital markets. At January 31, 2016 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as
follows:

Standard & Poor's
Moody's Investors Service
Fitch Ratings

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.
Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include
changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and
capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or
impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings
could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely
more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or
debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any
other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

"Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classified as fair value hedges.
"Capital lease and financing obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 in the
"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.

Additionally, the Company has $15.0 billion in undrawn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2016 , and management's forecasted
market rates for our variable rate debt.
Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital
expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included
in the table above. Purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for
the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on
our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the
obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with
respect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts
for some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $607 million of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as
liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for
additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations presented above, we have entered into certain arrangements, as discussed below, for which the timing of
payment, if any, is unknown.
The Company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately 215 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms ranging
from 10 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If leases for all of those future locations had been executed as of February 1, 2016, payments under
operating leases would increase by $34 million for fiscal 2017 , based on current estimates.
In connection with certain long-term debt issuances, we could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At January 31, 2016
, the aggregate termination payment would have been $44 million . The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal 2019 .

Table of Contents
Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not
represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,
however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by
managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2016 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased
approximately $162 million primarily due to additional interest rate swaps acquired in fiscal 2016 and fluctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents the
principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows
and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to
be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2016 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges.

As of January 31, 2016 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 19% of our total short-term
and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2016 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by
approximately $79 million .

Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2016 ,
movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in Canada, the United
Kingdom, Japan, Mexico and Chile were the primary cause of the $4.7 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currencydenominated long-term debt as net investment hedges.
We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure
associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position
of $290 million at January 31, 2016 and in a liability position of $110 million at January 31, 2015 . The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2016 . A hypothetical 10% increase or
decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2016 would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the
swaps of $445 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2016 would have resulted
in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of $14 million .
In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our
foreign operations. At January 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had £2.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United
Kingdom. At January 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a gain
or loss in the value of the debt of $324 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥10 billion at January 31, 2016 and ¥100 billion at January 31,
2015 , that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a gain or loss in the value of the debt of $8 million .
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in
non-functional currencies.
Other Matters
We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 , including certain risks arising therefrom, in
Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the caption "Risk Factors" and under the sub-caption "FCPA Investigation and Related Matters" in Note 10 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the
FCPA investigation in Item 3 of the Form 10-K under the caption "Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "II. Certain Other Proceedings." We
discuss the "equal value" claims against our United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA Stores, Ltd., in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 , including certain
risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of the Form 10-K under the caption "Risk Factors" and under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings" in Note 10 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," and appears elsewhere herein.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and
require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our
financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a
summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.
Inventories
We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for
substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method
of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since
permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued based on the
weighted-average cost using the LIFO method.
Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each
merchandise grouping's retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any
LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting
requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross
profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory
has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current
and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could
cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.
When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.
Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. At January 31, 2016 and 2015 , our
inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annual
inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results.
Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions
and operational performance, such as operating income and cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash
flows, which is generally at the individual store level or, in certain markets, at the market group level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of
conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These
factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management
determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a
quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is
more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a
quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows,
growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method
such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future
operating results could be materially impacted.
21

Table of Contents
As of January 31, 2016 , the fair value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets held in our International segment exceeded its carrying value of $398 million by
approximately 5%. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of these assets in future periods.
Income Taxes
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the
determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our
effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation
allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international
operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are
recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from
taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We
account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible
and taxable items.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors
are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of
future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by
assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and
available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores or
through the Company's e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly
integrates digital and physical shopping. Each week, the Company serves nearly 260 million customers who visit its over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28
countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and
deliver a great experience.
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 "),
January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 ") and January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014 "). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for
primarily using the equity method. These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31, for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The
Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during
January 2016 that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic
benefits transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions
classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In addition, cash and cash equivalents
included restricted cash of $362 million and $345 million at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from
various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements.
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents at
January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, $4.5 billion and $6.3 billion , respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity
needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum
cost possible. Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidity
needs will be met through cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the Company
intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. When the
income earned, either from operations or through intercompany financing arrangements, and indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. is taxed at local country tax
rates, which are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, the Company realizes an effective tax rate benefit. If the Company's intentions with respect to
reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under
current U.S. tax laws would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. The Company does not expect local laws, other limitations
or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S.
due to local laws or other restrictions.
31

Table of Contents
Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:
• insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;
• banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;
• consumer financing programs in certain international operations;
• suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and
• real estate transactions.
The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries. The
receivable balance from consumer credit products was $1.0 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $70 million at January 31, 2016 , compared to a
receivable balance of $1.2 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $ 114 million at January 31, 2015 . These balances are included in receivables, net, in
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out
("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the
retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at
the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club
segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the LIFO method. At January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company's inventories valued at
LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while
costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and
includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total
depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2016 , 2015
and 2014 was $9.4 billion , $9.1 billion and $8.8 billion , respectively. Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were $39 million , $59 million and $78
million in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Leases
The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the
abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected term
is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the
useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are
made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to
the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum
lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.
The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's
construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, regardless of the
significance of the payments, Accounting Standards
32

Table of Contents
Codification 840, Leases , ("ASC 840") defines those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and requires the Company to capitalize the lessor's total
project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC
840 to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is
deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are
generally amortized over the lease term.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are stated at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level
or, in certain circumstances, a market group of stores. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful
lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured
based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Impairment charges of
long-lived assets for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were not material.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting
unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended
use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative
assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an
assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the
reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative
test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow
method and relative market-based approaches.
The Company's reporting units were evaluated using a quantitative impairment test. Management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the
carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 :

Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions relates to acquisitions that are not significant, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for
impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no
impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain
employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the
balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative runout expenses related to
33

Table of Contents
the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, claims reserve valuations are provided by independent third-party actuaries to ensure
liability estimates are appropriate. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stoploss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary
differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.
Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings,
expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is
evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating
earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax
income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company
records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in
the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.
Revenue Recognition
Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. Digital retail sales include
shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. The
following table summarizes membership fee activity for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :

Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee is
included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Shopping Cards
Customer purchases of shopping cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the shopping card.
Shopping cards in the U.S. do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their shopping cards for merchandise indefinitely.
Shopping cards in certain foreign countries where the Company does business may have expiration dates. A certain number of shopping cards, both with and
without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed shopping cards and recognizes revenue for these amounts over shopping
card historical usage periods based on historical redemption rates. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates of usage periods and redemption
rates.
Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of
net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
34

Table of Contents
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of
transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import
distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific
programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of
sales and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except when the payment is a reimbursement of
specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the
majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating,
selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company does not include most of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments'
distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include
all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable
advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $2.5 billion
for fiscal 2016 and $2.4 billion for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 .
Pre-Opening Costs
The cost of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed as
incurred and included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled
$271 million , $317 million and $338 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance
sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The income statements of all
international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income
statements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to previous fiscal year amounts and balances to conform to the presentation in the current fiscal year. These
reclassifications did not impact consolidated operating income or net income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606). This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods
or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, FASB issued
ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt this
ASU on February 1, 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. Management is currently
evaluating this standard, including which transition approach to use, and does not expect this ASU to materially impact the Company's consolidated net income,
financial position or cash flows.
In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost . FASB issued
ASU 2015-03 to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to present the debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from
the carrying value of the debt liability rather than showing
35

Table of Contents
the debt issuance costs as a deferred charge on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Management elected to early adopt this new guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016,
and has applied the changes retrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of this ASU did not materially impact the Company's consolidated net income,
financial position or cash flows.
In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . This ASU requires the presentation
of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management elected to early adopt this new guidance effective for the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2016 in order to simplify the global close processes. The Company will apply the changes prospectively. Prior periods were not
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of this ASU. Adoption of this ASU did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial position, and
had no impact on the Company's net income or cash flows.
In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitative
disclosures are required, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating this standard.
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue
Gross versus Net) . The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent
considerations. The effective date for this ASU is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09. Management is currently evaluating this standard.
Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
relevant period. Diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding
that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted income per common share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2016 ,
2015 and 2014 .

The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's Stock
Incentive Plan of 2010. The Plan was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance shares units and other equity compensation
awards for which 210 million shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
•

Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions
related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0%
to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance
share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is
determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is
recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units
in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 7.4% , 7.1% and 6.7% , respectively.

•

Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from
the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of
grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.
The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used
to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 8.7% , 9.5% and 10.3% , respectively.

In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The
stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the other line in the table above.

Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On October 13,
2015, the Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had approximately $8.6 billion of remaining authorization for
share repurchases as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new share
repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. The share repurchases the
Company made during fiscal 2016 were made under both the old and new authorizations. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases
remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,
cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of
shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :

In June 2015, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial
paper program.

The committed lines of credit mature at various times between June 2016 and June 2020 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis
points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the lines of credit listed in the
table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt.
Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively. These letters of credit are utilized in normal business activities.
The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8, consists of the following:

The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted
by certain derivative financial instruments described in Note 8.
A portion of other debt at January 31, 2016 and 2015 includes secured debt in the amount of $131 million and $139 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an
aggregate carrying amount of approximately $13 million and $19 million , respectively.

At January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the
amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset

of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the
Company must repurchase the notes at par. Accordingly, this issuance has been classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset
could be sold in an ordinary transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the
amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability
with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
•
•
•

Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts the
Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the
income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the notional
amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value
measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not record any significant
impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 or 2015 .
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to
their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate
for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , are as follows:

Note 8. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange
rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company
to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedging
relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.
Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or
contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's
exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing
credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.
The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to
entering into derivative transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements,
including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $345 million and $323 million at January 31, 2016 and January 31,
2015 , respectively. The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part of
the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net
derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company had an insignificant amount of cash collateral posted with counterparties
at January 31, 2016 and did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2015 . The Company records cash collateral it posts with
counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the
contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are
effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge
accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges
and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which
the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.
Fair Value Instruments
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional
amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that
receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the
derivative instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fair
values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in
earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from
October 2020 to April 2024 .
Net Investment Instruments
The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixedrate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). These instruments will mature on dates ranging from October 2023 to February 2030 .
The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currencydenominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt
instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investments that
is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company had ¥10 billion and ¥100 billion ,
respectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £2.5 billion at January 31,
2016 and January 31, 2015 that was designated as a hedge of its net

investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 .
Cash Flow Instruments
The Company was a party to receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps that matured in July 2015 . The Company used these interest rate swaps to
hedge the interest rate risk of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of interest expense risk. Amounts reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these derivatives were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings as
interest was expensed for the Company's variable-rate debt, converting the variable-rate interest expense into fixed-rate interest expense.
The Company is also a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted
payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on
the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the
assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount
reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to
earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature on
dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 .
Financial Statement Presentation
Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Derivative instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on
maturity date, and those hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note
7 for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments.
The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows

Gains and losses related to the Company's derivatives primarily relate to interest rate hedges, which are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net
income during the next 12 months are not significant.

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation
The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations,
including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company's
significant accounting policies in Note 1. The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% U.S. statutory tax
rate. Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. and are not subject to current U.S. income tax. A reconciliation of the significant
differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:

Unremitted Earnings
U.S. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries of approximately $26.1 billion
and $23.3 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the U.S. However, if
any portion were to be distributed, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company provides
deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
At January 31, 2016 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $5.3 billion . Of these carryforwards,
approximately $3.0 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2036 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2016 , the
Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.8 billion , which will expire in various years through 2026 , if not utilized.
The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including
taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the
extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established. If a valuation allowance
has been established and management subsequently determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance is
released.
46

Table of Contents
The Company had valuation allowances recorded of approximately $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated
primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2016 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future
realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2016 , decreases due to
operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax
assets will be fully realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more likely than not probability
that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $607 million and $838 million , respectively. The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $522 million and $763 million for January 31, 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively.
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations was as follows:

The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,
respectively. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized interest and penalty expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions of $5 million ,
$18 million and $(7) million , respectively. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $60 million and $57 million ,
respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of
January 31, 2016 or 2015 .
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $150 million
, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as
expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve
months. The Company does not expect any change to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2016 . The Company also remains
subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2000 through 2016 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal
years ended 2008 through 2016 .
Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an
accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company's
shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Wage-and-Hour Class Action: The Company is a defendant in Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit commenced in March 2002 in the
Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented class
members from taking their full meal and rest breaks. On October 13, 2006 , a jury awarded back-pay damages to the plaintiffs of approximately $78 million on
their claims for off-the-clock work and missed rest breaks. The jury found in favor of the Company on the plaintiffs' meal-period claims.
47

Table of Contents
On November 14, 2007 , the trial judge entered a final judgment in the approximate amount of $188 million , which included the jury's back-pay award plus
statutory penalties, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. By operation of law, post-judgment interest accrues on the judgment amount at the rate of six percent
per annum from the date of entry of the judgment, which was November 14, 2007 , until the judgment is paid, unless the judgment is set aside on appeal. On
December 7, 2007 , the Company filed its Notice of Appeal. On June 10, 2011 , the Pennsylvania Superior Court of Appeals issued an opinion upholding the trial
court's certification of the class, the jury's back pay award, and the awards of statutory penalties and prejudgment interest, but reversing the award of attorneys'
fees. On September 9, 2011 , the Company filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. On July 2, 2012 , the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court granted the Company's Petition. On December 15, 2014, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued its opinion affirming the Superior Court of
Appeals' decision. At that time, the Company recorded expenses of $249 million for the judgment amount and post-judgment interest incurred to date. The
Company will continue to accrue for the post-judgment interest until final resolution. However, the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and
legal defenses to the claims at issue, and, on March 13, 2015, the Company filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 20, 2015,
the plaintiffs filed their response in opposition and on May 4, 2015, the Company filed its reply brief.
ASDA Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 7,000 "equal value" claims that are
proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former ASDA
store employees, who allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands
of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions
is not objectively justified. Claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and those higher
wage rates on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be asserted in the near future. On March 23,
2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK that
is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March 23, 2015,
ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to "strike out" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules. On July 23, 2015,
the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA's requests to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims. On September 2, 2015, ASDA filed a
Notice of Appeal with the Employment Appeal Tribunal seeking to appeal both rulings. On October 14, 2015, the Employment Appeal Tribunal denied ASDA's
requests for an appeal. Following additional argument and proceedings, the issue of "strike out" and the scope of Employment Tribunal Rules are subject of further
appellate review by the Employment Appeal Tribunal but the request to appeal the stay issue was denied by the Employment Appeal Tribunal. On March 8, 2016,
ASDA filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals seeking to appeal the Employment Appeal Tribunal's decision to disallow an appeal of the stay issue. At
present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from
these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.

FCPA Investigation and Related Matters
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an
internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in
connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or
misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and
other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters.
The Company is also conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged
in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company
voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since the
implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made
aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations are reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the
Company, together with their third party advisors, conduct inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, open investigations. Inquiries or investigations
regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not limited
to, Brazil, China and India.
The Company has been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that it is also the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. The
Company is cooperating with the investigations by the DOJ and the SEC. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated
investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to
the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, certain of its former directors,
certain of its current and former officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers.
The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in
respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments,
settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may
result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company cannot predict at this time the
outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or its own internal investigations and review. In addition, the Company has incurred
and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection
with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as
incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA
investigation and related matters:

These matters may require the involvement of certain members of the Company's senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote
to other matters relating to the business. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from
media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.
The Company's process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While the Company believes that it
is probable that it will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although the Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on its business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be
material to its business in the future.

Note 11. Commitments
The Company has long-term leases for stores and equipment. Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and
contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016 and $2.8 billion in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 .

Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales. Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal
2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals.
The Company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately 215 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms ranging
from 10 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If executed, payments under operating leases would increase by $34 million for fiscal 2017, based on
current cost estimates.
In connection with certain long-term debt issuances, the Company could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At
January 31, 2016 , the aggregate termination payment would have been $44 million . The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in
fiscal 2019 .
Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The
Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under
these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching
contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.
Participants age 50 or older may defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are
administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.
Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was
overfunded by $106 million and underfunded by $85 million at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The plan in Japan was underfunded by $205 million and
$223 million at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Overfunded amounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets
and deferred charges. Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain
other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant.

Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items
In fiscal 2016 , the Company completed the following transaction that impacts the operations of Walmart International:
Yihaodian
In July 2015, the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian, our e-commerce operations in China, for
approximately $760 million , using existing cash to complete this transaction.
In fiscal 2015, the Company completed the following transactions that impact the operations of Walmart International:
Walmart Chile
In fiscal 2014, the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders exercised put options that required the Company to purchase their shares in Walmart Chile. In
February 2014, the Company completed this transaction for approximately $1.5 billion using existing cash of the Company, increasing its ownership interest in
Walmart Chile to 99.7 percent . In March 2014, the Company completed a tender offer for most of the remaining noncontrolling interest shares at the same value
per share as was paid to the redeemable noncontrolling interest shareholders. As a result of completing these transactions, the Company owns substantially all of
Walmart Chile.
Vips Restaurant Business in Mexico
In fiscal 2014, Walmex, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement with Alsea S.A.B. de C.V. to sell the Vips restaurant
business ("Vips") in Mexico. The sale of Vips was completed on May 12, 2014 . The Company received $671 million of cash and recognized a net gain of $262
million in discontinued operations at the time of the sale.

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,
India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and
Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results its chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze
performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify
revenues for each of these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as
walmart.com. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites. The Sam's Club
segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not
allocated to any of the Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate
overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,
as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are
reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income
taxes, is provided in the following table:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 31, 2016 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. at
January 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2016 , in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 30, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
We have audited Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying "Management's Report to Our Shareholders." Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , based on the
COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , and related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and
redeemable noncontrolling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2016 and our report dated March 30, 2016 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report to Our Shareholders
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Management of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "company" or "we") is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart's Consolidated
Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report to Shareholders. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to
make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors, oversees our process of reporting financial information and the
audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart and regularly reviews management's
financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial

Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2016 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2016 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report to Shareholders.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be timely disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to management in a timely fashion. Management has assessed the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2016 ,
and determined they were effective as of that date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was accumulated and communicated to management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

Door" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are
encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart.
Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance
with the law in the conduct of Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates who are part of
management. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers. Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction
Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit Committee. The
senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which
oversees and administers several reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to make confidential and
anonymous complaints regarding potential violations of our statements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters.
